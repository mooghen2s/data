 Inside the Daoist temple.
 Han Jue suddenly felt uneasy.
 He opened his eyes and looked up. His gaze traveled through the 33rd Heaven and saw a huge battle.
 South Extreme Heavenly Venerate, Sect Master Tian Jue, Qiu Xilai, Fuxitian, and Emperor Xiao attacked a black hole together. Their Mystical Powers were endless and their Dharma treasures were powerful.
 “What?”
 Han Jue frowned and looked at the black hole.
 What made him uneasy was not the battle, but the mysterious existence in the black hole.
 This feeling…
 Han Jue thought of how he felt when he first faced the Inauspicious Evil.
 Could this be related to the Dark Forbidden Zone?
 Han Jue called the Strange Deity over and sent it the scene of the 33rd Heaven, scaring it.
 It began to wave frantically.
 Through telepathy, Han Jue knew what it meant.
 Danger!
 It was very dangerous!
 Extreme danger!
 The Strange Deity’s first reaction was to escape!
 Han Jue frowned and suppressed the uncontrollable Strange Deity in the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus.
 “I want to know if I can defeat what the Sages are facing?”
 [Ten billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [Possible)
 Possible?
 Han Jue’s heart almost exploded. That meant that he could be defeated!
 Not to mention being defeated, Han Jue wanted to insta-kill the enemy.
 No!
 Han Jue continued to derive, “I want to know its identity!”
 This time, his lifespan was not deducted.
 [Dao Heavenly Devil: Cultivation unknown, transformed by negative karma, an extremely evil existence.]
Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels Han Jue immediately took out the Book of Misfortune and started cursing the Dao Heavenly Devil.
 Five days later, his lifespan began to decrease.
 As he cursed, he watched the battle in the 33rd Heaven. The Dao Heavenly Devil did not seem to be affected by the curse. Facing the attacks of the Sages, its aura did not decrease.
 Han Jue hurriedly stopped. Cursing the enemy consumed too much lifespan. It was better to derive it directly.
 Cursing Sage Jin’an until he went mad was enough for Han Jue to derive hundreds of questions about Sages.
 “I want to know if my curse can work on Dao Heavenly Devil?”
 [Ten billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [No, he has the power of curses, to begin with.]
 Han Jue showed a frown.
 This was a little inexplicable.
 Han Jue stood up and activated all his Supreme Treasures. Divine light shone brightly and illuminated his body.
 He followed and arrived above the Sages of the 33rd Heaven.
 His appearance pleasantly surprised the Sages.
 “Han Jue, hurry up and kill this demon!” Qiu Xilai shouted.
 Han Jue immediately used the simulation trial to copy the Dao Heavenly Devil’s data and then disappeared.
 The Sages were stunned for a moment before continuing to attack.
 In an instant, Han Jue received several messages that the Hatred Points had increased.
 He didn’t mind and started the simulation trial.
 An hour later, Han Jue opened his eyes and frowned.
 What a Dao Heavenly Devil!
 How powerful!
 Han Jue had to use all his Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols to kill it.
 Before this, he had almost been killed by Dao Heavenly Devil many times.
 Powerful enemy!
 This was definitely the strongest enemy Han Jue had ever encountered.
 Han Jue continued the simulation trial and looked for a way to insta-kill the Dao Heavenly Devil.
 He kept trying
 Two years passed.
 Han Jue still didn’t find a way to insta-kill the Dao Heavenly Devil. Fortunately, he had already become a Sage. Otherwise, his black hair would definitely have turned white.
 (Qiu Xilai wants to visit you in your dreams. Do you accept?]
 [Qiu Xilai wants to visit you in your dreams. Do you accept?)
 This lunatic was spamming again!
 Han Jue thought of the Dao Heavenly Devil and agreed to the dream.
 In the dream.
 Qiu Xilai was still majestic and domineering. He looked down at Han Jue and said in a low voice, “The Heavenly Devil attacked. Why did you only take a look and leave?”.
 Han Jue was angry in his mind. He had fought for two years to deal with the Dao Heavenly Devil. Even if he didn’t contribute, he had worked hard.
 He retorted. “Could it be that the Sages can’t deal with the Heavenly Devil?”
 “That’s right. We will all suffer a backlash. Sooner or later, the Heavenly Devil will enter the 33rd Heaven. At that time, we will all die. Even the Heavenly Dao and all living beings will be devoured. Your Hundred Peak Immortal River can forget about escaping.”
 Qiu Xilai’s tone was filled with resentment.
 Han Jue remained silent.
 Qiu Xilai sighed. “The Heavenly Dao is in danger. The next time the Heavenly Devil attack, I hope you can take action and fight with us. Otherwise, the Heavenly Dao will be in danger.”
 Han Jue said, “I’ll consider it.”
 “Don’t just consider it, you have to come!”
 “Why? What do I owe the Heavenly Dao?”
 Han Jue was furious.
 This fellow was plotting against him with the Heavenly Dao. Don’t think that he didn’t know.
 However, Qiu Xilai had helped him in the previous calamity, so he did not directly attack him.
 Facing such a tough nut, Qiu Xilai was also annoyed. He said, “If the Heavenly Dao is destroyed, where can you go?” “That’s it!”
 Han Jue waved his right hand and forcefully broke through Qiu Xilai’s dream.
 In the Dao Field.
 Qiu Xilai opened his eyes with a solemn expression.
 “This kid is already so strong?”
 A storm brewed in his heart. Although Han Jue was a Sage, he had always felt that he wasn’t at his level. After all, the two of them had never fought.
 But just now…
 The appearance of the Dao Heavenly Devil gave Han Jue a sense of urgency. He began to cultivate in seclusion and comprehended the Great Dao of Extreme Origin every day. The living beings of the Immortal World did not sense that a calamity was coming. Some cultivated, some searched for treasures, some preached the Dao, and some fought.
 All living beings had all sorts of forms. The cycle of reincarnation changed and formed a set of rules.
 In a cave.
 Li Daokong was meditating and healing his injuries. A sword floated behind him, emitting the aura of a Heavenly Sovereign.
 He slowly opened his eyes and muttered, “Although the Ten Thousand Life Sword is strong, my Dharmic powers are inferior to Shi Dudao’s. I still have to increase my cultivation, but my cultivation speed is too slow. It seems that I can only seek the help of a Supreme Treasure.”
 Li Daokong urgently wanted to defeat Shi Dudao. If he couldn’t defeat him, it would become his mental demon.
 At this moment, a voice came from the foot of the cave.
 “May I ask if Senior is Li Daokong of the Hidden Sect?”
 Li Daokong ignored him and closed his eyes again.
 The voice sounded. “Your Hidden Sect disciple is in danger. If you don’t save him, he will definitely die.”
 Li Daokong opened his eyes and sucked the person into the cave.
 This person was dressed gorgeously and had a handsome face. He had an immortal aura.
 He knelt down on one knee and cupped his fists. “I’m Han Ming. This child was captured by the Jie School.”
 He waved his hand and a figure appeared beside him. It was Han Tuo.
 Li Daokong was stunned when he saw Han Tuo’s face.
 Too similar!
 It was simply like Han Jue.
 Li Daokong pinched his fingers to deduce and discovered that Han Tuo’s karma was extremely vague.
 Could it be…
 A hundred years later.
 Han Jue opened his eyes. He was still very far from the mid-stage Primordial Chaos Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm. This made him very frustrated.
 It had been a long time since he had broken through. He wasn’t used to it.
 The Dao Heavenly Devil could attack at any time. Han Jue hoped that he could have the strength to insta-kill the Dao Heavenly Devil before that. He had to check his emails to calm down.
