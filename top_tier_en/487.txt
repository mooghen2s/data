 (Book of Misfortune upgraded from a Zenith Heaven Supreme Treasure to a Heavenly Dao Numinous Treasure.]
 There was no Pseudo-Sage level!
 It was directly at the Heavenly Dao level!
 Han Jue was in a good mood.
 He did not curse Sage Fated Secrets immediately but continued cultivating.
 He wasn’t far from breaking through. He had to cultivate to the late-stage Pseudo-Sage Realm first!
 More than six thousand years had passed since the last breakthrough.
 Han Jue turned around and felt that time passed so quickly, as if it was yesterday.
 The early-stage Heavenly Dao had no grudges or conflicts. The definition of time was not obvious. All living beings were busy cultivating
 Although various providence sects were wandering the Immortal World, the world was vast. It wasn’t difficult for them to hide and cultivate.
 On the other side.
 Outside the 33rd Heaven.
 In the palace, Sage Fated Secrets suddenly felt uneasy.
 For some reason, he felt like a calamity was coming. This feeling had not appeared since he had attained the Dao.
 He immediately thought of the Dark Forbidden Lord.
 In the past few decades, the Dark Forbidden Lord had not cursed him.
 Was he preparing something?
 The more Sage Fated Secrets thought about it, the more panicked he became.
 He also thought that the other Sages had been interacting closely recently and seemed to be alienating him.
 “No, I have to rope in an ally. Qiu Xilai is not reliable.”
 Sage Fated Secrets’ eyes flickered. He immediately stood up and left.
 Three hundred years later.
 Han Jue finally had a chance to break through.
 He directly entered seclusion. In fifty years, he successfully broke through. Feeling, Han Jue checked his attributes panel.
 [Name: Han Jue]
 [Race: Primordial Fiendcelestial (Immeasurable Emperor)]
 (Cultivation: Late-stage of the Pseudo Primordial Chaos Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm]
 [Technique: Primordial Chaos Reincarnation Great Dao (Great Dao), Heavenly Cycle Body Tempering] [Great Dao: Great Dao of Life and Death, Great Dao of Karma, Great Dao of Extreme Origin]
 Great!
 His lifespan doubled again!
 Han Jue was getting closer and closer to becoming a Sage!
 He continued to consolidate his cultivation. After consolidating his cultivation, he would deal with Sage Fated Secrets!
 Forty-nine years later. Han Jue finished consolidating his cultivation.
 He was about to take out the Book of Misfortune when he felt a powerful aura.
 Extending his divine sense, he saw a sword Qi sweep over from the end of the horizon. It collided with Zu Tu’s palm and cut it into two. Blood splattered across the ground.
 The two halves of the palm trembled violently and wanted to heal. Another sword Qi interwove and shattered the palm.
 Han Jue raised his eyebrows.
 What a powerful sword Qi!
 The other party was at least a Pseudo-Sage!
 Furthermore, this sword Qi looked familiar.
 Han Jue looked over and saw a white-robed swordsman flying over on sword Qi.
 Eh?
 Isn’t this Li Daokong?
 Li Daokong stopped in front of Zu Tu’s palm and looked down at the mountain of meat. He frowned.
 “This murderous aura is essentially demonic Qi. Could it be that the Devil Ancestor is plotting something?” Li Daokong thought silently.
 His gaze landed on the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 He had long heard of it.
 This time, he was not here for Zu Tu’s palm, but for the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 Flying forward, he raised his hand to touch an invisible formation. He secretly activated his Dharmic powers and felt that his Dharmic powers were blocked by an extremely strong force, then directly melted.
Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com What a powerful formation!
 Li Daokong raised his eyebrows and asked, “Sect Master of the Hidden Sect, I’m the eldest disciple of the Human School, Li Daokong. I’m here to ask about cultivation!”
 He had long heard of the Hidden Sect.
 The Heavenly Emperor of the Heavenly Court was a disciple of the Hidden Sect!
 Han Jue’s voice floated over slowly. “Fellow Daoist Li, you’re so powerful. I’m not your match. Forget it.”
 He asked silently, “Was Li Daokong arranged to be here by a Sage?”
 [2 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [It’s not a Sage’s arrangement. He’s just curious about you.]
 Curious?
 Han Jue was speechless.
 Does this fellow still want to take me in as his disciple?
 “Han Jue, aren’t you letting me in? Are you worried that I’ll attack you? I, Li Daokong, never ambush or scheme.”
 Li Daokong’s voice floated over.
 Han Jue continued to ask in his mind, “If Li Daokong comes in, will I be in danger?”
 (No]
 This time, his lifespan was not deducted. Perhaps the system had already checked Li Daokong’s motives.
 Han Jue asked, “Is Li Daokong loyal to the Human School?”
 (2 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [Although he is loyal, he is not a fanatic.]
 Han Jue narrowed his eyes and felt that it was feasible.
 The Human School’s structure was complicated. There were only two disciples on the surface, but there were countless disciples in the dark. Jiang Dugu and Li Daokong were both from the Human School, but they were already mortal enemies. Li Daokong would definitely be dissatisfied.
 Han Jue said, “Come in.”
 He directly wrapped him with his divine sense. Li Daokong did not resist and was sucked into the Daoist temple.
 After landing, Li Daokong’s gaze landed on Han Jue.
 “You’ve actually reached the Pseudo-Sage Realm!” Li Daokong said with a burning gaze, his heart filled with shock.
 This talent was too terrifying!
 When he first met Han Jue, Li Daokong only felt that he was a prodigy. After ten thousand years, this prodigy actually surpassed him.
 Li Daokong knew his potential very well. His breakthrough speed was already the fastest in the calamity, but compared to Han Jue…
 He thought of what Li Muyi had told him and seemed to understand something.
 Han Jue smiled and said, “If you had been cultivating in seclusion, you would have long become a Sage.”
 He waved his hand, causing a mat to appear on the ground. He then gestured for Li Daokong to sit down.
 After Li Daokong sat down, he smiled and said, “It’s not that easy to attain the Dao. You need great providence. However, I’ve already obtained enough providence in the previous calamity. I’m only lacking the Primordial Purple Qi.”
 Han Jue asked, “Is there a Heavenly Dao Sage in the Human School now?”
 Li Daokong said, “Yes, but my master created his own Little Heavenly Dao. It’s not inferior to the Heavenly Dao of the Immortal World.”
 “Doesn’t that mean that the Human School also has a Primordial Purple Qi?”
 Han Jue only knew of eight Heavenly Dao Sages.
 Nüwa, Fuxitian, South Extreme Heavenly Venerate, Qiu Xilai, Sect Master Tian Jue, Sage Fated Secrets, Sage Jin’an, and Emperor Xiao. Not to mention that Nüwa had perished, a Heavenly Dao Sage had yet to appear. He guessed that he was hiding in the Human School.
 Li Daokong said, “That’s right. If there are no accidents, I will be the next Heavenly Dao Sage. Do you want to acknowledge me as your master?”
 Han Jue asked, “Is it the position of Sage Nüwa or the Human School?”
 “It’s naturally Empress Nüwa’s position.”
 “Oh?”
 Han Jue relaxed. So this fellow was also deceived by a Sage.
 Han Jue said in surprise, “Sage Li Muyi said that he wanted to give me the Primordial Purple Qi. Why did he also promise it you?”
 Li Daokong frowned.
 Han Jue continued, “Not only Li Muyi, but also Sage Qiu Xilai. He also said that he wanted to give me Nüwa’s Primordial Purple Qi and let me fight for providence and fame first. How many Primordial Purple Qi does Nüwa have?”
 Li Daokong snorted. “It seems that you and I are both pawns. I’m afraid you and I aren’t the only ones. Actually, I came to find you for another goal.
 “I want to create a New Human School!”
