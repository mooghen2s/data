 Under the Heavenly Dao, Han Jue’s reputation was extremely small. He was even inferior to ordinary mortals.
 It was as if he was watching a movie but it skipped to the ending.
 However, this made Han Jue more confident.
 As long as he did expose his identity as a Primordial Fiendcelestial, he did not have to worry about anything happening. After all, the Sages didn’t know what the Primordial Fiendcelestial was.
 Han Jue stopped thinking and continued cultivating, patiently waiting for the Immeasurable Calamity to end.
 Qiu Xilai had already promised to protect the people around him. If he couldn’t do it, Han Jue wouldn’t have any relationship with the Buddhist Sect.
 As for those good friends who died in the calamity, they deserved it. Han Jue had already reminded them that they were the ones who wanted to fight.
 Han Jue could help them, but he wouldn’t save them at all costs.
 “A Sage will die here. Is it really Fuxitian?”
 Han Jue was secretly curious.
 The death of a Zenith Heaven cultivator would cause golden rain to fall on the world. What about the death of a Sage? What would happen, then?
 He set a goal to reach the perfected Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm before the calamity ended.

 The demise of the Buddhist Sect caused a huge commotion in the myriad worlds. First, the Immortal World’s Buddhas announced the dissolution of the Buddhist Sect. The branches of the Buddhist Sect that remained in the myriad worlds also disappeared one after another.
 The colossus that had once enveloped the Heavenly Dao no longer existed. It was truly impressive.
 For a time, the various factions were panicked, including the humans and the Heavenly Court.
 Numinous Palace.
 Fang Liang was discussing the battle with the immortals when a Heavenly Soldier rushed in.
 “Report-Sage Nüwa has descended into the mortal world and is preaching to the humans!”
 With that said, all the immortals were moved. Fang Liang also frowned.
 Fuxitian had already made the immortals despair. If another Heavenly Dao Sage came, how many immortals would die?
 They could all tell that although the Heavenly Court also had the help of Sages, they had never saved them and only slaughtered humans.
 The number of living beings in the humans and Heavenly Court kept decreasing. If this continued, both sides would suffer heavy losses and fall together.
 Fang Liang asked, “Have any new races risen in the Immortal World recently?”
 An old immortal replied, “Yes, dozens of them, but they are not a threat.”
 The immortals looked at each other.
 They weren’t stupid. They knew why Fang Liang was paying attention to this information. The actions of the Sages caused the humans and immortals to be bitterly disappointed. They could guess the Sages’ intentions. They wanted the two forces to kill each other and then choose a new protagonist of the Heavenly Dao!
 Even though they knew, they did not dare to refute, afraid that the Sages would be angry. Moreover, the two factions had fought for so many years. The hatred was like a sea of blood that seeped into the bones and could not be resolved. The low-level cultivators and Heavenly Soldiers didn’t know the Sages’ intentions and only felt that the higher-ups had compromised.
 This was the general trend!
 They could no longer retreat.
 Li Daokong asked, “When will you save Su Qi?”
 Not far away, the Martial God General shook his head and said, “He’s suppressed by a Sage. It’s not easy to save him.”
 Li Xuan’ao mocked, “Then, if you’re suppressed by a Sage, do you want us to save
 you?”
 The Martial God General was furious, but he did not dare to answer.
 At this moment, another Heavenly Soldier rushed in.
 “Report-A new Human Emperor has appeared in the Human Race. It’s Zhou Fan, who fought against the God of Misfortune previously!”
 The immortals were in an uproar and discussed.
 “Isn’t Zhou Fan dead?”
 “He can actually escape from a Sage?”
 “Since ancient times, he’s probably the first. Isn’t he only an Immortal Emperor?”
 “He’s not just an Immortal Emperor. He has already stepped into the Deity Realm!”
 “Could it be that the Sage has shown mercy?” “Then, what about us? The Sages are acting for us and using us as whetstones for the humans?”
 Upon knowing that Zhou Fan was still alive, the immortals were furious. They felt that they had been played by a Sage.
 Apart from Sages, how could anyone escape from them?
 Fang Liang had a complicated expression and felt even more so.
 He wanted Zhou Fan to live, but he was also angry at the Sage’s reckless actions.
 “Could it be that the ones destined to perish are not humans, but immortals?”
 Fang Liang smiled bitterly. The hundreds of years of battle were almost unbearable for him. He had never rested much, let alone cultivated.
 Forty years passed during Han Jue’s cultivation.
 On this day, he cursed Sage Fated Secrets while checking his emails.

 (Your good friend Jiang Dugu was attacked by a Sage and was severely injured.]
 (Your good friend Qiu Xilai was cursed by a mysterious curse.]
 Along the way, Han Jue saw two words.
 How tragic!
 They were all fighting! Everyone seemed to have gone mad. They kept fighting until they died.
 Han Jue noticed that Qiu Xilai was actually cursed by a mysterious curse.
 This was a good thing. This meant that other than him, others were cursing the Sages.
 In other words, some among the Sages were causing trouble.
 Han Jue thought silently.
 At this moment, Hidden Sect Island suddenly shook.
 They were being attacked by the Inauspicious Evil again. Because it was not the first time, everyone was very calm.
 Han Jue suddenly sensed something and put away the Book of Misfortune. Then, he took out the Strange Deity from the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus.
 The Strange Deity floated in front of him and wandered around, seemingly anxious.
 Han Jue couldn’t help but think of the last time a Strange Deity appeared.
 Could it be that another Strange Deity had appeared?
 Han Jue checked the surrounding enemies.
 Indeed!
 [Inauspicious Deity: Cultivation unknown. A mysterious existence. Born in the Dark Forbidden Zone. It is formed by countless grudges over time. It is filled with killing intent and hatred.]
 The Inauspicious Deity was not a Strange Deity! The Strange Deity was formed by the providence of the Chaotic Fiendcelestial, while the Inauspicious Deity was formed by resentment and grudges. Han Jue didn’t panic. The Inauspicious Deity couldn’t break through the array defense of the Dao Field for the time being.
 “What price will there be to subdue the Inauspicious Deity?” Han Jue asked in his mind.
 (2 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 (The Inauspicious Deity is an extremely evil existence. It will not be tamed. Staying together, it is easy to develop mental demons.]
 So troublesome?
 Han Jue showed a frown.
 Boom!
 The Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain shook violently. The Black Hell Chicken’s cry came from outside the cave, “What is that!”
 The Inauspicious Deity had barged in!
 Han Jue immediately spread his divine sense and saw that above the sea at the edge of Hidden Sect Island, Lü Bu was fighting a black shadow.
 Both sides were very fast, but from Han Jue’s observation, the black shadow was even faster. Lü Bu’s Dharmic powers were directly devoured by the black shadow.
