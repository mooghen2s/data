 The Heavenly Devil Heart Protecting Jade was a Freedom Supreme Treasure that was even stronger than a Heavenly Dao Treasure.
 He took it out and started to make it recognize him as its owner.
 Then, he checked the new function of the system.
 Primordial Heavenly Prison!
 This was interesting.
 He could make powerful enemies submit and become his slave.
 Han Jue had a bold thought. Could he trick a mighty figure in and pretend to discuss the Dao, stall for time, and subtly subdue the other party?
 On second thought, it should not. After all, the system would change its will. How could it not notice this process?
 (Please choose the location of the Primordial Heavenly Prison.]
 The virtual map of the Dao Field appeared in front of him. Behind it was the landscape of the entire Hundred Peak Immortal River. The two maps overlapped.
 Han Jue chose his Daoist temple.
 This was the safest way. He would watch over it personally.
 [Primordial Heavenly Prison arranged successfully.)
 Han Jue looked around and didn’t feel anything different.
 He had to capture a living being to try.
 Who should he capture?
 Han Jue first thought of the Three Pure Sacred Ancestor.
 This fellow couldn’t be killed in the Heavenly Dao. He was the best test subject!
 Li Muyi didn’t seem to be in the Heavenly Dao’s territory. Perfect!
 Boom
 The Hundred Peak Immortal River suddenly shook violently. A dazzling pillar of light descended from the sky, piercing through the Dao Field and landing on Han Jue.
 Heavenly Dao Merit!
 The Dao Field wouldn’t reject such a force that was not an attack. Han Jue put away all the Heavenly Dao Merit and didn’t absorb it directly.
 He didn’t need Heavenly Dao Merit, but it could exist in a corner of the Primordial World.
 “Wait, I can use it to infiltrate the Immortal World.”
 Han Jue’s eyes lit up as he suddenly thought of a bold idea.
 He had to make the Heavenly Devil Heart Protecting Jade recognize him as its owner first!
 In the south of the Immortal World, in a continuous mountain, there was a Daoist temple halfway up the mountain. A huge cauldron in front of the door had smoke curling up.
 Han Jue suddenly appeared, his body wrapped in seven-colored light. This was the Heavenly Dao Merit.
 With the Heavenly Dao Merit, Han Jue would not be expelled by the Heavenly Dao.
 He looked at the Daoist temple and put the Three Pure Sacred Ancestor into his sleeve. With a shake of his body, he returned to the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 Inside the Daoist temple.
 Han Jue released the Three Pure Sacred Ancestor. Without waiting for him to react, his right hand quickly waved his Dharmic powers to suppress the Three Pure Sacred Ancestor’s Dao Fruit and seal his Dharmic powers.
 The Three Pure Sacred Ancestor couldn’t move. His eyes widened.
 “What’s happening?”
 The Three Pure Sacred Ancestor was shocked as unprecedented fear surged in his heart.
 This was the first time he had encountered such a situation.
 Even Sages couldn’t enter the Immortal World to capture him.
 The other party could only be stronger than a Heavenly Dao Sage!
 He had heard Li Muyi say that there were indeed people stronger than the Heavenly Dao Sages.
 Han Jue silently activated the Primordial Heavenly Prison.
 (Beginning imprisonment]
 The Three Pure Sacred Ancestor stared at him.
 Han Jue smiled calmly and said, “You’ll be a guest for a period of time and discuss the Dao with me.”
 The Three Pure Sacred Ancestor couldn’t speak, so he could only use his divine sense to ask who the other party was.
 “You’ve been here before, but you were defeated.”
 “Hundred Peak Immortal River. Are you the Hidden Sect’s master?”
 “Mm.”
 “Why are you imprisoning me?”
 “You will understand in the future.”
 The Three Pure Sacred Ancestor fell silent.
 Unable to break free, he did not want to talk anymore.
 He could only wait quietly for Li Muyi to save him.
 However, his heart sank when he thought of how Li Muyi had recently left the Heavenly Dao.
 It was said to be a discussion of the Dao, but in the end, there was still no discussion.
 The Daoist temple fell into silence. To prevent any accidents, Han Jue let Zhang Jue in to look at the Three Pure Sacred Ancestor while he cultivated in peace.
 The Three Pure Sacred Ancestor was dumbfounded when he saw Zhang Jue.
 Li Muyi!
 Impossible!
 This time, his mind was in chaos.
 Did Li Muyi order Han Jue to capture him?
Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates He hurriedly used his divine sense to ask Zhang Jue, but he did not answer at all. He was expressionless as if he had no emotions.
 The Three Pure Sacred Ancestor’s heart sank and his faith shattered.
 He thought that the master he had always protected had betrayed him!
 The Three Pure Sacred Ancestor fell into unprecedented confusion.
 Han Jue ignored him and focused on cultivating
 He had benefited greatly from the battle with the Dao Heavenly Devil. Unlike the simulation trial, the excitement brought by true battle couldn’t be simulated.
 In the simulation trial, Han Jue knew that he wouldn’t die, so he was fearless in battle. His mental state was definitely different from real battles.
 The Daoist temple fell into silence, but the Hundred Peak Immortal River was very lively. Not only the Hundred Peak Immortal River but also the myriad worlds in the universe. They were all lively and noisy.
 The name of the Immeasurable Merit Divine Might Heavenly Sage resounded throughout the myriad worlds!
 This Heavenly Devil Calamity affected the myriad worlds in the universe. The calamity was unprecedentedly serious. The Sect Master of the Hidden Sect did not save a world this time, but the entire Heavenly Dao. The merit was far greater than the merit of creating races and preaching in the past! It was the truth. The merit Han Jue absorbed was extremely huge. It was as dazzling as a bright sun in the Primordial World.
 Year after year passed.
 More and more living beings appeared around the Hundred Peak Immortal River. They were all here to seek the Dao. Even if the Hundred Peak Immortal River ignored them, many persistent people insisted on staying.
 In the entire Immortal World, statues of the Immeasurable Merit Divine Might Heavenly Sage were erected everywhere. However, they didn’t know Han Jue’s appearance, so there were all kinds of statues.
 The Hidden Sect hid from the world and Li Daokong did not return, so the million disciples quickly fell into their previous cultivation state. However, every time they heard the living beings outside the Dao Field praise the Immeasurable Merit Divine Might Heavenly Sage, they were very excited and felt proud.
 Time passed quickly.
 In the blink of an eye, eight hundred years passed.
 [Primordial Heavenly Prison has successfully enslaved the target.)
 [The Three Pure Sacred Ancestor has a favorable impression of you. Current favorability: Max.]
 Just as this notification appeared, Han Jue suddenly sensed something.
 He established a connection with the Three Pure Sacred Ancestor.
 This connection was very similar to the Six Paths Insignia. If he wanted the Three Pure Sacred Ancestor to die, he would definitely die. This feeling was extremely strange, but it was indeed true.
 Han Jue was pleasantly surprised. The Primordial Heavenly Prison was indeed a little powerful.
 Come to think of it, with the existence of max favorability, six stars weren’t the highest?
 Not bad!
 Han Jue felt that he had to reevaluate his favorability.
 He opened his eyes to look at the Three Pure Sacred Ancestor.
 The other party was still meditating.
 Han Jue asked, “Three Pure Sacred Ancestor?”
 The other party opened his eyes and bowed respectfully. “Greetings, Dao Lord!”
 Han Jue sized him up and said, “Kneel.”
 The Three Pure Sacred Ancestor immediately knelt down.
 “Roll.”
 The Three Pure Sacred Ancestor immediately rolled around.
 “Slap yourself in the face.”
 This time, Han Jue completely believed it. After all, the Three Pure Sacred Ancestor didn’t know the Primordial Heavenly Prison’s function. Even if he pretended, he didn’t have to work so hard.
 Han Jue immediately helped him up. “Three Pure, I’m just testing you. Sorry. I needed you too much. You’re the number one in the Immortal World. My Hidden Sect needs an expert like you…”
 He began to praise the Three Pure Sacred Ancestor, who was very touched.
 After some communication, Han Jue discovered that the Three Pure Sacred Ancestor didn’t completely lose his intelligence. He only subtly trusted Han Jue completely. He still had his own thoughts.
 Han Jue decided to let the Three Pure Sacred Ancestor out. He might even be a spy beside Li Muyi.
 That day, he had moved the Three Pure Sacred Ancestor out. Other than Zhang Jue, no one knew about this. As for Li Muyi, he was probably still in the Chiliocosm World. Otherwise, he would have long come to visit.
 “This function doesn’t seem to have a price. I can spend time enslaving the entire Immortal World…”
