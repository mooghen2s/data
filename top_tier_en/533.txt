 Han Jue didn’t want to see him at first, but Han Zuitian said that there was something big.
 After entering the Daoist temple, Han Zuitian knelt down and bowed.
 Han Jue didn’t say anything.
 Han Zuitian looked up and said, “Grandmaster, recently, when I was taking care of the natural treasures under the Fusang Tree, it told me that it can already connect to more than a hundred space-time interfaces and even worlds that are not controlled by the Heavenly Dao. I think the Hidden Sect can develop in advance.
 “There are many living beings in the Hidden Sect whose potential has already reached the limit. They can’t improve on their cultivation. There’s no point in them staying here anymore.”
 Han Jue frowned. Under the light of the Sun and Moon Yin-Yang Protection, Han Zuitian couldn’t see his expression.
 Han Jue subconsciously wanted to refute, but he stopped.
 It had to be said that Han Zuitian’s words were indeed reasonable.
 Even with Han Jue preaching and the enhancement of the Dao Field, not all living beings could cultivate endlessly. Living beings with mediocre potential could at most cultivate to the Immortal Emperor Realm.
 Not long ago, the Emperor Realm was far beyond Han Jue’s reach.
 Since staying was useless, they could do as Han Zuitian said.
 There was no need to do so in the area of the Heavenly Dao. It was fine outside the Heavenly Dao. At least, it was a good thing to understand the outside world.
 If these disciples encountered a powerful enemy that even Han Jue couldn’t defeat, he could just not save them.
 Han Jue asked, “You can’t increase your cultivation anymore?”
 Han Zuitian hurriedly replied, “I can. I don’t want to go out personally. I just made a suggestion. Many disciples want to contribute to the Hidden Sect, but they don’t have a chance. For example, the Long-arm Ape who just returned not long ago.”
 The Long-arm Ape went out to train for many years. After teaching its Mystical Power to the Long-arm Ape Race, it returned to the Hidden Sect.
 As for the secret mission given by Han Jue, it didn’t meet Han Tuo and could only give up.
 The reason why it returned was mainly that it had been defeated and lost to a Buddhist cultivator. Therefore, it wanted to return to cultivate and become stronger.
 Han Jue said, “Then, go down and calculate. After the next lecture, make arrangements.”
 Han Zuitian was pleasantly surprised and hurriedly nodded.
 He didn’t disturb Han Jue anymore and quickly left.
 Han Jue closed his eyes and continued cultivating.
 It wasn’t necessary for him to develop a force outside the Heavenly Dao, but he could still have one.
 Fifty years later.
 Han Jue checked his emails while cultivating. Now that he was reading his emails, he felt like he was playing with loot boxes.
 He wondered if something had happened to his unlucky friends.
 Happiness was built on the pain of others.
 [Your disciple, Ji Xianshen, was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure and was severely injured.)
 [Your grand-disciple Fang Liang was attacked by the True Dragon Race] x123021
 (Your good friend Qiu Xilai has fused with the Heavenly Dao power and suffered a backlash. His Sage Heart has been damaged.]
 (Your good friend Zhang Guxing was attacked by Jie School cultivators] x763
 [Your good friend, the Heavenly Emperor, has established the Ruins of End Heavenly Court. His providence has increased greatly.]
 (Your good friend Empress Houtu was cursed by a mysterious curse.)
 (Your good friend Tai Sutian has received guidance from a Sage. Her cultivation has increased greatly.)
 (Your good friend Han Ming was attacked by your son Han Tuo.]
 Wasn’t Ji Xianshen a Pseudo-Sage?
 He was severely injured just like that?
 It was a little ridiculous!
 Han Jue frowned. He was angry when he read the emails.
 However, he was amused upon seeing that Qiu Xilai had failed to fuse with the Heavenly Dao power.
 The worst thing for his enemies was to have an ally that caused them trouble.
 He read on. There was a lot of information.
 The Heavenly Emperor established the Heavenly Court and started his old empire again.
 Han Jue was very worried about the Heavenly Emperor. He could only pray that there was another Han Jue in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End who could help him overcome the obstacles.
 When Han Jue saw Han Tuo attacking Han Ming, his expression became strange.
 He had indeed neglected Han Tuo recently. Did anything happen when the two of them met?
 Han Jue pinched his fingers to deduce.
 Han Tuo was actually still with Han Ming. The two of them seemed to have a good relationship and were adventuring in a place filled with restrictions.
 The two of them were too weak. A Rank Nine Immortal Emperor was secretly watching them with ill intentions.
 “Eh, this kid actually grasped the Chaotic Fiendcelestial Dharma Idol?”
 Han Jue was suddenly surprised. He didn’t expect the Grand Unity Aspect to be inherited through his bloodline. Although there was only one Fiendcelestial Dharma Idol in the depths of Han Tuo’s soul, it was enough.
 This kid also had the capital to cross realms to kill enemies.
 Yeah.
 His Golden Finger!
 Han Jue was satisfied with Han Tuo’s current development. Under the circumstances of bloodline suppression and no backing, his cultivation until now was not bad.
 “When this kid is about to die, I’ll bring him back to the Hidden Sect to cultivate.”
 Han Jue thought silently.
 As for Han Ming, compared to Han Tuo, he was too mediocre. In this life, he would at most barely reach the Deity Realm.
 [Li Muyi wants to visit you in your dreams. Do you accept?] A notification suddenly appeared and interrupted his thoughts.
 Han Jue ignored him.
 (Li Muyi wants to visit you in your dreams. Do you accept?]
 (Li Muyi wants to visit you in your dreams. Do you accept?]
 Li Muyi started to spam.
 Han Jue was a little surprised. Li Muyi wasn’t such an impatient person.
 Did something happen?
 “If I accepted Li Muyi’s dream, will my life be in danger?”
 (4 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [No]
T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by nov(ê(l)biin.co/m Han Jue immediately relaxed and accepted Li Muyi’s dream.
 He wanted to see what this old thing had to say.
 The dream began.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and discovered that he had arrived at a small pavilion. The mountains outside were undulating and the mountains were beautiful. It was refreshing.
 Li Muyi sat in front of him. There was a chessboard on the stone table between the two.
 Li Mu asked expressionlessly, “Do you know how to play?”
 Han Jue glanced at it and said, “You want to challenge me in Gomoku?”
 “What’s Gomoku?”
 “The winner is the one who connects five pieces first.”
 “Childish and boring. Forget it, I’ll get straight to the point.”
 Li Muyi shook his head and waved his right hand. The chessboard vanished.
 Han Jue cursed silently. How dare he look down on him!
 This was also good. Although Han Jue knew how to play Go, his skills were average. He probably couldn’t win against Li Muyi. There was no need to ask for trouble.
 Li Muyi said, “You aren’t a Heavenly Dao Sage, but you have used your strength to attain the Dao. You seem to be very wary of the Heavenly Dao. If you want to advance another level, you need to create your own Heavenly Dao. I have already created a Little Heavenly Dao. It’s not inferior to the current Immortal World, but my providence is insufficient. I would like to invite you to create a new Heavenly Dao.”
 Han Jue asked, “What do you mean? You want me to build your Heavenly Dao with you?”
 Li Muyi shook his head. “I want you to create your own Heavenly Dao, but place it near my Heavenly Dao. In the future, we can resist the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity together. In the past tens of thousands of years, a mysterious existence has been driving the Inauspicious Evil of the Dark Forbidden Zone. It’s probably the sign of the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity.”
 Han Jue showed a frown.
 What was Li Muyi doing?
 He had been plotting against him previously, but now, he wanted to rope him in?
 He’s so anxious. Did something happen?
 “I’ll consider this,” Han Jue said.
 Li Muyi sighed. “There’s one more thing. I want to trouble you. Recently, my Heavenly Dao has been targeted. The other party is a Freedom Sage, and he has also walked the path of attaining the Dao through strength. I’m not his match. Once the other Heavenly Dao Sages leave the Heavenly Dao, their cultivation levels will be no different from that of a Pseudo-Sage. I can only rely on you.”
