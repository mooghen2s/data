 300 billion years!
 400 billion years! 500 billion years!
 Han Jue’s eyes turned red. This time, he was determined to kill Great Nine Heavens.
 Because of him, the Heavenly Emperor had been possessed by an inferior Strange Deity. Now, he had even fallen into a state where he was neither god nor ghost.
 It was also this fellow who helped Jade Emperor Zhou Yan win providence and slaughter all living beings. If not for Han Jue changing the calamity, the people around him might have died in the other party’s hands.
 He had to die!
 Han Jue didn’t have many direct enemies, but as long as it threatened the lives of the people around him, he wouldn’t let it go.
 This time, he wanted to break through the limits of his curse.
 600 billion years!
 [Because of your curse, your enemy Great Nine Heavens has developed mental demons.)
 [Great Nine Heavens’ hatred towards you has increased. Current Hatred Points: 6 stars]
 700 billion years! Han Jue finally felt a little dizzy, but it was nothing.
 (Because of your curse, your enemy Great Nine Heavens suffered from mental demons. His Dharmic powers surged and his Zenith Heaven Dao Fruit shattered.]
 800 billion years!
 Go and die!
 Han Jue was about to go mad. Why was this fellow so hard to kill?
 How much lifespan had he spent cursing Zenith Heaven existences?
 Could this fellow be the number one among the Pseudo-Sages?
 900 billion years!
 [Because of your curse, your enemy Great Nine Heavens suffered a backlash to his soul. His Dao heart collapsed and he perished. He died.]
 Han Jue immediately stopped.
 His forehead was covered in a cold sweat.
 He was sweating as a Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal. If news of this spread, it would probably become a huge joke. Han Jue checked his interpersonal relationships. Great Nine Heavens’ portrait had disappeared.
 He was really dead.
 He put down the Book of Misfortune and heaved a sigh of relief.
 900 billion years.
 Although Han Jue’s heart ached, he felt that it was worth it.
 If he didn’t kill this potential enemy, it would definitely be extremely troublesome in the future.
 Han Jue didn’t want powerful enemies to appear in front of him. He wanted to kill them before they appeared.
 The enemy who could appear in front of him was definitely someone he could insta-kill!
 Otherwise, it would be unstable!
 “Great Nine Heavens is dead. The future of the calamity will definitely change, but I don’t have to calculate. I’m far from the calamity now. I can calculate it when the world changes.”
 Han Jue thought silently.
 He had always been changing the calamity, so the outcome would always change.
 Unless he stopped, the future would change.
 What Han Jue needed to do was to wait for a future that he was satisfied with. However, it was obvious that a Sage was pushing for the calamity. Previously, a future that satisfied him had also appeared, but it still changed.
 Now, Han Jue didn’t expect to predict the future. He only hoped to eliminate potential enemies through it.
 With Great Nine Heavens’ death, Han Jue didn’t know who to curse now.
 Hao Tian was originally on his curse list, but ever since he and Long Hao fused, he couldn’t curse him anymore. Anyway, Hao Tian didn’t have any hatred towards Han Jue and couldn’t threaten the Heavenly Emperor now.
 “Forget it. It’s good that there’s no one to curse. I can cultivate peacefully.”
 Han Jue thought silently.
 Great Nine Heavens’ death did not cause any trouble, because, in the Immortal World, he was a nobody.
 A Pseudo-Sage died silently. No one knew. It was so tragic.
 With no enemies to curse, Han Jue focused on cultivating
 Twenty-three years later.
 A reaction came from the Chaotic Domain. Someone was calling him.
 Han Jue jumped into the Chaotic Domain, and the Strange Deity followed.
 Han Jue discovered that there was another person in the Chaotic Domain.
 Apart from Dao Sovereign and Zhao Xuanyuan, another person arrived.
 This person looked familiar.
 Wait!
 Han Jue hurriedly checked the emails.
 (Your good friend Zhou Fan has absorbed the essence of the Endless Sea of Blood. His body has transformed and he has obtained the Chaotic Physique.]
 That worked, too?
 Even if you’re a Sage, you can’t cheat like this, right?
 Why didn’t the Heavenly Dao strike him with lightning?
 Han Jue cursed silently.
 Dao Sovereign and the other two hurriedly came over. He was the first to speak. “This is the strongest prodigy who often saved us.” What strongest prodigy?! Han Jue didn’t dare to accept this title. There must be a trap. He didn’t acknowledge Zhou Fan. The four of them could only see each other’s figures and could not see their true faces.
 It had been thousands of years, so Zhou Fan naturally didn’t recognize Han Jue. After all, his Dharma treasures had been changed. Coupled with his clothes, his figure looked very different from before.
 “Greetings, Senior!” Zhou Fan said respectfully, his tone a little excited.
 This was a supreme domain!
 Under the Heavenly Dao, only the four of them had the Chaotic Physique. It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that they were the four with the greatest talent!
 How could Zhou Fan not be excited to join such a circle?
 Han Jue nodded slightly and asked in an extremely indifferent voice, “Did something happen again?”
 Zhao Xuanyuan lowered his head in embarrassment.
 Han Jue’s heart skipped a beat.
 Really?!
 Aren’t you afraid of death?
 Dao Sovereign coughed and said, “Ever since the Endless Sea of Blood, we followed the traces of the Devil Race and found the world created by the Primordial Devil Ancestor. After the calamity failed, the Primordial Devil Ancestor actually didn’t die. Instead, he learned from Giant God Pangu and created a world. We were trapped by a spell…”
 Han Jue interrupted, “Where’s the Supreme Treasure fragment that we talked about last time?”
 “It’s already been given to Heavenly Emperor Fang. You can take it at any time!”
 What about this time?
 “We discovered a lotus throne. It’s one of the Heavenly Dao Supreme Treasures. We can give it to you.”
 “So generous? Could it be that you can’t use it?”
 “I’m ashamed… We can’t use it, but we can’t leave it to the Primordial Devil Ancestor. Otherwise, the heavens will be in trouble.”
 Heh!
 How righteous!
 Han Jue ridiculed in his head and said, “Alright, I’ll help you send a message to Heavenly Emperor Fang.” “Thank you!”
 Dao Sovereign thanked him.
 Han Jue went off.
 Zhou Fan couldn’t help but ask, “Who is this senior?”
 For some reason, he felt familiar to him.
 Dao Sovereign said calmly, “I’m not sure, either. The previous Heavenly Emperor hid him very well. The new Heavenly Emperor Fang also admires him greatly. He must be a peerless mighty figure who cultivated the Chaotic Physique with the highest Dharmic powers. Back then, I still underestimated him. I didn’t expect him to save me so many times. How ironic.”
 Zhou Fan was even more curious now.
 Zhao Xuanyuan said, “Daoist Brother, how about I join this senior after I return?”
 Dao Sovereign glanced at him and asked, “What do you mean?”
 Zhao Xuanyuan smiled bitterly. “I’m a little weak. You guys are too…”
 Dao Sovereign was extremely daring, and Zhou Fan was simply a madman.
 Zhao Xuanyuan felt that he wasn’t on the same page as them. He was so talented and had a powerful background. There was no need to risk his life.
 Instead, he was very interested in Han Jue.
Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m He had a feeling that joining Han Jue was the greatest opportunity.
 “After this matter is over, you can do whatever you want.” Dao Sovereign snorted, feeling rather dissatisfied.
 Han Jue took out the Heavenly Dao Token and contacted Fang Liang.
 After Fang Liang learned of this, he was greatly shocked. “Have they gone mad? They actually provoked the Primordial Devil Ancestor! No Immortal God in the Heavenly Court can save them.”
 “So, you can’t save them?”
 “Of course.”
 “It’s fine. Let them die.”
 Han Jue shook his head. They were really asking for it.
 However, with Zhou Fan around, the three of them probably wouldn’t die.
 Fang Liang said, “I’ve already brought the Supreme Treasure Dao Sovereign promised you. Do you want to come and take it? I’ll use the Invocation Technique to invite you. Don’t worry, it won’t waste your time.”
