 Seven hundred years passed.
 The Immortal World had not changed much in the past seven hundred years. For example, the Hundred Peak Immortal River was still the same.
 Because the humans occupied the mountain area near the Hundred Peak Immortal River, the number of Connate lifeforms gathered decreased.
 After the humans experienced Dan Long’s lecture, many great cultivators appeared. The increase in strength caused the humans’ ambitions to rise. They began to hunt Connate lifeforms and ferocious beasts that had yet to transform.
 In their eyes, living beings who did not transform into humans were no different from ferocious beasts.
 Humans were the spirits of all living beings. The appearance of humans was also mysterious. Before there was a human, the appearance of all the living beings would be roughly the same. Nüwa had imitated the forms of living beings and created humans to obtain the recognition of the Heavenly Dao. Thus, humans became the first Heavenly Dao Race.
 The current Heavenly Race also maintained their human appearance. The Hidden Sect also saw the battle between the humans and the surrounding Connate lifeforms.
 Han Zuitian and the Connate lifeforms who were considered in-name disciples of the Hidden Sect were all very unhappy.
 We should cultivate well and not disturb each other.
 However, because of the Dao Field, they could only grit their teeth.
 Han Jue didn’t know about this as he had been cultivating in seclusion.
 He was still far from the perfected Pseudo-Sage Realm, but he could feel that he was improving On this day.
 Han Jue took out the Book of Misfortune and cursed Sage Fated Secrets while checking his emails.
 (Your good friend Pan Xin was attacked by a Pseudo-Sage and was severely injured.]
 [Your good friend Ji Xianshen accidentally entered the Primordial Phoenix Clan’s mystic realm.)
 (Your good friend Huang Zuntian was cursed by a mysterious curse.]
 (Your grand-disciple Fang Liang was cursed by a mysterious curse.]
 [Your good friend Divine General has comprehended a Mystical Power. His cultivation has increased greatly.]
 (Your good friend Empress Houtu received guidance from a mysterious mighty figure. Her cultivation has increased greatly.)
 (Your good friend Mo Zhu has received guidance from a Sage. Her cultivation has increased greatly.]
 Eh?
 The mysterious curse had appeared again!
 Han Jue raised his eyebrows. It seemed that the Dark Forbidden Lord still had many believers.
 Han Jue noticed Mo Zhu.
 She was still in Li Muyi’s hands. Back then, in order to build a relationship with him, Li Muyi had taken her into the Dao Field. Now that he had a conflict with Li Muyi and Mo Zhu had obtained the guidance of a Sage, he could smell a conspiracy.
 However, he did not care. Did he want to use Mo Zhu to threaten him?
 Impossible!
 Han Jue’s Dao heart was as firm as a rock and wouldn’t be affected.
 There was nothing worthy of his attention. The current Immortal World was still peaceful.
 Five days later, Han Jue continued cultivating.
 About twenty years passed.
 Beside the Hundred Peak Immortal River, a monk entered the human city.
 This monk looked to be in his forties. He wore a kasaya and held a scepter. Compared to the beast cloth worn by the humans, he was especially eye-catching. The moment he entered the city, he attracted the attention of the humans and pointed.
 “Amitabha,” the monk muttered softly, then began to wander around the city.
 Several days later, all sorts of legends about the Buddhist Sect spread throughout the city. The humans exclaimed.
 Unlike Dan Long, who directly preached the Dao, the monk popularized the various culture legends of the Buddhist Sect, letting the commoners know how mortals obtained the Dao through Buddhism. The story had a sense of immersion and was filled with motivation.
 On the other side.
 Chu Shiren went to visit Han Jue.
 “Grandmaster, the Buddhists have sent the Zen Buddha to join the Human Race. The Zen Buddha is best at bewitching people. If the Human Race is taken in by him, the Buddhists will stay beside the Hidden Sect. This is not a good thing,” Chu Shiren said seriously.
 He was once the Supreme Buddha. He knew the Buddhists very well and was even very familiar with their methods.
 Now that he was a disciple of the Hidden Sect, he naturally had to consider the sect.
 Han Jue said, “It’s fine. The Hundred Peak Immortal River is already isolated by my Mystical Power. No matter what the Buddhists do, they can’t take half a step into the Hundred Peak Immortal River.”
 Chu Shiren asked, “What if the humans beg
 you?”
 Han Jue said, “I’m not close to the current humans. The mortal world I came from is actually still around. It’s just that it’s hidden in the depths of my soul.”
 His eyes narrowed. His divine sense directly hooked Chu Shiren’s divine sense and pulled it into his world of stars, instantly arriving at the Reroll World.
 As for the world of stars, due to the concealment of the nebulous Primordial Qi, Chu Shiren could not spy on it.
 Chu Shiren’s divine sense covered the Reroll World, and he couldn’t help but become shocked.
RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only This mortal world…
 The White-Robed Buddha, who was cultivating, suddenly opened his eyes. Sensing Chu Shiren’s divine sense, he was secretly nervous. “Isn’t this the Supreme Buddha?”
 On second thought, the Supreme Buddha had already become Han Jue’s disciple. There was no need to worry.
 Several breaths later, Han Jue isolated Chu Shiren’s divine sense.
 Chu Shiren opened his eyes and took a deep breath. He sighed. “Grandmaster is really capable. The humans outside are indeed not worth mentioning. You have long left a seed for the humans. I truly admire you!”
 He was sincere. With Han Jue’s cultivation, the Reroll World was not beneficial to him at all. He could keep it because of his good intentions.
 There were too few cultivators like Han Jue who could still take care of the cultivators who were born in the mortal world.
 The higher one’s cultivation level, the weaker their humanity. They would eventually become Immortal God mighty figures who only lived for themselves.
 “Cultivate well. Actually, I value your potential the most. I hope that among the Hidden Sect disciples, you will be in the top three.” Han Jue stared at him.
 Chu Shiren nodded with a firm gaze.
 He wanted to help Han Jue reach the peak. At that time, he would open up a truly peaceful and kind Heavenly Dao World!
 After Chu Shiren left, Han Jue used the simulation trial to test the experts outside the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 [Zen Buddha: Early-stage Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm, one of the Buddhist Sect’s Buddhas.]
 Early-stage Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm!
 He wasn’t that weak.
 Han Jue couldn’t be bothered to enter the simulation trial and ignored him.
 Time passed quickly. More than a thousand years passed.
 In the blink of an eye, Han Jue was 25,000 years old.
 The Zen Buddha was very capable. The Human Race had already become Buddhist cultivators. Buddhist cultivators had a high status in the Human Race.
 On this day.
 A group of Buddhist cultivators arrived near the Hundred Peak Immortal River. The leader was an old monk.
 He knelt down first, and the other monks followed.
 “Is Ancestor Zhou Fan here?” the old monk shouted. The other monks began to kowtow.
 After a while, Zhou Fan’s voice floated over.
 “What is it?”
 He was very impatient. He hated the Buddhist Sect the most. He felt that he had been stabbed in the back when humans cultivated Buddhism.
 The old monk cried, “Please come out and save the humans. Recently, there has been a plague in the clan. Even immortals can’t treat it.”
 Inside the Daoist temple.
 Zhou Fan frowned.
 Were they trying to trick him out?
 At this moment, another voice sounded, “Hmph, the plague came at a good time. This is the punishment of the Heavenly Dao. The humans slaughtered Connate lifeforms without restraint and threw their corpses into the wilderness. This is a sin.”
 Li Xuan’ao’s voice sounded.
 The old monk continued crying, “Ancestor Zhou Fan, if you don’t come, the Human Race might go extinct!”
 As soon as he finished speaking, a terrifying gust of wind came from the Hundred Peak Immortal River and directly sent the group of monks flying. Not only them, but everyone in a radius of ten million kilometers was swept into the horizon, and the human city was directly razed to the ground.
 The humans in the wind were not ravaged, but they couldn’t control their bodies and could only be swept away by the wind.
 The entire Human Race had been moved away!
