 This fellow wants to stab Li Muyi in the back?
 Han Jue frowned and didn’t agree immediately.
 If Li Daokong really thought that, Li Muyi would definitely sense it.
 Sages were high and mighty and knew everything
 Seeing through his thoughts, Li Daokong said, “Don’t worry. I have a Heavenly Dao Supreme Treasure on me. Sages can’t capture my actions or spy on me.”
 Han Jue shook his head. “If that’s the case, shouldn’t Li Muyi be more afraid of you?”
 Li Daokong said calmly, “That’s right, so he trusts Jiang Dugu more.”
 Han Jue remained silent.
 Li Daokong continued to talk about his relationship with Jiang Dugu.
 Jiang Dugu was the Human School’s previous eldest disciple. He had become Li Muyi’s disciple and was equivalent to his senior. However, Li Daokong was Li Muyi’s adopted disciple. Jiang Dugu had joined Li Muyi at his peak.
 Jiang Dugu had an extremely high status in the Human Race. Because of him, the Human School’s status in the Human Race had increased greatly, so he was trusted by Li Muyi.
 In the previous Immeasurable Calamity, Li Daokong had followed Li Muyi’s orders to assist the Heavenly Court. Unexpectedly, the Heavenly Court had suddenly risen. Their opponents had died one after another and even threatened the Sage’s lineage. Li Muyi had Li Daokong and Jiang Dugu retreat.
 Li Daokong did not agree. He had already promised to help the Heavenly Court. How could he go back on his word?
 Moreover, in his opinion, it was good if the Heavenly Court won. They could end the calamity as soon as possible.
 Thus, he offended Li Muyi, and Jiang Dugu also appeared out of thin air and entered the calamity. After that, because the two of them were on their own, they often fought. They were furious, and now, it had even become a death grudge.
 Expressionless, Han Jue laughed in his heart.
 In that case, the estrangement between Li Daokong and Li Muyi was due to him, the Dark Forbidden Lord?
 Li Daokong looked at him with a burning gaze and said, “Are you willing to join me? I can make you the vice sect master.”
 Han Jue said helplessly, “How many disciples do you have?”
 “Not many, we can continue recruiting.”
 “When can you recruit to the size of our Hidden Sect?”

 Li Daokong fell silent.
 He couldn’t help but scan with his divine sense and discovered that there were actually more than ten thousand Immortal Emperors in the Hidden Sect!
 There were also several Zenith Heavens!
 This force…
 Impossible!
 Li Daokong was shocked.
 Han Jue said, “Why don’t you join my Hidden
 Sect?”
 In any case, Han Jue still admired Li Daokong.
 In the previous calamity, other than Sages, Li Daokong was the most prominent. His reputation as the number one sword immortal in the Heavenly Dao had long fallen on him.
 Most importantly, Li Daokong’s breakthrough speed had always been very fast.
 Li Daokong narrowed his eyes and said, “Aren’t you afraid of offending a Sage?”
 “If I create a New Human School with you, won’t I also offend a Sage? Besides, are you really confident in creating and controlling a providence sect?” Han Jue asked bluntly. In his impression, Li Daokong had always been fighting alone and occasionally brought his junior Li Xuan’ao along.
 Li Daokong fell silent again.
 He indeed did not have any experience in this area. The reason why he wanted to create a new sect was that he wanted to go against Li Muyi.
 Han Jue sighed secretly. It was indeed impossible to subdue Li Daokong so easily.
 “How about we spar?” Li Daokong looked up and asked.
 Han Jue thought for a moment and felt that he couldn’t hide anymore.
 He said, “I have a Mystical Power that can let us fight in an illusion. In the illusion, you can unleash your full strength.”
 Interested, Li Daokong nodded in agreement.
 Han Jue pulled him into the simulation trial and started fighting.
 To prevent Li Daokong from thinking there was something wrong with the simulation trial, Han Jue first adopted a defensive strategy and let him attack. After Li Daokong used his full strength, he would defeat him with one move.
 That’s right!
 Instant kill!
 The late-stage Pseudo-Sage Han Jue was able to insta-kill all existences under the Sages. Even the world-shattering Li Daokong was insta-killed!
 Several days later.
 Li Daokong left the Hundred Peak Immortal River. His expression was dark and his back was desolate.
 Under the Fusang Tree.
 Jiang Yi asked curiously, “He seems very unhappy. Did he fall out with Sect Master?”
 The Black Hell Chicken said, “Needless to say, he must have been taught a lesson in the simulation trial.”
 Jiang Yi was silent. He would indeed be very unhappy. Back then, he had spent a lot of time to walk out of the shadows.
 After Li Daokong left, Han Jue began to improve his Sword Dao Mystical Power. He used a few months to reach his limits.
 After that, he began to comprehend the Grand Unity Aspect.
 In twenty years, Han Jue had cultivated twelve Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols. They were the Nine Yang Fiendcelestial, the Earth Fiendcelestial, the Origin Gold Fiendcelestial, the Ultimate Bone Fiendcelestial, the Thousand-Headed Fiendcelestial, the Falling Space Fiendcelestial, the Cave Eye Fiendcelestial, the Red Evil Fiendcelestial, West Day Fiendcelestial, the Great Dharma Fiendcelestial, Trapped Nightmare Fiendcelestial, and Thought Severing Fiendcelestial.
 Han Jue had already accumulated 35 Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols and was walking further and further on the path of invincibility.
 After that, he began the simulation trial.
 Everyone below the Sages were insta-killed!
 He was still killed when he challenged a Sage, but he lasted longer.
 Han Jue felt bored.
 He seemed to have become stronger, but also not.
 Han Jue decided to set a goal for himself. He wanted to defeat a Heavenly Dao Sage before attaining the Dao!
 If he couldn’t even do this, how could he challenge all the Heavenly Dao Sages alone after he attained the Dao?
 Han Jue adjusted his emotions and took out the Book of Misfortune.
 He smiled.
 As his Dharmic powers were injected into the Book of Misfortune, a black light emitted and shone on Han Jue’s face, making him look extremely evil and terrifying.
 Five days later.
 Han Jue began to curse with his lifespan. His lifespan decreased extremely quickly. As expected of a Heavenly Dao Numinous Treasure. If it were an ordinary cultivator, they might be drained dry in a second.
 On the other side.
 Sage Fated Secrets sensed the Dark Forbidden Lord’s curse and immediately circulated his energy to resist.
 He had a feeling that this curse was stronger than before!
 At this moment, he was in Emperor Xiao’s Dao Field.
 Emperor Xiao frowned when he saw Sage Fated Secrets circulating his energy. He asked, “The Dark Forbidden Lord has begun?”
 Sage Fated Secrets nodded.
 Emperor Xiao pinched his fingers to deduce but couldn’t track the source of the curse on Sage Fated Secrets.
 I knew it!
 This Dark Forbidden Lord is really a Sage!
 Emperor Xiao’s expression darkened. A Sage who wanted to destroy other Sages was extremely dangerous. Even if Emperor Xiao had ulterior motives, he did not want to be secretly targeted by other Sages.
 Look at Sage Fated Secrets, he had even developed a mental demon.
 After a while.
 Black Qi began to surround Sage Fated Secrets. This was the manifestation of the curse.
 Emperor Xiao sensed with his divine sense and was secretly shocked.
 Could it be that the other party had sacrificed a world?
 The curse was too powerful!
 Sage Fated Secrets took out a golden bell and covered himself. However, the curse power directly penetrated the golden bell and attacked his body and soul.
 “Oh no!”
 Sage Fated Secrets cursed silently. This curse power had increased too quickly!
 This time, it was probably not as simple as a mental demon!
 He opened his eyes and said, “Emperor, help me!”
 Emperor Xiao immediately appeared behind him. His right palm landed on his shoulder, and he used his great Dharmic powers to help Sage Fated Secrets resist the curse.
 In the Daoist temple, covered in a black aura, Han Jue cursed as he stared at the attributes panel.
 10 trillion years!
 15 trillion years!
 20 trillion years!
 (Because of your curse, your enemy Sage Fated Secrets has developed mental demons. Fortunately, with the help of a Sage, he suppressed these mental demons.]
