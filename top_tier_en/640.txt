 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du also stared at her. Empress Houtu had a complicated expression as she said faintly, “He said that the Chaotic Calamity before the creation of the world is about to make a comeback. At that time, it will be even more terrifying than the Three Thousand Chaotic Fiendcelestial Era he was in.”
 The Universal Hall was silent.
 Three Thousand Chaotic Fiendcelestial Era! The Sages felt a chill.
 The current Chaos also had the existence of Chaotic Fiendcelestials.
 These Chaotic Fiendcelestials were all supreme existences that surpassed the three thousand laws and were unrestrained However, there was only a number of Chaotic Fiendcelestials. They were all tenacious existences who had survived the Fiendcelestial Era.
 Did Empress Houtu mean that these Chaotic Fiendcelestials were about to trigger the Chaotic Calamity?
 Chaotic Calamity… Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity! The Sages thought of the words left behind by the Dao Ancestor before he vanished and felt even more terrified.
 Their ability could only protect the Heavenly Dao. If the Great Dao Calamity affected the Heavenly Dao, could they withstand it? “I need the Jade Slip of Creation. Senior, please help me find it!” Fang Liang suddenly said.
 His expression was solemn. The Jade Slip of Creation was a Supreme Treasure used by the Dao Ancestor to attain the Dao. It was comparable to the Giant God Pangu’s Heaven-Opening Axe!
 The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate asked, “What for?”
 Fang Liang said in a low voice, “Let the Heavenly Dao break through and expand to devour the Chaos, thereby stopping the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity.
 When the Dao Ancestor chose me, he mentioned the Ancient Desolate. He said that there was an extremely terrifying power hidden in the Ancient Desolate.
 The reason why he disappeared was to find a way to resist that power.
 For this, the Dao Ancestor did not hesitate to transform into billions of Dharma Idols and walk through the Chaos.” He was one of them! “Now that the seal of the Ancient Desolate is about to be broken, the terrifying existence that the Dao Ancestor is wary of can come out at any time. At that time, not only the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End, but the Heavenly Dao will also die!”
 The Sages were all shocked. Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du asked in a low voice, “Is that true?”
 Fang Liang said, “I, Fang Liang, swear to the Heavenly Dao that if I lie to you, the providence of the Heavenly Dao will dissipate on its own.” The Sages did not say a word and fell into deep thought. This conversation shocked them.
 They realized that things were not as simple as they had imagined. Other than resisting the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End, they had to be wary of existences of a higher level.
 In the depths of the chaos, a ball of black aura was surging and gradually becoming larger. The black aura gradually turned into black flames, and a pair of bright red eyes suddenly opened in the fire heart.
 “Who am I…”
 “Han Jue… Misfortune… Dark Forbidden Lord…”
 The black flames emitted a hoarse voice. Hearing it carefully, it was actually somewhat similar to Han Jue’s voice.
 The black flames produced a powerful suction force, stirring up a strong wind and forming a huge vortex. Chaotic Qi from all directions surged into the black flames. As time passed, the black flames grew larger and larger.
 After an unknown period of time, when the black flames were larger than a world, a figure flew over.
 It was a green-robed Daoist. He stood on a wooden sword with his hands behind his back. The green-robed Daoist suddenly stopped and looked at the black flames.
 “What a strong aura of misfortune… Misfortune is invisible and colorless. Why is it condensing here?”?the green-robed Daoist muttered to himself. Raising his right hand to deduce, his face suddenly turned pale.
 The distant black flames suddenly rushed towards the green-robed Daoist at an extremely fast speed. The green-robed Daoist glared as his robes fluttered. A terrifying aura blocked the black flames, causing his speed to decrease.
 “Hmph! Who cares what you are? Since you’re an evil creature, I’ll kill you!” The green-robed Daoist smiled disdainfully.
 Countless vines grew from the wooden sword under his feet and quickly surrounded the black flames. Flowers of different colors grew from the vines.
 Ten thousand flowers bloomed at the same time. Beams of light shot out from the pistil, piercing through the black flames and causing them to be riddled with holes.
 The black flames roared venomously.
 The green-robed Daoist frowned in thought. The black flames suddenly exploded, turning into a black mist that filled the air. Then, it shrank towards the green-robed Daoist at a greater speed.
 The green-robed Daoist waved his hand, and Dharmic powers erupted. It was as if the sun had exploded.
 The scorching Dharmic powers caused the Chaotic Space to boil, but the black mist swept past his Dharmic powers and quickly drowned him.
 In the black mist, the green-robed Daoist panicked. “What’s going on? What power is this? It can actually imprison space!” The green-robed Daoist kept casting spells as he roared in his heart.
𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com A strange sneer came from all directions as if thousands of ghosts were laughing at him. The situation was terrifying.
 Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 732 years had passed since Han Jue finished cursing He was cultivating when lines of words suddenly appeared in front of him.
 [Detected that you caused the birth of the Curse Fiendcelestial. Because the Curse Fiendcelestial is filled with hatred and jealousy towards you, you have the following choices:]
 [1: Go to the depths of the Chaos immediately and kill the Curse Fiendcelestial to prevent future trouble. You can obtain a Great Dao fragment, a Mystical Power inheritance, and a Creation Spirit Stone.)
 [2: Cultivate in a low-profile manner and stay away from the Curse Fiendcelestial. You can obtain a Great Dao fragment and a Heavenly Dao Spirit Stone.)
 Han Jue was stunned.
 Curse Fiendcelestial?
 What the hell?
 Could it be because he had cursed too many times? Han Jue didn’t make a choice immediately and cautiously used the derivation function. “I want to know how the Book of Misfortune is related to the Curse Fiendcelestial?”
 (100 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [The power of the Book of Misfortune has touched upon a certain Transcendent Rule. The Curse Fiendcelestial itself is the grudge of the Primordial Chaotic Fiendcelestial. It was born because of the fluctuations of the Transcendent Rule. Its mission is to capture you, kill you, and replace you. The Curse Fiendcelestial cannot find you through the Book of Misfortune.)
 So ridiculous!
 “What is the Transcendent Rule?”
 [It involves karma that surpasses the current limits of the system. It cannot be deduced.] Han Jue remained silent. He asked, “Can the Curse Fiendcelestial enter the Heavenly Dao?”
 [Not for the time being, unless he becomes a Heavenly Dao lifeform.]
 The second question did not deduct his lifespan. Han Jue asked again, “Can I use the Book of Misfortune to kill him?”
 (100 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [The Book of Misfortune can’t kill the Curse Fiendcelestial. It can only provide the Curse Fiendcelestial with a stronger power.)
 So perverted!
 Han Jue was shocked. “Can the Curse Fiendcelestial kill me now?”
 [Not for the time being.)
 Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief. It seemed that the Curse Fiendcelestial had yet to become powerful. It was just that its identity was special and was only worth a hundred billion years.
 He couldn’t use the Book of Misfortune to curse the Curse Fiendcelestial, and Han Jue couldn’t leave the Heavenly Dao. He could only wait for it to attack.
 Han Jue took out the Book of Misfortune with a complicated expression. “Transcendent Rule… There are rules higher than the Great Dao?” Han Jue thought silently. He thought of the future that had developed.
 Could the supreme power that the Heavenly Dao and the Heavenly Court faced be related to this kind of Transcendent Rule?
 Suddenly thinking of something, Han Jue asked again, “How long will it take for the Curse Fiendcelestial to attack the Heavenly Dao and find trouble with me?”
 (100 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [According to his speed of becoming stronger, it will take him about three billion years to forcefully enter the Heavenly Dao.]
