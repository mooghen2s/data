 Should he accept them or not?
 Han Jue didn’t forget that Li Xuan’ao had dug out the Chaotic Heavenly Dog’s eyes.
 After thinking, Han Jue shook his head and said, “It’s not easy to accept you guys. Firstly, I’m not sure if you’ll cultivate in peace after joining the Hidden Sect and not cause trouble everywhere. Secondly, your junior dug out my disciple’s eyes and forcefully snatched his providence.”
 Li Daokong was stunned. Li Xuan’ao’s expression changed.
 Li Daokong glanced at Li Xuan’ao and knew what was going on when he saw his expression.
 At this moment!
 Li Daokong suddenly reached out and dug out Li Xuan’ao’s eyes. It was so fast that Li Xuan’ao didn’t even have time to react.
 Li Daokong squeezed his right hand and turned his eyes into dust. He stared at Han Jue and said, “I don’t care if it’s true or not. I’ll make him repay the debt, but we both know that both your disciple and my junior can regrow their eyes. You’ve already seen my sincerity.
 “If you’re willing to accept us, we’ll listen to you as long as it doesn’t go against our bottom line. As for that disciple, I can let my junior teach him a Mystical Power as an apology.”
 Li Daokong stared at Han Jue as he spoke.
 Although Li Xuan’ao was angry, he didn’t say anything. He only covered his eyes as blood flowed down his fingertips.
 Han Jue remained silent.
 Li Daokong was really ruthless!
 This made Han Jue speechless. After all, he had indeed invited him before.
 Han Jue said, “After entering my Hidden Sect, other than my instructions, you are not allowed to leave without permission. Usually, I don’t need you to do anything. I can still provide you with the Dao Lecture and Dao Field. You should be able to sense the Spirit Qi and Connate Qi of the Hundred Peak Immortal River, so are you willing?” Li Xuan’ao couldn’t help but ask, “My senior is a Pseudo-Sage. Can you preach the Dao to a Pseudo-Sage?”
F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com “Of course.”
 “Then, what identity will we have?”
 “Let’s see how you perform first. We’ll arrange it in the future.”
 Han Jue wanted to prove the Hidden Sect’s foundation. It was definitely not unreasonable for the two of them to be disciples now.
 Han Jue called for Dian Wei, Shi Dudao’s replica. He was stronger than Li Daokong.
 Li Daokong said, “Alright, we also want to avoid being targeted by the Sages.”
 Han Jue said, “Yes, go down. Someone will bring you outside.”
 Li Daokong nodded and left with Li Xuan’ao.
 After walking out of the Daoist temple, Li Daokong was stunned upon seeing Dian Wei.
 “Why is it you?” Li Daokong frowned.
 Li Xuan’ao was puzzled. Who was this?
 Although he couldn’t see, he still had his divine sense. His eyes were not important.
 Dian Wei said indifferently, “I’m Dian Wei, a guard of the Hundred Peak Immortal River. Please follow me. I’ll bring you around first.”
 Guard?
 Li Daokong was shocked.
 When would Shi Dudao come to the Hidden Sect to be a guard?
 Li Daokong was shocked. Although Li Xuan’ao didn’t know Shi Dudao, he clearly felt that Dian Wei was very strong. He might even be stronger than his senior brother!
 Dian Wei brought them around and deliberately stopped at the Fusang Tree.
 The disciples were all very curious about Li Daokong and his junior brother.
 Long Hao clicked his tongue in wonder. “Even the twins of the Human School are here. The Hidden Sect is becoming stronger.”
 The Chaotic Heavenly Dog nearly peed its pants when it saw Li Xuan’ao. However, it noticed that his eyes were bleeding and his eyelids had clearly sunken. It immediately thought of the truth and worshiped Han Jue.
 Master must have avenged me!
 Li Xuan’ao also noticed the Chaotic Heavenly Dog and was enlightened. He said bitterly, “If you have such a powerful master, why didn’t you say so back then?”
 The Chaotic Heavenly Dog fell silent.
 It didn’t know that its master was so powerful.
 Li Daokong said, “I apologize on my junior’s behalf. I’ll let him teach you a Mystical Power later. I hope that the grudge will be settled.”
 The Chaotic Heavenly Dog was extremely nervous from his stare. It hurriedly nodded in agreement.
 The Black Hell Chicken was furious. “You’re so useless. Can you be more firm?”
 The Chaotic Heavenly Dog nodded like a chicken pecking at rice.
 Li Daokong did not say much. He also had his own pride. It was their fault, so he could admit it, but he wouldn’t lower his head so easily.
 That day, the two of them established a Daoist temple in the forest. It wasn’t far from the hundreds of thousands of other in-name disciples.
 Han Jue would pay attention to this pair of fellow disciples at first, afraid that they would act recklessly. As time passed and the two of them did not cause trouble, he was relieved.
 In a hall outside the 33rd Heaven.
 Li Muyi’s expression darkened. Several figures gathered in the hall, including Jiang Dugu.
 “What? Li Daokong and Li Xuan’ao betrayed
 us?”
 “Ridiculous! We have to capture them!”
 “When has a traitor appeared in our Human School?”
 “Where are they?”
 “Li Daokong is too arrogant! He didn’t respect us seniors before!”
 The Human School’s mighty figures cursed angrily. Jiang Dugu did not say a word. His expression darkened, but a hint of joy flashed across his eyes.
 He was still worrying about how to deal with Li Daokong when he betrayed the sect!
 Li Muyi said, “The two of them went to the Hidden Sect. Who’s going?”
 A man in a Daoist robe immediately stood up and said, “Senior, let me go. I’ve been in seclusion for 70 million years. It’s time for me to exercise.”
 Seeing him stand out, the others tacitly agreed and did not fight.
 “Dan Long, don’t start fighting directly when you get there. Ask first,” Li Muyi instructed.
 Dan Long nodded, cupped his hands, and bowed. Then, he turned around and left.
 It had been 130 years since Li Daokong and Li Xuan’ao came to seek refuge.
 On this day, Han Jue walked out of the Daoist temple.
 “Everyone, prepare to listen to the lecture!”
 With that said, the entire Hundred Peak Immortal River boiled over. The disciples rushed to the location of the lecture. The Connate lifeforms also began to prepare to listen.
 Li Daokong and Li Xuan’ao followed the disciples to the land of preaching.
 They were very curious about what Han Jue would say.
 After everyone sat down, Han Jue sat on the peak of the mountain and started to preach.
 He was talking about the Great Dao of Extreme Origin!
 He planned to bring Li Daokong and Li Xuan’ao into his Great Dao as well.
 As the lecture began, Li Daokong did not feel amazed at first. Li Xuan’ao even felt disdain. After all, they had heard the Sages preach more than once.
 However, as time passed, the two of them were quickly shocked.
 Han Jue was actually preaching the Great Dao!
 He was even more unfathomable and profound than their master, Li Muyi.
 Most importantly, they could understand it and quickly entered a state of Dao comprehension.
 “He’s a Sage!”
 A storm brewed in their hearts, especially Li Xuan’ao. His eyes that had just grown revealed disbelief.
 (Li Xuan’ao has a favorable impression of you. Current favorability: 4 stars]
 Han Jue saw this notification and didn’t care. He continued to preach.
 Compared to Li Xuan’ao, he cared more about Li Daokong
 He might become a prominent figure of the Hidden Sect in the future. Although Dao Sovereign, Zhao Xuanyuan, Jiang Yi, Zhou Fan, and Li Yao’s potential were unparalleled, compared to Li Daokong, they lacked an arrogant domineering aura!
 An invincible aura!
