 roots.”
 Han Jue, who was observing the Immortal World, sighed and smiled. Every time he entered seclusion for a thousand years, he would look at the Immortal World. Li Daokong’s care for the humans comforted him.
 However, what really satisfied him was the actions of the Sages. They were all thinking of ways to increase the strength of the Heavenly Dao. At this moment, the Sages no longer cared about the conflict between sects. They preached the Dao to all living beings and did not force them to enter their sects.
 With them managing the Heavenly Dao and making it stronger, Han Jue could cultivate in peace.
 His gaze landed on Han Yu. This fellow was helping the Human Race. His status in the Human Race was now second only to the Human Emperor. Even the Human Emperor was polite to him. Han Yu, who had traveled the world alone, finally settled down. He also married and had children in the Human Race.
 Han Jue didn’t care about Han Yu’s children. Their bloodline was too far apart. The reason why he liked Han Yu was that he looked like him.
 To be honest, he didn’t have much feelings for Han Yu.
 It was worth mentioning that Long Hao actually started hanging out with Han Yu because of his appearance. “This brat isn’t controlling the Dragon Race. What’s he doing there?” Han Jue muttered to himself. He didn’t want to warn him. If Long Hao went against his will, he would just expel him from the sect in the future.
 In any case, the Evil Heavenly Emperor didn’t care about his youngest son. Han Jue closed his eyes again and entered cultivation.
 Time passed quickly in the peaceful Immortal World.
 Ten thousand years passed like a dream. Han Jue was finally close to breaking through to the mid-stage of the Freedom Primordial Chaos Realm.
 He hadn’t broken through for nearly thirty thousand years. He was really not used to it. His potential was still lacking. Han Jue sighed secretly. Of course, he was just joking. His breakthrough speed could revive the dead Pangu out of anger. Han Jue opened the emails to check. The Immortal World was too peaceful, causing him to almost relax. He had to look at his friends to calm down.
 (Your good friend Evil Heavenly Emperor was attacked by a mysterious Dao Devil] x8920312
 (Your son Han Tuo was attacked by an Inauspicious Evil) x44032
 (Your disciple Zhou Fan obtained the Dao in your enemy’s Seven Dao Sage’s dream. His cultivation has increased greatly.) (Your good friend Shi Dudao was attacked by your good friend Li Daokong] x3 (Your disciple Su Qi has absorbed the providence of reincarnation and stepped into the Pseudo-Sage Realm.]
 (Your good friend Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du was cursed by a mysterious curse.] (Your good friend Ancestor Xitian has comprehended the Great Dao and created a world.]
 The last time he read the emails was two thousand years ago. During this period of time, the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End was still very lively. Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du’s curse attracted Han Jue’s attention.
 He hoped that it was not a curse within the Heavenly Dao.
 Below, he saw Ancestor Xitian splitting open the world.
 Han Jue frowned. After Ancestor Xitian created the world, his stance might change. Just like Li Muyi from before, he began to focus on his Little Heavenly Dao. However, Ancestor Xitian had yet to return. He couldn’t affect the Heavenly Dao for the time being. Ancestor Xitian was the strongest existence in the Heavenly Dao. Other existences at his realm couldn’t enter the Heavenly Dao, while Ancestor Xitian lived outside the 33rd Heaven all year round. He was equivalent to a Heavenly Dao Sage. As he read, all sorts of opportunities and breakthroughs dazzled his eyes. From the emails, it could be seen that the Immortal World had begun to bloom. It had welcomed the most dazzling era in history. In the past, during peaceful times, Sages did not appear. In the past, when Sages appeared, a calamity descended. A mighty figure of the Chan School declared that this was the Heavenly Dao Era. All living beings focused on developing the Heavenly Dao, indicating that the goal of all living beings in the Heavenly Dao had shifted from internal strife to expanding the Heavenly Dao. In the Heavenly Dao Era, Sages occupied a lot of space. However, under the intentions of the other Sages, the Immeasurable Merit Divine Might Heavenly Sage was worshiped by all living beings. Statues of the Immeasurable Merit Divine Might Heavenly Sage were erected in the myriad worlds, bringing Han Jue a huge amount of faith and transforming it into providence. Regarding this, Han Jue didn’t absorb the providence. Instead, he suppressed it in the Primordial World and kept it for future use. He didn’t want to fuse with the Heavenly Dao. If the Heavenly Dao really couldn’t block the attack one day and was destroyed, Han Jue would definitely escape. After reading the emails, Han Jue began to deduce who was cursing Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du. [160 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?] So much!
 It had to be a Great Dao Sage!
 Continue!
 A figure appeared in Han Jue’s mind and in front of him was: (Cundi: Great Dao Sage, Immeasurable Emperor, founder of the Buddhist Sect. Because you severed his karma with Qiu Xilai, he has developed hatred towards you. Current Hatred Points: 6 stars]
 This fellow!
 Han Jue raised his eyebrows. He was about to sharpen his blade.
 After the Chaotic Deity pretended to die, the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End was in chaos and the Heavenly Dao was not disturbed for the time being. Therefore, Han Jue didn’t continue cursing. However, Cundi attacked Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du at this moment. He had to suppress him. He could even use this opportunity to mislead Cundi into thinking that the Dark Forbidden Lord was Laozi of the Human School.
 The more Han Jue thought about it, the more he felt that it was feasible.
 He wasn’t afraid of causing trouble for him. After all, Laozi was the First Disciple of the Dao Ancestor and his strength was unfathomable. He took out the Book of Misfortune and started cursing Cundi. Five days later, his lifespan decreased rapidly. Of course, compared to his overall lifespan, it decreased like a turtle crawling.
 Deity Realm of the Ruins of End, Thunderclap Monastery.
 Cundi found Jie Yin and said in a low voice, “The Dark Forbidden Lord is cursing me again!” Jie Yin frowned and let him meditate and circulate his energy.
 “Is he testing us, or is he going to kill us?” Jie Yin asked.
𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m The Dark Forbidden Lord had the strength to curse the Chaotic Deity to death. If he was really targeting him, Cundi would definitely suffer. It was precisely because the Dark Forbidden Lord was too powerful that Jie Yin believed that he didn’t come from the Heavenly Dao but from the depths of the Chaos. He warned Cundi not to provoke the Dark Forbidden Lord again.
 “I’m not sure…” Cundi said with a dark expression.
 He looked angry, but he was extremely panicked inside.
 Even the Chaotic Deity couldn’t stop him, let alone him!
 Jie Yin asked, “Why did he suddenly start cursing you? Did you do something?” Facing Jie Yin, Cundi did not hide anything. After knowing the reason, Jie Yin cursed him. “Why are you cursing Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du? Not to mention the Dark Forbidden Lord, who can you provoke? Although Laozi’s been in seclusion, Xuan Du is his only personal disciple. He will definitely protect him.”
 Cundi was extremely aggrieved. He gritted his teeth and said, “Could the Dark Forbidden Lord be Laozi? The reason why I suspected it was Han Jue previously was that he was ruining our plan. However, Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du’s betrayal means that the Human School is suspicious. Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du had just descended to the Heavenly Dao and became friends with Han Jue. I even suspect that Han Jue is supported by the Human School! The new Sage of the Human School of the Heavenly Dao has also joined Han Jue. Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du doesn’t mind at all!”
 Jie Yin said faintly, “So what if he is? Don’t you understand? The point is not who the Dark Forbidden Lord is, but that he can kill us.”
 Cundi was silent.
 Jie Yin sighed. “Ever since you left the Heavenly Dao, your Dao heart has inflated and you’ve lost your previous vigilance.” Cundi said indignantly, “Then, what should we do now? He’s still cursing me!”
 Jie Yin stood up. “I’ll go find Laozi. If he really wants to curse you to death, I can’t help you.”
