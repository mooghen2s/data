 “The humans are in danger,” Han Jue said calmly, causing Zhao Xuanyuan’s expression to turn ugly.
 Although he had left the Human Race and hid in the Hidden Sect, he still cared about the humans.
 Zhao Xuanyuan muttered, “Could it be that even Sage Fuxi can’t save the humans?”
 Han Jue didn’t reply. He believed that Zhao Xuanyuan could convince himself. After all, this fellow had come here because he was afraid of death.
 At this moment, if he used the Supreme Treasure to force Zhao Xuanyuan out, this fellow probably would not agree.
 The two of them chatted for a while more before Zhao Xuanyuan left.
 In a few months, someone visited Han Jue again.
 This time, it was Murong Qi. He was also feeling uneasy. Han Jue thought for a moment and walked out of the Connate Cave Abode to gather all the disciples.
 “In at most a thousand years, the Immeasurable Calamity will end. No matter who wins or loses, countless living beings will be buried with them. Your current state of mind is being affected by the karma of the Heavenly Dao. You shouldn’t want to enter the calamity, right?”
 Han Jue went straight to the point. Hearing this, everyone shook their heads.
 The Chaotic Heavenly Dog said, “In any case, I don’t want to go out. I’ll stay here from now on.”
 The others followed suit.
 “This Immeasurable Calamity is a little fast!”
 “It’s indeed fast. The previous calamities lasted for tens of thousands of years or even millions of years.”
 “Millions of years? That terrifying?”
 “Legend has it that a long time ago, the Immortal World was countless times larger than now. There were countless living beings. Any mortal stone could turn into a living being.”
 “It’s finally over. After it’s over, can we go back?”
 Hearing the disciples’ words, Han Jue smiled and said, “If there’s no danger after the calamity, the Dao Field will move back to the Immortal World. However, you still have to cultivate diligently when you get there.”
 After the calamity ended, Sages could no longer enter the Immortal World and would be expelled by the Heavenly Dao.
 Han Jue didn’t have many enemies, to begin with. In fact, his actual identity had even fewer enemies. He was naturally not afraid to return to the Immortal World.
 It was still too early for Han Jue’s world of stars to transform into the Heavenly Dao World. Who knew how many years it would take?
 As for the Reroll World, Han Jue did not plan to let it out. In the future, he wanted it to guide his Heavenly Dao World to develop.
 The current Reroll World had already become a world of its own. Just like the Earth in his previous life, there was no such thing as ascension.
 During peaceful times, the Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal was a top existence in the Immortal World. As long as Han Jue did not cause trouble and occupied an area, it was definitely not difficult.
 It was also a good opportunity to develop the Hidden Sect and deal with the next Immeasurable Calamity.
 Regarding the Hidden Sect, Han Jue’s plan was not to fight for hegemony, but to accumulate strength and gather like-minded cultivators to pursue the Great Dao together.
 If he wanted to do something in the future, he could let his disciples do it.
 The Hidden Sect would take the elite path!
 “Master, where’s Yang Tiandong? When are you summoning him back?” The Chaotic Heavenly Dog asked.
 After all, they had been close and were beaten together. The dog couldn’t forget his company.
 Han Jue said, “When the time comes, he will naturally return.”
 Yang Tiandong had temporarily escaped the cycle of reincarnation and was in the human camp fighting against the immortals. His cultivation level was not high and he was considered cannon fodder.
 After comforting everyone, Han Jue returned to the Connate Cave Abode.
 No matter when the calamity ended, Han Jue had to hurry up and cultivate.
 Without absolute strength, he did not dare to return to the Immortal World.
 In a cave.
 Long Hao was meditating on a huge rock to heal his injuries. His complexion was very bad. It was obvious that he had just been severely injured.
 Suddenly, the mountain shook violently. Countless rocks fell and turned into dust and were about to hit him.
 Long Hao opened his eyes and looked out of the cave. Two figures as big as mountains were fighting outside.
 On one side was a giant covered in scales and holding a huge axe.
 On the other side was a huge bird with a body like a roc and a head like a tiger or leopard. Its sharp claws were shiny and cold as if they were cast from iron.
 Long Hao frowned and muttered, “Have these guys lost their minds?”
 A soul shadow flew out from his body. It was Hao Tian.
 Hao Tian’s expression was solemn as he said, “I didn’t expect the Immeasurable Calamity to progress so quickly. It seems that a Sage slaughtered living beings, causing negative karma to reach the limit that the Heavenly Dao can bear. Now that the Heavenly Dao’s Dharmic powers and negative karma have invaded the Dao hearts of all living beings, the great elimination is about to begin.”
 Long Hao felt a headache. “Then, what should I do? I feel that we can’t cause trouble anymore. It’s good enough to live.”
 Previously, he had joined the Heavenly Court and fought for it. The Dragon Court that had been the first was suppressed by a Sage and was completely wiped out. Only he had escaped.
 The reason why Sages did not kill him was because of Hao Tian.
 “Nonsense. We can only think of a way to survive now. When a Sage enters the calamity, all our calculations have already turned to smoke. We have no chance of winning anymore.” Hao Tian shook his head.
T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by nov(ê(l)biin.co/m He thought for a moment and said, “The most important thing now is to stabilize your Dao heart. Don’t be driven by negative karma and lose your mind.”
 Long Hao sighed and said in confusion, “Why do I feel that the Sages are cleaning up the living beings under each other? They appear regularly and slaughter people using the name of protecting their forces. The Sages themselves don’t seem to be fighting.”
 The competition had already become a slaughter. Even Long Hao felt his heart palpitate. He was often worried that a Sage would suddenly appear.
 “You’re right. Slaughtering living beings is to worsen the negative karma of the world and advance the calamity. The Sages will also fight. But they’re Sages, after all. No one can kill each other. They’re just putting on a show for the humans and the Heavenly Court,” Hao Tian said very calmly.
 After all, he had also experienced the calamity and could see many things clearly. Still very puzzled, Long Hao asked, “What can the Sages obtain by doing this?”
 Hao Tian shook his head and said, “I don’t know, either.”
 He looked at the terrifying battle outside the cave and frowned.
 Actually, he had a guess, but he didn’t dare to say it.
 If he was right, this Immeasurable Calamity was only the foundation. The true terrifying calamity was still brewing.
 Could it be…
 The legendary Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity?
 Hao Tian was shocked. Terror filled his heart.
 Seventy years passed.
 Perhaps because no one disturbed him, Han Jue felt that the past 70 years had passed very quickly, as if he was cursing Sage Fated Secrets every day. Until one day, Han Jue saw an email.
 (Your disciple Su Qi was suppressed by your enemy Sage Fated Secrets. He was imprisoned in the Buddhist Sect and endless bad luck spread.]
 Sage Fated Secrets suppressed Su Qi?
 He was trying to kill with a borrowed knife!
 Han Jue cursed silently. They were using Su Qi to destroy the Buddhist Sect!
 He immediately took out the Book of Misfortune and started cursing Sage Fated Secrets.
 However, his curse was useless. Sage Fated Secrets was not affected.
 Another thirty years passed.
 Han Jue saw another email and his expression changed.
 (Your disciple Su Qi spread bad luck, causing the providence of the Buddhist Sect to be destroyed. The Divine Buddha Dao Fruit has completely shattered and the Buddhist Sect no longer exists.] The Buddhist Sect was gone?
 Su Qi is so powerful?
 No!
 It was definitely Sage Fated Secrets’ doing!
 Han Jue frowned.
 Su Qi had completely offended Qiu Xilai. It was unknown if Qiu Xilai could see that he was used by other Sages.
 Just as Han Jue was worried.
 [Qiu Xilai wants to visit you in your dreams. Do you want to continue?]
 [Qiu Xilai wants to visit you in your dreams. Do you want to continue?]
 This fellow started spamming again!
