 While cultivating, Han Jue cursed Sage Fated Secrets and checked his emails.
 The content of the emails was still mostly about various opportunities. He was bored.
 It had been a long time since he was “attacked”. Han Jue was really not used to it.
 It seemed that the Immortal World would be peaceful for a long time.
 Han Jue felt that it was good. It gave them time to develop.
 The cultivation levels of the Hidden Sect disciples continued to increase. No one stopped advancing. It had to be said that the Great Dao of Extreme Origin was all-encompassing. It was really wonderful. All the disciples could obtain enlightenment from it.
 Han Jue realized that after reaching the Great Dao level, potential was actually not that important. What was more important was aptitude and comprehension.
 On this day.
 Dao Comprehension Sword came to visit him.
 She was already a Rank Nine Immortal Emperor and was only a step away from the Deity Realm. She hoped that he could help her.
 Han Jue began to preach the Dao for her alone, focusing on the Deity Realm.
 Twenty years later, Dao Comprehension Sword left with much comprehension.
 A hundred and thirty-nine years later, Dao Comprehension Sword successfully reached the One Mystic Divine Origin.
 More and more Deity Realm experts appeared in the Hidden Sect.
 The entire sect was flourishing.
 The Connate lifeforms at the bottom also began to focus on cultivation. The number of Connate lifeforms around the Hundred Peak Immortal River continued to increase. However, ever since Ancient Fiendish Yin had suffered a setback here, no powerful enemies tried to barge in.
 Boom!
 Near the Hundred Peak Immortal River, the ground shook, startling many Connate lifeforms and ferocious beasts.
 Giant fingers broke out from the ground. Soon, the entire palm stood on the ground. It was even larger than a mountain. Its fingertips reached into the clouds.
 This palm was covered in blood. It was dense and ghastly, and the fingers seemed extremely stiff.
 Under the Fusang Tree, Jiang Yi looked at the palm and frowned. He muttered, “I think I’ve seen that hand somewhere before.”
 The Black Hell Chicken said calmly, “Didn’t limbs fall from the sky thousands of years ago? It’s probably a mighty figure plotting. However, we don’t have to worry as long as it doesn’t appear in the Hundred Peak Immortal River.”
 Jiang Yi glanced at it and pretended to be cold.
 All the living beings in the Hundred Peak Immortal River were discussing the palm.
 Inside the Daoist temple.
 Han Jue had a strange expression.
 This palm…
 Zu Tu’s hand!
 Their auras were identical, but even more sinister!
 Could it be that after Zu Tu died, his body was taken away by a Sage?
 Zu Tu was the strongest person in the early stages of the calamity. He had even died because of Han Jue. Now that his palm appeared near the Dao Field, Han Jue was inexplicably nervous.
 “I want to know, why did this palm appear near the Dao Field?” Han Jue thought silently.
 (2 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [Emperor Xiao’s doing]
 Han Jue frowned. It was really him.
 The person who had scattered the limbs around the Immortal World was Emperor
 Xiao.
 This person was one of the Devil Race’s Ancestors. He had the Devil Ancestor’s support and was full of ambition.
 Emperor Xiao noticed Han Jue because they looked at each other.
 Han Jue had a feeling that the devils would definitely appear in the next Immeasurable Calamity and make a comeback.
 Han Jue thought for a moment and decided to ignore it.
 It was just nice for the palm to drive the surrounding living beings away and return peace to the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 Even if Emperor Xiao came personally, he would still not be able to break through the Dao Field’s defense.
 Zu Tu’s palm absorbed endless negative karma and grudges. The aura of misfortune it emitted made the living beings uneasy.
 In a few years, some living beings couldn’t take it anymore and fled.
 This was what Han Jue wanted.
 He extended his divine sense and swept across several regions. He discovered that it was not only the Hundred Peak Immortal River. The limbs of the previous calamity were everywhere. They occupied places with abundant Spirit Qi and dispersed the Connate lifeforms.
 Han Jue finally understood.
 So Emperor Xiao wanted to restrict the development of Connate lifeforms.
 Since it wasn’t only against Han Jue, he didn’t have to care.
 Just like that.
 Another seven hundred years passed.
 A large number of cultivators appeared outside the Hundred Peak Immortal River. These cultivators rushed towards Zu Tu’s palm and set up array formations around it.
 This scene attracted the attention of the Hidden Sect disciples.
 “Jie School disciple.”
 Long Hao recognized the Daoist robes the disciples were wearing and clicked his tongue in wonder.
 The Sect Master of the Jie School had been here before. Why were there so many disciples this time? What did he want?
 The others also stared at the Jie School disciples.
 Han Jue was also watching from the Daoist temple.
 Several days later, the Jie School disciples surrounded Zu Tu’s palm and began to activate the array formation. Arrays rose. Golden chains wrapped around the palm, black flames burned, and strange red Qi seeped into it. Thousands of Jie School disciples kept casting spells.
 A golden wheel appeared in the sky. It seemed to be formed by dozens of golden rings. Mysterious words flickered vaguely, looking magnificent.
 The palm trembled violently as if it was struggling
 Boom
 A strange force suddenly erupted and swept across Jie School disciples.
 Immediately after, the disciples in the front row were petrified and turned into dust.
ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m This scene frightened the other disciples.
 Zu Tu’s palm suddenly clenched into a fist, causing a strong wind to sweep in all directions and to shatter all the surrounding array formations.
 The other disciples seemed to have suffered a heavy blow. They fell and crashed into the mountains and rivers, drying up at a speed visible to the naked eye and turning into dried corpses as their bodies trembled. They wanted to make a sound, but they could not. In the end, they all died. The world fell silent.
 The Hidden Sect disciples were stunned. This palm was so powerful?
 Even Dao Sovereign, a Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal, could not help but frown.
 Han Jue could tell that this palm already had a power close to a Pseudo-Sage. The strongest among these disciples was only an Immortal Emperor. How could they subdue it?
 “Why did Jing Tiangong let them come to die?”
 Han Jue couldn’t figure it out.
 Little did they know that it was not Jing Tiangong who wanted them to die. The entire Jie School was subduing the remnant body parts everywhere. This batch of disciples had their own thoughts, so they rushed over.
 After the Jie School disciples perished, Zu Tu’s palm slowly released. From high up in the sky, it was as if a giant was buried alive.
 This battle frightened the Hidden Sect disciples, but since Han Jue didn’t say anything, they were not worried. However, they felt uneasy every time they saw Zu Tu’s palm.
 Time passed.
 Thirty years later.
 [Detected that you are twenty thousand years old. You have the following choices:]
 (1: Come out immediately and clean up the remains of the calamity. You can obtain immeasurable merit, a Great Dao Fragment, and a Heavenly Dao Spirit Stone.)
 [2: Cultivate in a low-profile manner and not be affected by karma in the world. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment and a Heavenly Dao Spirit Stone.]
 Han Jue suddenly opened his eyes.
 It’s back!
 It’s here!
 Heavenly Dao Spirit Stone!
 As expected of an achievement reward of 20,000 years!
 The Book of Misfortune could be upgraded!
 Han Jue thought happily. He seemed to see Sage Fated Secrets’ death already.
 He chose the second option without hesitation.
 The Book of Misfortune was already a Zenith Heaven Supreme Treasure. If its level rose again, it would definitely be a major one!
 Han Jue immediately took out the Book of Misfortune and the Heavenly Dao Spirit Stone and started to fuse them.
 He wondered if the Dharma treasure would be Pseudo-Sage level. If not, it would directly become a Heavenly Dao Dharma treasure. The power of the curse…
 Han Jue didn’t dare to think too deeply!
