 He emphasized on how to break through to the Zenith Heaven Realm. After all, he was experienced and had ample experience.
 This lecture lasted for ten years. Dao Sovereign left with new comprehension.
 Han Jue looked forward to his breakthrough.
 However, Dao Sovereign was too reckless. He had suffered a setback not long ago and still needed some tempering.
 Jiang Yi was the same. Although Zhao Xuanyuan was cautious, he felt that he couldn’t shoulder the burden. Li Yao was a cultivation maniac and would never leave the Dao Field.
 Murong Qi was better.
 Unfortunately, he was not talented enough.
 Han Jue closed his eyes and continued cultivating.
ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m Two hundred years later.
 Dao Sovereign had successfully reached the Zenith Heaven Realm. Although there was no Heavenly Tribulation, everyone could sense his powerful aura.
 Zenith Heaven Realm!
 A Zenith Heaven finally appeared among the Hidden Sect disciples!
 Five years later.
 Dao Sovereign completely stabilized his cultivation. Han Jue walked out of the cave abode and gathered all the disciples to let Murong Qi hold a banquet.
 This was the first time the Hidden Sect had held a banquet in the ten thousand years it had been established.
 What they ate was not meat, but all sorts of spirit fruits and wine.
 At the banquet, Han Jue mentioned the Zenith Heaven Realm and the development of the Hidden Sect.
 “The Hidden Sect is a hidden sect. I hope that we can maintain our original intentions and prioritize cultivation. Perhaps in the current Immortal World, we are the number one in terms of Immortal Emperors. However, there are too few Deity Realm, Zenith Heaven, and even the higher Pseudo-Sage. It’s difficult for us to compete with the other major factions. I hope that before you reach the Deity Realm, you won’t go out easily. Without reaching the Zenith Heaven Realm, you shouldn’t provoke powerful enemies.
 “When the Dao Ancestor appeared, he was already invincible. We walk the path of the Dao Ancestor, and we have always cultivated diligently. When he was born, there were no longer any powerful enemies.”
 Han Jue shook his wine cup and said casually.
 Everyone couldn’t help but look at Dao Sovereign, who couldn’t help but feel ashamed.
 The matter of him challenging Jiang Dugu had already spread through the Hidden Sect through Jiang Yi’s mouth.
 Although he was ashamed, Dao Sovereign becoming a Zenith Heaven was indeed admirable. After Han Jue finished speaking, he became the banquet’s protagonist.
 Everyone asked him how it felt to become a Zenith Heaven cultivator.
 The banquet lasted for a few days.
 Han Jue returned to the Daoist temple and continued cultivating.
 Bored, he asked in his mind, “How long until the next calamity?”
 [Ten billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 Ten billion years was nothing to Han Jue.
 [If the Heavenly Dao doesn’t change, it will take 4.9 billion years to welcome the next calamity.)
 4.9 billion years?
 So long!
 At that time, I will definitely be invincible under the Heavenly Dao!
 Han Jue couldn’t help but be pleasantly surprised.
 However, he didn’t believe it blindly. After all, there was a prerequisite.
 If he angered a Sage, it would definitely change the course of the Heavenly Dao.
 No matter what, a hundred million years should be possible.
 He was still confident that he could become a Sage in 100 million years.
 The Immortal World was timeless, especially in cultivation.
 Year after year passed.
 Another thousand years passed.
 Han Jue was finally close to the mid-stage of the Pseudo-Sage Realm.
 It had been four thousand years since his last breakthrough
 It was really difficult to cultivate to the Pseudo-Sage Realm.
 Han Jue predicted that he would break through in at most a hundred years.
 There were more and more Connate lifeforms in the Hundred Peak Immortal River. There were already more than a thousand of them. Han Zuitian had already established a good relationship with each Connate lifeform. It wouldn’t be difficult for him to subdue them in the future.
 The Nether Race members were usually very quiet. They had already developed bitter cultivation and gentle temperament.
 Han Jue began to worry.
 Ten thousand Immortal Emperors would be the backbone of the Hidden Sect.
 However, he was still wary of the Nether Race. He was worried that Empress Houtu would suddenly take them back.
 Han Jue suddenly had a bold thought.
 Should he use Absolute Purification on every Nether Race member?
 Han Jue called the clan leader Han You over and purified him first, consuming a hundred million years of his lifespan.
 Not much.
 An Immortal Emperor was only worth a hundred million years.
 After the purification was successful, Han You gathered the Nether Race members in a valley. Han Jue appeared and preached the Dao to them while purifying them.
 This process lasted for nearly a hundred years. Han Jue finally purified the entire Nether Race.
 The Nether Race members didn’t know that they would be purified and were all very touched. Han Jue actually preached to them for a hundred years alone. How could they not remember this favor?
 Han Jue was killing two birds with one stone. Not only did he rope in people, but he also made himself feel at ease.
 He had only spent a trillion years, which was not even enough to curse a Sage into developing a mental demon.
 After returning to the Daoist temple, Han Jue started cultivating.
 (Empress Houtu sent you a dream. Do you accept?]
 Eh?
 So timely?
 It seemed that Empress Houtu could really sense the Nether Race.
 Han Jue hesitated for a moment and chose to accept it.
 After entering the dream, he came to the side of the Yellow Spring. Empress Houtu stood not far away and stared at him quietly.
 Han Jue bowed and asked, “Empress Houtu, are you looking for me?”
 Empress Houtu asked, “How’s the situation of the Nether Race?”
 Han Jue replied, “Not bad. They’re cultivating in seclusion with me. Don’t worry, I treat them like my own. I won’t mistreat them.”
 He played dumb. Empress Houtu was definitely asking about Absolute Purification.
 Empress Houtu smiled and said, “Then, I’m relieved. I can sense that they have already broken through to the Emperor Realm? How did you nurture them? That’s quite impressive.”
 Han Jue sighed and said, “I gave them all my natural treasures.”
 Empress Houtu was silent.
 Han Jue probed, “Empress wants to take them back?”
 Empress Houtu shook her head and said, “How can that be? I’ve already entrusted them to you. How can I take them back after they mature?”
 As long as you know that!
 Empress Houtu said, “Your disciple, Yang Tiandong, died in the Dao Destruction Mystical Power. However, his soul was protected by a Sage. His soul has already come to me. When the order of reincarnation is restored, I will let him reincarnate.”
 Han Jue thanked her, “Thank you, Empress.”
 Empress Houtu asked, “What’s your cultivation level now?”
 Han Jue hesitated for a moment and said, “Early-stage Zenith Heaven.”
 Empress Houtu praised, “Your potential is truly impressive.”
 The two of them chatted for a while more.
 Han Jue’s consciousness returned to reality. He asked in his mind, “Does Empress Houtu want to take back the Nether Race?”
 (3 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [Indeed.]
 Han Jue sighed.
 It was all about benefits.
 However, Han Jue wouldn’t release the Nether Race. He had worked with Empress Houtu before. He had sacrificed so much, so how could he easily hand over the Nether Race?
 Back then, Empress Houtu couldn’t protect the Magus Race, so she handed Tu Ling’er, Diamond Rage, and the Nether Race to Han Jue. Her request was only that Han Jue could protect them. He had already done well.
 When he nurtured the Nether Race to the Zenith Heaven Realm, Empress Houtu wouldn’t be able to take them in even if she wanted to.
 The Nether Race wasn’t stupid. The kindness of nurturing and teaching was greater than the kindness of creation!
 Han Jue abandoned his distracting thoughts and started cultivating to break through to the mid-stage of the Pseudo-Sage Realm.
 Fifty years later.
 Han Jue had a chance to break through.
 He was about to break through.
 [Qiu Xilai wants to visit you in your dreams. Do you accept?]
 (Qiu Xilai wants to visit you in your dreams. Do you accept?]
 (Qiu Xilai wants to visit you in your dreams. Do you accept?]
 This lunatic was spamming again!
 Han Jue almost exploded in anger. Why did he choose this time?
