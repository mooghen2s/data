 The old Daoist smiled and said, “It would naturally be better if you are willing to treat me to a meal. I travel the world and care about the myriad beings. I have answered the questions of many people, including the Human King.”
 The Human Race was extremely adaptive. Less than thirty thousand years after the calamity ended, the Human Race had inherited the prosperous rules of the previous Human Race. They had even established the Human King
 Seeing the prosperity of this city, Han Jue thought that he had transmigrated. This was not the ancient era when the Heavenly Dao restarted.
 Han Jue smiled and asked, “Then, can you see through my thoughts?”.
 The old Daoist shook his head. “How can we easily see through the heart of a person? Even immortals and gods are afraid of the human heart.”
 Previously bored, Han Jue became interested. He smiled and said, “Then, are you an immortal?”
 “I am but a wandering cultivator.”
 “Then, what do you know about existences higher than immortals?”
 “They’re naturally Sages and Heavenly Beings.”
 Han Jue began to chat with the old Daoist. Soon, the food and drinks were served. The old Daoist began to wolf down his food as if he had not eaten in several lifetimes.
 A Grand Unity Golden Immortal was actually so hungry. It was obvious that he was pretending
 This fellow probably wanted Han Jue to look down on him and then slap his face later.
 What was this?
 Pretending to be weak?
 Han Jue found it funny but didn’t expose him.
 He couldn’t be taught by a Grand Unity Golden Immortal if he wanted to attain the Dao. He would just treat it as an interesting incident.
 Two hours later.
 The old Daoist stood up and smiled. “Little friend, you have an unparalleled appearance. I don’t know how many hearts you will capture. Perhaps your confusion is the word love. If you have no regrets and don’t let others down, you will eventually be open-minded.”
 Looking at him disappear into the staircase, Han Jue shook his head and laughed.
 Fraud!
 Han Jue smiled and seemed to have thought of something. He looked out of the window and continued thinking.
 Perhaps what he lacked was true experience.
 “Perhaps I can stay here and be a mortal for a lifetime.”
 Han Jue thought silently.
 With an idea, he stood up and walked out of the inn.
 He first bought a courtyard in the city and added furniture and servants. From then on, he lived in this city. His name was still Han Jue.
 There were countless Han Jue in the world.
 His name had yet to shake the Immortal World. He wasn’t afraid of attracting trouble.
 Spring passed and autumn came.
 Han Jue stayed in the city for ten years.
 This city was called the Eastern Guard. It was one of the cities at the edge of the Human Race. Occasionally, it would be attacked by Ancient Race and ferocious beasts, so the array formation was relatively high-level.
 Han Jue also completely integrated into the east city and became familiar with the neighbors.
 On this day.
 The entire city was covered in snow.
 Han Jue sat in the courtyard and admired the snow, comprehending the true meaning of heaven and earth.
 The old servant sweeping the snow beside him shook his head and sighed in his heart. “Master is lost in thought again. I don’t know what he’s reminiscing.”
 Han Jue’s servants were all very good. In their eyes, Han Jue’s greatest problem was that he would often fall into a daze. Sometimes, it was unimaginable that he could stand in the courtyard for a day and a night without moving
 At this moment, a maid rushed in and said anxiously, “Master, someone is lying in front of the door. He seems to be dead!”
 The rules of Eastern Guard City were strict. Killing someone meant paying with one’s life. If they were mistaken to be the ones who killed them, it would be troublesome.
 Han Jue immediately walked towards the door. He was living as a mortal, so he didn’t leave immediately.
 Arriving at the entrance of the residence, he saw a dirty woman lying in the snow. Already many people were gathered around her.
 Han Jue walked over and quickly breathed a sigh of relief. He then waved his right hand at the woman, dragging her soul back.
 The woman slowly opened her eyes. Although her face was dirty, her eyes were very clear and bright.
 Seeing that she had woken up, the surrounding people heaved a sigh of relief.
 Han Jue would give food to the people every year. In their eyes, he was a good person. They naturally didn’t want such a problem to happen to him.
 “Miss, go home soon. The snow is too heavy. Be careful not to get lost.”
 Han Jue smiled and walked into the courtyard.
 The breath he gave was enough for the other party to live for another fifty years, no different from ordinary mortals.
 In the evening
 Han Jue came to the table and prepared to eat. The servant girl standing at the side said, “Master, that woman is still outside the door. She said that you saved her, so she’s willing to do anything for you.”
 Han Jue said calmly, “Let her in and find a job for her.”
 The servant girl left.
 Five years later.
 Eastern Guard City welcomed a beast tide that was hard to come by in a hundred years. The entire city was on guard. Han Jue stood in the courtyard and looked at the smoke in all directions, lost in thought.
 A woman in green suddenly came over. She was not considered beautiful, but she was strange and likable.
 “Master, are you worried that the city will collapse?” the woman in green asked with a smile, not worried at all.
 She was the female beggar from five years ago, Qingluan’er. She was only seventeen at that time. After entering the Han family, this girl completely didn’t treat herself as a maid and always liked to pester Han Jue. However, she was indeed capable. She could do all the physical work in the courtyard and was stronger than men.
 Han Jue smiled. “Perhaps.”
 Qingluan’er curled her lips. “The answer is either yes or no. You always like to be so ambiguous. I can’t guess what you’re thinking.”
 Han Jue smiled and ignored her.
 After a few months, the city still survived tenaciously. However, the soldiers suffered heavy losses and the Human King had no choice but to send cultivators to help.
 The arrival of the cultivators stirred up a cultivation wind in the city.
 However, the humans were not Connate Humans. Their bloodlines were inherited from the previous Human Race of the Immeasurable Calamity. Their potential was good and bad.
 Han Jue pretended not to have cultivation potential and continued living an ordinary life.
 Another ten years passed.
 Han Jue got married.
 He married Qingluan’er. Other than her being interested in him, the servants, neighbors, and good friends had also spoken for her. In the eyes of mortals, he should also start a family and leave behind children.
 A year later, Qingluan’er got pregnant and gave birth to a child. His name was Han Tuo.
 This was deliberately controlled by Han Jue. Otherwise, he would never leave his bloodline behind.
 He suppressed Han Tuo’s cultivation potential, making him look no different from an ordinary person unless he encountered a Pseudo-Sage who could remove the bloodline seal.
 Han Jue planned to treat him well for a lifetime and take back his body after he reincarnated.
 After marrying and having children, Han Jue’s comprehension of the Dao deepened.
 The three thousand Great Dao were everywhere.
 Human affairs, earthly affairs, and heavenly affairs all had their own rules.
 Later, because Han Tuo had yearned to become an immortal who could fly in the sky since he was young, he cried and begged Qingluan’er to find an Immortal Master for him. Qingluan’er then looked for Han Jue. Helpless, Han Jue could only use his connections.
 In the end, Han Tuo was determined to have no cultivation potential. He was deeply affected.
Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels In a few days, he was lively again and acted mysteriously every day.
 Han Jue discovered that this kid seemed to be practicing martial arts.
 To be precise, he was tempering his body!
 Qingluan’er had taught him.
 Han Jue didn’t care or asked.
 On a small mountain in the city.
 The mother and son were in the forest.
 The well-dressed Qingluan’er looked at the young Han Tuo and instructed, “Tuo’er, regarding this method, you can’t spread it out or let your father know, lest he gets frightened.”
 Han Tuo waved his fists and nodded.
 He was only nine years old, but his actions were already very sharp.
 Qingluan’er’s eyes revealed a pained expression as she thought, “If my son had cultivation potential, with such will, he might be able to become an immortal in the future. Sigh.”
