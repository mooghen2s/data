 Han Jue raised his eyebrows. This Heavenly Devil was very strong.
 He looked up and saw that the 33rd Heaven was silent. The black hole that hid the Dao Heavenly Devil was still there. Purple lightning interweaved, and a silent pressure could be felt.
 Han Jue could sense the aura of the Dao Heavenly Devil. If this fellow didn’t escape, how did it hurt the Sages?
 Divine sense attack?
 Han Jue couldn’t figure it out.
 No matter what, the Dao Heavenly Devil had yet to enter the Heavenly Dao, so he still had time.
 During this period of time, Han Jue had to hurry up and become stronger. He had to strive to insta-kill the Dao Heavenly Devil as soon as possible.
 After reading the emails, Han Jue closed his eyes and started cultivating.
 The 33rd Heaven became extremely silent because of the appearance of the Dao Heavenly Devil. The Sages no longer preached the Dao, and no cultivators came to visit.
 This solemn atmosphere quickly spread to the Immortal World. The disciples of the Sage Sect began to spread rumors that the Heavenly Dao was about to face danger!
 Three hundred years later.
 The voice of the Sages suddenly sounded in the Immortal World.
 “I, South Extreme Heavenly Venerate, lead the Chan School to enter the Dao Sect. I will take Sage Qiu Xilai as the Dao Lord!”
 “I, Sect Master Tian Jue, lead the Jie School to enter the Dao Sect. I will take Sage Qiu Xilai as the Dao Lord!”
 “I, Fuxitian, lead the Human Race to believe in the Dao Sect. I will take Sage Qiu Xilai as the Dao Lord!”
 “I, Emperor Xiao, lead the Devil Race and the devil cultivators to enter the Dao Sect. I will take Sage Qiu Xilai as the Dao Lord!”
 “I, Qiu Xilai, lead the Buddhist Sect to join the Dao Sect. From today onwards, all Sages are part of the Dao Sect. The providence of the Heavenly Dao will return to the Dao Sect and all living beings will bear testament to it!”
 In the Daoist temple, Han Jue opened his eyes with a strange expression.
 The Sages were joining forces?
 With Qiu Xilai as the lead?
 Wait!
 Could it be that they wanted to pour all the Heavenly Dao providence into Qiu Xilai’s body and let him resist the Dao Heavenly Devil?
 The more Han Jue thought about it, the more he felt that it was possible.
 He looked up and saw that the Dao Field Qiu Xilai was in was enveloped by a huge barrier. It was holy and magnificent.
 Han Jue asked silently, “After Qiu Xilai fuses with the Heavenly Dao providence of the Sages, can he kill me?”.
 (Ten billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [It’s possible]
 Han Jue’s eyelids twitched. It seemed that he couldn’t leave the Dao Field anymore. Otherwise, he would easily fail.
 Han Jue adjusted his emotions and continued cultivating. As for the Dao Heavenly Devil, he couldn’t care less.
 He had to surpass Qiu Xilai first!
 Above the endless sea, Li Daokong and Shi Dudao floated above the clouds.
 Shi Dudao frowned. “If the Sages join forces, could it be that there is a terrifying existence hidden in that black hole?”
 Li Daokong said coldly, “Shi Dudao, focus on fighting me.”
 Hearing this, Shi Dudao looked impatient and said, “You aren’t my match at all. Why do you keep pestering me? Can’t you afford to lose?”
 “Hmph, you didn’t really defeat me.”
 “What do I have to do to win? Kill you?”
 “I know someone. His strength convinced me. Although you’re strong, you’re not strong enough to make me despair.”
 “Hehe.”
 Killing intent flashed across Shi Dudao’s eyes.
 The floating sea of clouds suddenly stopped. Even the waves stopped.
 In the distance.
 On the beach, Han Ming and Han Tuo watched from afar.
 The current Han Tuo was already mature. He was handsome, but his eyes revealed the vicissitudes of life. His white clothes fluttered in the wind, and he exuded an elegant air.
 Although Han Ming was handsome, he was much inferior to Han Tuo.
 “Who is Senior Li’s opponent?” Han Tuo asked.
 Han Ming said calmly, “He’s an existence that’s far beyond our reach. Don’t ask. Senior Li has yet to agree to take us in as disciples.” Han Tuo frowned. “Senior Li is so powerful. The Jie School let me go with just one sentence from him. How did you convince him to save me? Also, after they captured me, I met a cultivator surnamed Huang. After that, they treated me well. Why?
Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels “Brother Han, our surnames are both Han. Are you related to my father? Who is my father?”
 Han Tuo wasn’t stupid. After wandering for so many years, he discovered that what really made him rise was not his mother’s body tempering technique, but his own potential.
 The reason why the Immortal Master did not detect his cultivation potential was that his potential was too strong. Ordinary cultivators couldn’t see through him.
 He had once returned to the eastern city to find his parents, but he had only seen his mother’s tombstone. His father had long vanished. He had asked cultivators to deduce the karma, and his father had long died.
 If his father had a powerful background, he wouldn’t have died. In the worst case, he could have been harmed and lost his life.
 Every time he thought of this, Han Tuo would be furious.
 The thought that his father might have been killed by his enemies made the mysterious and violent power in his body restrain itself.
 Ever since he was young, he had always respected his father. If not for his father’s guidance, he would have died a hundred years ago.
 Han Ming looked into the distance and said, “We just happened to have the same surname. I don’t know your father. Don’t think too much. When I met you back then, didn’t you attack me? I even wanted to kill you. As for Senior Li, I have some affinity with him.”
 Han Tuo frowned. “What about the Jie School?”
 Han Ming rolled his eyes. “How would I know? They might want you to not suffer before your death. After all, it’s a Sage Sect. It won’t be good if news of them bullying you gets out. If they really have good intentions towards you, why would they trap you?”
 Han Tuo felt that it made sense.
 He couldn’t help but laugh at himself.
 He was really daydreaming sometimes. Could it be that he had encountered too many geniuses that he always looked forward to having mighty figures in his ancestry?
 It was just wishful thinking.
 Boom
 A terrifying wind suddenly swept along the sea. Han Tuo and Han Ming’s expressions changed drastically as they took out their Dharma treasures to block it.
 But how could they withstand the pressure of a Pseudo-Sage?
 Before the two of them could react, they were blown away and vanished into the horizon with the sand.
 33rd Heaven, Buddhist Dao Field.
 In the golden palace, the Sages gathered.
 Sect Master Tian Jue asked, “Qiu Xilai, how do you feel?”
 The other Sages also looked at him.
 Qiu Xilai did not maintain his true body that was ten thousand feet tall, but his mortal-like body. He slowly opened his eyes and said, “Not bad. I’m much stronger than before. I can even drive the Heavenly Dao’s power.”
 Fuxitian asked, “Can you defeat Dao Heavenly Devil?”
 Qiu Xilai had a complicated expression as he said, “Perhaps not. It’s still a little lacking. The Dao Heavenly Devil’s power of misfortune is too strong and can’t be killed. His power is at a higher level. If I want to kill him, I have to fuse the providence of the Heavenly Dao and the Sage Heart…”
 The Sages’ expressions changed.
 The reason why they formed the Dao Sect was to deal with the Dao Heavenly Devil.
 However, according to Qiu Xilai, once they fused, he would be the strongest Sage in the future. Even if they separated their providence, it would not affect his cultivation.
 Most importantly, this fellow had the Dao Destruction Mystical Power!
 The hall was silent and the atmosphere became strange.
 Qiu Xilai took a deep breath and said, “Fellow Daoists, we have gone through four Immeasurable Calamities. However, we are the only ones left at the top of the Heavenly Dao. No matter how we fight, it is considered internal strife. Now that the Dao Heavenly Devil is coming, if he swallows the Heavenly Dao, we will all die!
 “In this battle, all of you can only believe me. I won’t let you down!”
