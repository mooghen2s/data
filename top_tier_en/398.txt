 Han Jue secretly thought that he couldn’t be fooled by this one-star favorability.
 If he made the Dao Ancestor unhappy, he might just die.
 However, the Dao Ancestor should not be like that. The Sages’ plan was clearly targeted at the Dao Ancestor’s absence. If he was someone who would kill whenever he was unhappy, he wouldn’t have fused with the Heavenly Dao, much less create the Heavenly Court and the concept of Immortal Gods.
 Han Jue stopped thinking and continued cultivating.
 Perhaps the Dao Ancestor was watching him! The Dao Field could block the divine sense of a Sage, but the Dao Ancestor was not a Sage!
 But then again, the Dao Ancestor was actually a Chaotic Fiendcelestial!
 Did that mean that he was of the same generation as the Giant God Pangu?
 Even if he hadn’t died under Pangu’s hands back then, he had definitely been defeated, or he had not participated at all. However, he had surpassed them later on. As expected of the Grandmaster of the Seclusion Dao.
 Ten years later.
 Han Jue checked his emails while cultivating.
 (Your good friend Ji Xianshen was attacked by the True Dragon Race) x10228
 (Your grand-disciple Fang Liang has received guidance from your good friend Li Daokong. His cultivation has increased greatly.]
 (Your good friend Dao Sovereign has entered the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End.)
 [Your good friend Zhou Fan has absorbed the True Sun Flame. His body has transformed and he is indestructible.)
 [Your good friend Di Lantian was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure.]
 (Your good friend Duan Hongchen was cursed by a mysterious curse.]
 (Your good friend Xue Minghe was attacked by your good friend Di Lantian.)
 (Your good friend Dao Ancestor’s providence has decreased.]
 (Your good friend Dao Sovereign was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure and was severely injured. He was trapped in the Supreme Treasure.]
 Zhou Fan was counterattacking again.
 Han Jue no longer complained about his experience. Instead, he looked forward to how far he could grow.
 The Dao Ancestor’s providence had decreased. This was something worth thinking about.
 The providence of the Dao Ancestor was the providence of the entire Heavenly Dao. However, with the immense providence of the Dao Ancestor, this decrease was nothing.
 Han Jue continued reading. Dao Sovereign was beaten again.
 Serves you right!
 Bastard, you still want to drag me down!
 Han Jue gloated and even wanted to laugh.
 Serves you right!
 Immediately after, he became worried.
 Would this fellow ask him for help again?
 The more Han Jue thought about it, the more he felt that it was possible.
 He continued to read the emails. The situation in the Heavenly Court was still good. After the Heavenly Emperor changed, the Heavenly Court was not surrounded. On the contrary, the Golden Crow Divine Clan and Long Hao’s Dragon Court seemed to have become everyone’s target. It was also possible that they were the invaders and had a high screening rate.
 Ever since the Heavenly Emperor faked his death, Han Jue had been much more relaxed.
 At least the Heavenly Emperor was halfway out of the calamity.
 After reading the emails, Han Jue continued cultivating
 It was really good to stay in the Dark Forbidden Zone. It had been a long time since Hidden Sect Island had encountered trouble.
 The disciples of the Hidden Sect did not feel bored. They were all secretly competing. An invisible conflict surged in the Hidden Sect Island.
 It was worth mentioning that the Reroll World in the depths of Han Jue’s soul had also been developing
 As Han Jue became stronger, the connection between the Reroll World and the Heavenly Dao weakened. Han Jue’s Divine Origin Dharmic powers would divert a portion to support the Reroll World. Unknowingly, Han Jue seemed to want to eliminate the Heavenly Dao’s effect on the Reroll World.
 One day, the Reroll World would completely belong to him.
 Under the management of the White-Robed Buddha, the Reroll World had always been flourishing. The world was also expanding, all thanks to Han Jue’s Divine Origin Dharmic powers.
 The White-Robed Buddha rarely looked for Han Jue. He also knew that unless there was something important, he couldn’t disturb Han Jue.
 After so many years, the Jade Pure Sacred Sect had already become the number one Holy Land in the Reroll World. Daoist Nine Cauldrons had long retired. The sect master had already changed seven times. Some had died, and some had only retired to cultivate.
 In the entire Reroll World, only the Jade Pure Sacred Sect had greater karma with Han Jue. The White-Robed Buddha was very sensible.
 Twenty years later.
 Han Jue was cursing Li Xuan’ao when he suddenly sensed that someone in the Chaotic Domain was summoning him.
 It was unknown if it was Zhao Xuanyuan or Dao Sovereign.
 Han Jue put down the Book of Misfortune and entered the Chaotic Domain with his consciousness.
 He wanted to hear how miserable Dao Sovereign was. Dao Sovereign and Zhao Xuanyuan were both there.
 Han Jue smiled and asked, “The Heavenly Court has already changed the Heavenly Emperor. Who do you want me to find to save
 you?”
 Dao Sovereign was furious. “What do you mean? Do you really think I need saving?”
 “No need?”
 Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief.
 Dao Sovereign snorted. “Who do you think I am? I discovered the Dao Literature left behind by the Dao Ancestor in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End. This is a huge opportunity!”
 Han Jue said, “I’m not going.” “Really, it records a Zenith Heaven technique!”
 “No, I’m not going.”
 “Do you think I’m lying to you?”
 “Then, do you need me to save you?”
 “No need!”
 Dao Sovereign was furious. Han Jue was looking down on him!
 Zhao Xuanyuan, who had not said a word, couldn’t help but say, “Brother Dao, stop pretending. I can’t hold on anymore. Call for help!”
 He looked at Han Jue and said, “We indeed discovered the Dao Literature. The restrictions are too strong. We wanted to go back and call for help, but we were stopped by a Zenith Heaven expert on the way. He deduced that we had karma with the Dao Literature…”
 There was no need to say anything else. It was just a confession.
 Han Jue said, “You should tell the truth. I’m helpless.”
 The current Heavenly Court couldn’t save Dao Sovereign.
 Dao Sovereign said, “You can think of a way to contact Li Daokong. He will definitely be interested.”
 Han Jue said, “You can’t always ask me for help, right? You have to pay something.”
 Dao Sovereign fell silent.
 Zhao Xuanyuan said, “If we’re saved, we’re willing to share the Dao Literature with you.”
 “Can we share it directly in the Chaotic Domain?”
Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates “Yes, but not now. We haven’t had time to comprehend it.”
 “Mm.”
 After Han Jue agreed, he hurriedly left the Chaotic Domain.
 After returning to reality, Han Jue took out the Heavenly Dao Token and started to use his Dharmic powers.
 After the Heavenly Emperor left, this token should have been given to Fang Liang.
 Soon, his divine sense connected.
 A familiar voice sounded, “Grandmaster.”
 It was Fang Liang!
 His voice trembled, clearly nervous.
 Han Jue asked, “How does it feel to be the Heavenly Emperor?”
 Fang Liang smiled bitterly. “Not good. I’m under a lot of pressure. Actually, I didn’t want this, but… Sigh!”
 He couldn’t help but feel bitter.
 Han Jue couldn’t be bothered to ask. He directly told Fang Liang what Dao Sovereign had asked him to tell Li Daokong. As for whether Li Daokong would go or not, that was up to him. Han Jue couldn’t care less.
 “No problem.” Fang Liang agreed readily. He paused and asked, “What’s your relationship with Li Daokong? He admires you and hopes to see you again.”
 Han Jue replied, “Help me thank him for his kind intentions. I’m avoiding the calamity. After the Immeasurable Calamity ends, I’ll personally visit him and also go to the Heavenly Court.”
 Fang Liang smiled and said, “Alright, I’ll give you the title of Heavenly Emperor to Master!”
 “Don’t be ridiculous. I don’t want it. That’s all, bye.”
 Han Jue hurriedly cut off the divine sense connection and continued cultivating.
 Heavenly Court!
 Fang Liang came to Li Daokong’s palace and told him about Han Jue’s request.
 Li Daokong asked curiously, “Where is your grandmaster hiding? Why can’t I deduce it? Could he be in the Nine Nether Purgatory? Or is it the Dark Forbidden Zone?”
 Fang Liang shook his head and said, “I’m not sure, either. It shouldn’t be the Nine Nether Purgatory. It’s already in chaos. As for the Dark Forbidden Zone, is that place suitable for cultivation?”
