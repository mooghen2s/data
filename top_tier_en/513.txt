 Huang Jihao frowned. He had heard of this name before, but he didn’t have a deep impression of it.
 Could it be that there was a Long-arm Ape hidden in the Hidden Sect?
 Li Xuan’ao said, “Don’t cause trouble after entering the Hidden Sect. Cultivate well in peace. You should be able to sense the Immortal Qi here. It’s denser than anywhere else in the Immortal World. This is definitely the best place to cultivate.”
 Huang Jihao sensed carefully and his expression changed drastically.
 Such dense Immortal Qi and Connate Qi!
 This was even more domineering than the Heavenly Race’s Holy Land and the Sage Dao Field!
 If he cultivated here…
 Huang Jihao’s heart beat faster. He was glad that he had come here.
 He asked curiously, “Master, the master of the Hidden Sect is…”
 Li Xuan’ao glared at him and said in a low voice, “Don’t ask what you shouldn’t ask!”
 Han Jue always wore the Sun and Moon Yin-Yang Protection. Most of the in-name disciples had never seen his true appearance. Li Xuan’ao guessed that Han Jue wanted to hide his identity and naturally couldn’t tell Huang Jihao.
 After Huang Jihao was warned, he became even more curious.
 Who replaced Han Jue?
 Huang Jihao’s addition to the Hidden Sect did not cause a stir. Not to mention the new disciples, even the old disciples had forgotten about him.
 Who could remember the small grudge from more than thirty thousand years ago?
 The reason why Han Jue remembered Huang Jihao was because he was especially active in the emails.
 Time passed.
 After Han Jue focused on attaining the Dao, time passed quickly.
 In the blink of an eye.
 Another hundred years passed.
 Han Jue walked out of the Daoist temple and wandered around the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 His understanding of the Great Dao of Extreme Origin was already very deep. His cultivation level could no longer increase, but he was still a step away from attaining the Dao.
 Which step was it?
 Han Jue couldn’t figure it out.
 He felt that he had to relax.
 The divine light of the Sun and Moon Yin-Yang Protection shone on Han Jue. The disciples who met him along the way knelt down and bowed. He didn’t talk to them and continued forward.
 Looking at his back, the in-name disciples revealed looks of reverence and yearning.
 Because of Han Jue, they had such a place to cultivate in peace. Even Sages couldn’t threaten them.
 After walking around the Hundred Peak Immortal River, Han Jue seemed to have comprehended something.
 This feeling was indescribable.
 What was a Sage?
 Was it just that their Dharmic powers were strong?
 That was not the case.
 Apart from reaching the limit of his cultivation, he also needed a state of mind.
 Han Jue had too few experiences in his life. It was so few that he was even inferior to ordinary mortals.
 “Perhaps I should go out.”
 Han Jue thought silently, and his eyes gradually became firm.
 “If I walk out of the Dao Field and travel in the Immortal World now, will I be in danger?” Han Jue asked cautiously.
 (3 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [No]
 Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief. He returned to the Daoist temple and started to create a Heavenly Puppet.
 He had to leave a clone in the Daoist temple before he could leave without any worries.
 Several days later, Han Jue left quietly without alerting anyone.
 He suppressed his cultivation until it was unnoticeable and used his Dharmic powers to hide his Supreme Treasures. He transformed into an ordinary white-robed man with his unparalleled true handsome appearance.
 It had been more than thirty thousand years. This was Han Jue’s first time traveling the Immortal World. Although he knew that there was no danger, he was still a little nervous.
 However, as time passed, he quickly calmed down.
 He did not fly, but walked through the world, using his feet to walk past dangerous mountains and precipices. He saw endless, magnificent green lakes, heard wind roars like dragon roars, and also bathed in rainwater caused by Immortal Qi.
 As he learned more and more, his understanding of the Great Dao of Extreme Origin also deepened.
 The Great Dao of Extreme Origin was all-encompassing. All existences could become the Great Dao.
 About eighty years passed.
 Night fell.
 Han Jue stopped by the lake and started to meditate and cultivate. He recalled his feelings over the years.
 He wasn’t involved in karma with other living beings. He had always walked alone.
 The moon was like water and the surface of the lake was shimmering. The surrounding forest swayed slightly in the wind. The wind sounded like music as it caused Han Jue’s black hair to flutter.
 Swoosh,
 A sound came from the bushes behind him. A red fox appeared. It looked as big as a human pet cat.
 It blinked its big eyes at Han Jue.
Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎 After hesitating for a while, it carefully came to his side and knelt down like a human, pressing its forehead against the grass.
 Han Jue’s eyes remained closed as if he didn’t notice its arrival.
 It called out, but he ignored it. The crimson fox was a little anxious, but it still chose to kneel.
 The moon set and night alternated.
 Ten days later.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and glanced at the crimson fox beside him. “Why did you worship me?”
 The crimson fox said, “I want to cultivate with you.”
 “I’m only a mortal. I don’t have much cultivation.”
 “I’m born with different pupils. I can spy on souls. Your soul blocked my prying.”
 Han Jue shook his head and slowly stood up.
 He wasn’t interested in the crimson fox. It couldn’t even reach the standard of the system’s Connate providence bearer. Its potential was average.
 Han Jue left, and the crimson fox followed.
 The man and the fox continued wandering the world.
 Han Jue didn’t expel the crimson fox. He also wanted to see how determined this little fellow was.
 In the years to come, they experienced all sorts of natural disasters and passed by all sorts of magnificent sights. Occasionally, they would encounter lifeforms that had transformed.
 Han Jue didn’t take the initiative to provoke other living beings, so he didn’t encounter any robbery.
 He didn’t look like someone with a Supreme Treasure.
 Two hundred years later.
 Han Jue came to a human city. From afar, sand filled the sky and almost drowned this huge city.
 He turned around and glanced at the crimson fox behind him. “Let’s end it here.”
 With that, he continued forward and vanished into the sand.
 The crimson fox was silent. It did not follow because it would die if it went, but it did not leave. Instead, it crawled on the sand dune and looked at the huge city in the distance.
 Han Jue came to the city gate. Soldiers were guarding it. He needed to pay spirit stones to enter the city. He casually used his method and took out the spirit stones to successfully enter the city.
 After entering the city, Han Jue’s face attracted many people’s attention.
 Han Jue didn’t deliberately hide his appearance because there was no need. He wasn’t afraid of trouble.
 With a breath, the entire city would be reduced to dust.
 The city was not as desolate as it looked from the outside. It even looked like spring and was full of life. From time to time, trees could be seen on both sides of the street. It had the good scenery of brilliant rivers.
 Han Jue came to an inn and sat down in a corner on the second floor.
 After ordering food and drinks from the waiter, he turned to look at the streets outside the window. Looking at the people walking around, he was deeply moved.
 Not long ago, he was also one of these people.
 “You seem confused.”
 A laugh sounded, and an old Daoist walked over.
 Han Jue glanced at him.
 Eh?
 Grand Unity Golden Immortal!
 The old Daoist sat in front of Han Jue and smiled. “Encounter is a type of affinity. You can ask me if you have any questions. Sometimes, others can see things more clearly and answer them for you.”
