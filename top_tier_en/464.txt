 Facing Han Jue’s answer, Qiu Xilai responded. It was unknown if he believed it.
 Han Jue asked, “My disciple Su Qi…”
 He did not finish his sentence. He believed that Qiu Xilai would understand.
 Qiu Xilai replied, “He’s imprisoned in the Heavenly Race’s prison and will be executed a hundred years later. At that time, I will protect his soul and hand it to you. Remember, you can’t leave him in the Heavenly Dao’s territory.”
 Han Jue quickly thanked him.
 It was fine as long as he could leave a chance of survival for Su Qi.
 Su Qi indeed deserved death. The Dao Destruction Mystical Power slaughtered all living beings. If he didn’t punish him, who knew if this fellow would become twisted in the future and become arrogant?
 Qiu Xilai didn’t say anything else and left the dream.
 Han Jue’s consciousness returned to reality. He suddenly discovered that Qiu Xilai didn’t seem to be as passionate towards him as before. He spoke less.
 Perhaps it was related to the end of the calamity. Qiu Xilai felt that he had won and no longer cared about the so-called variable of the Dao Ancestor.
 Han Jue smiled. This was also a good thing.
 The less he valued him, the easier it was for him to develop quietly.
 How shocked would Qiu Xilai be when he suddenly turned around and discovered that Han Jue was already a Sage?
 Han Jue stopped thinking and continued cultivating
 According to the inheritance of the Primordial Chaos Reincarnation Great Dao cultivation technique, if he wanted to reach the Pseudo-Sage Realm, he had to deepen his understanding of the Great Dao. Han Jue absorbed the negative karma of the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus while comprehending the Great Dao of Extreme Origin.
 As for the previous Great Dao of Life and Death, Han Jue planned to give it up.
 If someone had already cultivated the Great Dao of Life and Death, it would be difficult for Han Jue to surpass the other party.
 The Great Dao of Extreme Origin was different. Han Jue could cultivate this Great Dao exclusive to him without worries.
 Soon, he entered the Dao Comprehension state.
 The Great Dao of Extreme Origin was unfathomable. Even if it was created by Han Jue, it still required a long time to completely comprehend.
 A hundred years passed in the blink of an eye.
 On this day, Han Jue finally saw Su Qi’s emails.
 [Your disciple Su Qi was punished by the Heavenly Race and died. His soul was luckily saved by the Sage.]
𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief. Although Qiu Xilai had come to hide a conspiracy, he really meant what he said.
 Recently, his emails had become active again. Almost all of them were emails from his good friends from the Heavenly Race who had obtained opportunities.
 With the deaths of all living beings in the Heavenly Dao, too many Dharma treasures were lost in the mortal world.
 Han Jue thought for a moment and gathered the disciples.
 “Do you want to go out?” Han Jue asked.
 Hearing this, the disciples were stunned. No one said anything. They thought that he was testing them.
 Han Jue smiled and said, “The Heavenly Dao has been restarted. There are too many treasures in the world. If you have any thoughts, you can go out and collect them. The Dharma treasures are all yours. If you find any natural treasures, bring them back and plant them in the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 “Remember, when you encounter those huge remains, take a detour. Those remains have already become evil. They contain the power of curses and might even possess you.” Everyone’s eyes lit up. They actually had such thoughts long ago, but without Han Jue’s agreement, they didn’t dare to act recklessly. Zhao Xuanyuan, Dao Sovereign, Jiang Yi, Murong Qi, Xun Chang’an, and the others spoke.
 Han Jue agreed.
 In the end, only the Black Hell Chicken, the Chaotic Heavenly Dog, and Li Yao stayed behind. Even Xing Hongxuan, Fairy Xi Xuan, and Chang Yue’er went out.
 This was the first time Dao Comprehension Sword went out. She was very nervous, but with others accompanying her, nothing should happen. Han Jue forbade them from acting alone and required at least three people to form a team.
 Han Jue looked at the Chaotic Heavenly Dog and asked teasingly, “Why aren’t you going?”
 The Chaotic Heavenly Dog shook its head in fear and said, “I’m not going out. I won’t go out even if I die!”
 Han Jue smiled.
 It seemed that Li Xuan’ao had traumatized the Chaotic Heavenly Dog too much.
 He thought of Li Xuan’ao and did not see Li Daokong recently. This fellow had just reached the perfected Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm not long ago and was probably in seclusion somewhere.
 The Black Hell Chicken smiled. “Dog son, your awareness is not bad.”
 The Chaotic Heavenly Dog smiled smugly.
 Han Jue looked at Li Yao and asked, “You don’t dare to go out, too? Although your potential is not bad, you have too few treasures.”
 Li Yao shook her head. “Dharma treasures are external objects, after all. I only believe in my own Mystical Powers.”
 Han Jue had nothing to say about this.
 The four of them dispersed and returned to cultivate.
 Five years later.
 Qiu Xilai sent a dream to Han Jue and said that he wanted to give Su Qi’s soul to him and asked him to go to the 33rd Heaven.
 The 33rd Heaven was a place that even the Heavenly Dao could not control.
 Han Jue thought for a moment and let his Heavenly Puppet go.
 After the Heavenly Puppet was injected with his Dharmic powers, it was equivalent to a Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal. It wasn’t difficult for it to fly to the 33rd Heaven.
 Half a year later, the Heavenly Puppet returned with Su Qi’s soul.
 Han Jue directly took him into the world of stars and suppressed him in a star to contain his bad luck. He would wait for the right time to release Su Qi for reincarnation.
 Han Jue was the only one left in the Daoist temple. The Strange Deity liked to wander around the Hundred Peak Immortal River and rarely returned. However, it could already control its strength, so it wouldn’t harm others. Therefore, Han Jue let it move freely as long as it did not leave the Daoist temple.
 Han Jue took out the Book of Misfortune and started cursing Sage Fated Secrets.
 The Hundred Peak Immortal River was isolated by a Dao Field, and the Daoist temple was isolated by a system barrier. Han Jue wasn’t worried about being discovered.
 After so many years, he had never failed to curse Sage Fated Secrets. It happened once every ten years.
 Time flew.
 Three hundred years passed quickly.
 One of the Qilin eggs in the cave finally hatched. Han Jue asked his Reincarnation Avatar, Liu Bei, to take care of it. Liu Bei immediately informed him.
 Han Jue sent a voice transmission to Liu Bei and asked him to take care of the Qilin.
 Liu Bei was naturally happy. Once nurtured well, this Qilin Race member might listen to him in the future. At that time, he would have the right to speak in the Hidden Sect.
 Although Liu Bei was Han Jue’s clone, he also had his own independent thinking. Other than never betraying Han Jue, his heart was human.
 After so many years, the disciples of the Hidden Sect who had gone out had yet to return. They were probably still gathering their treasures and no one was injured.
 Han Jue was still far from the Pseudo-Sage Realm, but he was not in a hurry. What he did not lack the most now was time.
 On this day, Han Jue’s Heavenly Dao Token sent a divine sense.
 Han Jue took it out and connected his divine sense.
 “Grandmaster.” Fang Liang’s respectful voice sounded.
 Han Jue smiled and said, “You’re still alive.”
 He naturally knew that Fang Liang was still alive and deliberately teased him.
 Fang Liang said awkwardly, “Cough cough, we’ve finally made it through. For example, the Heavenly Dao treats the Heavenly Race as its leader. The leader of the Heavenly Race is Ji Xianshen. Grandmaster, you can return to the Immortal World. It’s very safe.”
 Han Jue replied, “I’m already back.”
 “Oh? Where? Can I visit?”
 “I can’t tell you for the time being. Is there anything else?”
 Han Jue was very cautious and didn’t trust his grand-disciple completely.
 Fang Liang said, “The Heavenly Dao has been restarted. I want to invite the Hidden Sect to join the Heavenly Court as Immortal Gods. You will have a chance to become part of the Heavenly Race in the future. The Heavenly Race is a Heavenly Dao Race and will not be affected in the next few calamities.”
 Han Jue raised his eyebrows.
 From the sound of it, the Heavenly Court had already become a subsidiary force of the Heavenly Race.
