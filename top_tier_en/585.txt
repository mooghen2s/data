 He had always looked down on demons. He felt that they were too weak and did not have a leader.
Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com The disciple replied, “The Heavenly Race is willing to send five hundred Immortal Emperors after we battle the demons.”
 Five hundred Immortal Emperors…
 Huang Zuntian frowned. He was a little disappointed. Five hundred Immortal Emperors might cause trouble for the Deity Realm, but facing Zenith Heaven, they were no different from mortals. However, this was also good. The less the Heavenly Race contributed, the more confident he would be when splitting the benefits.
 “Yes, you can leave first.”
 “Yes!”
 After the disciple left, Huang Zuntian continued to look at the distant lecture.
 There was no hurry in fighting the demons. He had to deploy them. He couldn’t let the tragedy that had happened in the mortal world tens of thousands of years ago happen again.
 But then again, he had bumped into a Sage.
 Otherwise, he might not have lost.
 Like the others, Huang Zuntian determined that Han Jue was a Sage and was only reincarnating to train.
 Huang Zuntian turned around and returned to the Daoist temple. He smiled confidently and expectantly.
 Now, he could not pursue much.
 Only the Sage position could make him risk everything!
 Time passed.
 More than 1,500 years passed.
 [Detected that you are 80,000 years old and your life has taken another step forward. You have the following choices:]
 [1: Exit seclusion immediately and head to the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End to pursue the Great Dao. You can obtain a Heavenly Dao Spirit Stone, a Great Dao Fragment, a Supreme Treasure, and a Mystical Power inheritance.]
 [2: Cultivate in a low profile manner and do not leave the area of the Heavenly Dao. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment and a random natural treasure.]
 Han Jue opened his eyes and cursed the dog system.
 Trying to lure me out again!
 Han Jue directly chose the second option.
 It was impossible for him to leave the Heavenly Dao.
 Han Jue’s cultivation path was to let his territory constantly expand and not go to foreign places to wander.
 (You chose to cultivate in a low profile manner and obtained a Great Dao Fragment and a random natural treasure.]
 [Congratulations on obtaining the Buzhou Divine Mountain.]
 [Buzhou Divine Mountain: It is formed by the backbone of the Giant God Pangu. It can produce Connate Qi and increase the providence of the Heavenly Dao. As long as you throw it into the ground, it can evolve by itself.]
 Han Jue was stunned.
 The system could even produce the Buzhou Divine Mountain? A long time ago, the Buzhou Divine Mountain was broken by the Ancestral Magus. After that, all living beings could no longer see the Buzhou Divine Mountain’s majesty. Han Jue took it out. A small mountain floated in his hand, and he couldn’t feel its weight.
 What was the use of this?
 Han Jue no longer needed to rely on natural treasures to increase the Spirit Qi in the Dao Field. The Dao Field itself was filled with Spirit
 Qi.
 He suddenly noticed that this thing could increase the Heavenly Dao’s providence.
 He immediately had an idea. He sent a dream to Li Daokong and asked him to return.
 Half a day later, Li Daokong arrived outside the Hundred Peak Immortal River and was moved into the Dao Field by him.
 Han Jue took out the Buzhou Divine Mountain and said, “This is the Buzhou Divine Mountain. Take it and choose a vast place to put it down. It can allow you to obtain the Heavenly Dao’s providence. Hold it well. This is your first step to becoming a Sage.”
 Li Daokong was stunned. He had also heard of the legend of Buzhou Divine Mountain.
 Where did Sect Master obtain it?
 Shocked, Li Daokong subconsciously reached out to take the Buzhou Divine Mountain.
 “From now on, you’re the Buzhou Divine Mountain’s master. You can do whatever you want with it.” Han Jue chuckled.
 Li Daokong asked, “What do you need me to do?”
 Han Jue said, “If a living being goes to Buzhou Divine Mountain, you can also accept it and help increase your providence. Without merit, it’s very difficult to become a Sage. Of course, if you want to use your strength to attain the Dao, that’s fine too, but the time needed is immeasurable. Since ancient times, every Sage has relied on the Heavenly Dao Purple Qi to become a Sage. There are too few cultivators who use their strength to attain the Dao.”
 Li Daokong had no system and was not a Primordial Fiendcelestial. Han Jue didn’t believe that he could use his strength to attain the Dao.
 Even if he had this potential, he couldn’t escape the Heavenly Dao’s karma. The reason Han Jue could was that he didn’t rely on the Heavenly Dao at all and had been cultivating in the system’s Dao Field. The Heavenly Dao couldn’t restrain him.
 “I understand,” Li Daokong said in a low voice, his heart filled with gratitude.
 Han Jue really wanted to help him become a Sage.
 Han Jue waved his sleeve and moved Li Daokong out.
 The path had been paved. What to do next was up to Li Daokong. Han Jue hoped that Li Daokong could control the Heavenly Dao alone. This way, he wouldn’t be restricted by it.
 Seventy-four years later.
 “I am the First Guardian of the Hidden Sect, Li Daokong. Today, I have restored the Buzhou Divine Mountain and strengthened the Heavenly Dao’s providence. All sword cultivators of the myriad worlds can come to the Buzhou Divine Mountain to ask about the Sword Dao!”
 Li Daokong’s voice suddenly resounded through the myriad worlds.
 At the same time, all the cultivators above the Deity Realm could sense that the providence in the east had increased.
 This time, even the Sages outside the 33rd Heaven were alarmed.
 They gathered in the Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du’s hall.
 “Is it really the Buzhou Divine Mountain?”
 “Indeed. I’ve seen the Buzhou Divine Mountain before. This aura is correct.”
 “How did Han Jue obtain it?”
 “I’m not sure. It might be formed by some Mystical Power.”
 “With this move, Li Daokong’s position as a future Sage is stable.”
 The Sages sighed. Even Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du was the same.
 The masters of the Sages, Fuxitian, and Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du had all seen Buzhou Divine Mountain before. They had even stayed there for a period of time. Looking at the majestic huge vein rising, they felt as if they were seeing the vicissitudes of the Primordial World.
 After putting down Buzhou Divine Mountain, a huge Heavenly Dao Merit descended from the sky and landed on Li Daokong.
 The Buzhou Divine Mountain was vast and could produce endless Connate Qi. It could nurture countless living beings. This merit was extremely great and was enough to increase Li Daokong’s cultivation level by a minor realm.
 As more and more living beings appeared on the Buzhou Divine Mountain in the future, the providence of the Heavenly Dao that nurtured Li Daokong was even more unimaginable. Li Daokong immediately became famous in the heavens!
 The Hidden Sect became famous again.
 A Guardian was already so powerful. How strong was the sect master, the Immeasurable Merit Divine Might Heavenly Sage?
 In a valley in the Immortal World.
 Han Yu stood up and looked to the east. He muttered, “Buzhou Divine Mountain… sword cultivator…”
 Ever since he ascended, he had been wandering around aimlessly. Now that such an opportunity had appeared, he felt that this was his chance.
 Not hesitating, he immediately flew towards the majestic aura.
 Perhaps he could even acknowledge the mighty figure named Li Daokong as his master!
 It was not only Han Yu. Countless living beings in the myriad worlds had such thoughts.
 13th Heaven.
 Ji Xianshen stood in a courtyard and looked down at the sea of clouds.
 “Good move. As expected of Master.”
 Ji Xianshen was secretly shocked. The Buzhou Divine Mountain’s providence was truly terrifying. It had just landed and was already more majestic than his entire Heavenly Race. Such a method was definitely used by Han Jue to support Li Daokong.
 Recalling the legends of the Buzhou Divine Mountain, he suddenly understood.
 Legend had it that the Buzhou Divine Mountain was formed by the creation of the Giant God Pangu, Qiu Liang. The Heavenly Dao was the will of the Giant God Pangu. How could the appearance of the Buzhou Divine Mountain not receive a response from the Heavenly Dao?
 Ji Xianshen frowned.
 Wait!
 If Li Daokong had the Buzhou Divine Mountain, would he still guard the Heavenly Race?
 The Hidden Sect Immortal Emperors in the Heavenly Race would probably also leave.
