 Li Muyi couldn’t care less about his reputation and said, “That’s right. Sage Fated Secrets has already gone mad. If there’s another one, the situation will be very difficult to control. In the future, the Mad Sage might destroy the Heavenly Dao. You definitely don’t want to see that situation, right?”
 Ancestor Xitian said with an indifferent expression, “What does that have to do with me?”
 The atmosphere instantly turned solemn.
 The Sages became nervous, afraid that they would offend him.
 They all knew that Ancestor Xitian was an existence that surpassed the Heavenly Dao and was also their guardian deity. Because of his existence, they could fight openly and secretly without worries and use the heavens as a chessboard.
 Ancestor Xitian sighed. “The Heavenly Dao will continue to circulate no matter who it leaves. It’s the same even for the Dao Ancestor. We can’t affect the Heavenly Dao. The Heavenly Dao is very special and might surpass the Great Dao in the future. If you are united, you will definitely have a great opportunity in the future. Stop targeting the variable. I’ve calculated that he’s not important to the Heavenly Dao.”
 The Sages had different expressions, and it was unknown what they were thinking.
 They all realized that Ancestor Xitian did not want to interfere in the Heavenly Dao.
 However, the matter of the Dark Forbidden Lord was a thorn in their hearts. No one would feel good if they didn’t pull it out.
 Six hundred years later.
 Inside the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 Han Jue had just finished preaching to the Hidden Sect. This lecture lasted for a hundred years. He specially mentioned the Heavenly Devils’ existence and explained the golden rain phenomenon.
 However, the disciples were still in a state of Dao comprehension and had yet to discuss the Heavenly Devils.
 Han Jue came to the Fusang Tree and observed it.
 After so many years, the Fusang Tree was still the treasure he valued the most. To be precise, it was his disciple.
 “Sect Master, when can I transform?” the Fusang Tree asked, its voice becoming more and more pleasant.
 It was unknown if it had been led astray by Tu Ling’er and Dao Comprehension Sword, but it was becoming more and more like a woman.
 There was no such thing as a male or female tree.
 Han Jue said, “Why do you want to transform?”
 The Fusang Tree said aggrievedly, “Because I want to move.”
 “Don’t worry. You will transform sooner or later. At that time, you will be grateful for the time you can’t move now.”
 “Why?”
 “Because you can’t move, you can only focus on cultivating. Once you can move, all sorts of mental demons will attack. You can ask the Chaotic Heavenly Dog.” “I’m tired of hearing these stories, but I…”
 “Let’s wait a little longer. You can’t go out if you don’t reach the Pseudo-Sage Realm. The other disciples can’t move too.”
 “Fine.”
 The Fusang Tree felt wronged.
 Han Jue shook his head and laughed. He turned around and left.
 It wasn’t that he didn’t let the Fusang Tree transform, but that he really couldn’t.
 The Fusang Tree was a Heavenly Dao Divine Tree with extraordinary meaning. The Heavenly Dao wouldn’t let it transform easily. Han Jue had tried to help it transform, but he could feel the resistance of the Heavenly Dao.
 The Heavenly Dao’s existence was indescribable, and even Pseudo-Sage couldn’t capture it. However, when it touched the rules of the Heavenly Dao, the reaction was very strong
 After returning to the Daoist temple, Han Jue didn’t cultivate immediately but checked his emails.
 Recently, the changes in the Immortal World had been a little big. Han Jue became interested and liked to pay attention to the emails when he had nothing to do.
 This feeling…
 It was like surfing the web!
 After more than twenty thousand years, the Immortal World finally stirred again. It didn’t have to be so boring.
 Han Jue saw two emails.
 (Your good friend Jiang Dugu suffered a backlash from a mysterious existence. His cultivation has fallen to the Zenith Heaven Realm.)
 (Your good friend Jiang Dugu has become a Pseudo-Sage.]
 There were dozens of emails between the two.
 What had happened to Jiang Dugu recently?
 Why was he repeatedly jumping between the Zenith Heaven and Pseudo-Sage Realm?
 What was the mysterious existence?
 Han Jue wanted to know, but he didn’t want to consume his lifespan for Jiang Dugu.
 Forget it, he would leave it for the future to answer his questions. He would just think about it. In any case, Jiang Dugu couldn’t threaten him.
 …
 Seven years later.
 The leader of the Nether Race, Han You, came to visit him.
 Han You had come to report the development of the Nether Race.
 Currently, more than a thousand Nether Race members had stepped into the Deity Realm, and the number was still increasing.
 Actually, Han Jue knew this, but he didn’t ask Han You about it.
 Han You had clearly meant something else.
 Han Jue understood his thoughts and said, “The Nether Race has developed well. I will especially preach the Dao for them alone and teach them Mystical Powers.”
 Han You was pleasantly surprised.
 The worst thing about the Nether Race was their lack of Mystical Powers.
 They didn’t lack anything in the Hundred Peak Immortal River. Han Jue never avoided them when preaching. It was just that they didn’t have a proper master. Their Mystical Powers were much inferior to the ones the personal disciples possessed.
 They also wanted to rise in the hundred-year competition.
 Han Jue allowed such competition.
 Seclusion was not cowardice. They also had to work hard to become stronger and pursue strength that allowed them to roam unhindered!
 Han Jue’s seclusion was meant to help him stay out of seclusion in the future!
 After Han You left, he continued cultivating.
 He was getting closer and closer to attaining the Dao.
 It was impossible to estimate the exact time. Perhaps one day, he would succeed in attaining the Dao. He only needed a suitable opportunity.
 He only needed to comprehend the Great Dao of Extreme Origin diligently.
 Time passed.
 Seventy years later.
 All the disciples woke up from their Dao comprehension state and started to discuss the Heavenly Devil that Han Jue had mentioned.
 They were only curious and not afraid.
 That day, when the Heavenly Devil cast a spell, it did not break through the array formation. This meant that the array formation of the Hundred Peak Immortal River was powerful enough.
 On this day.
 The Hundred Peak Immortal River welcomed an immortal with white hair. He wore a Daoist robe and had a sword at his waist. He stood on an immortal crane and had an immortal aura.
 This Immortal was Huang Jihao.
 Looking at the Hundred Peak Immortal River ahead, Huang Jihao’s expression was unnatural. The immortal crane collided with an invisible barrier and stopped.
 He said, “I’m Huang Jihao. I wonder if Li Daokong and Li Xuan’ao are here?”
 The Hundred Peak Immortal River was silent. No one replied.
 Huang Jihao frowned.
 At this moment, Li Xuan’ao’s voice floated out, “Eh? Why are you still alive?”
 Huang Jihao immediately felt depressed. He said in a low voice, “Master, it seems that you’ve really forgotten about me. Can I continue to follow you?”
 “Why?”
 “I’m being hunted down by the Heavenly Race.”
 “Why are they chasing you?”
 “I killed their people.”
 “Why?”
 “I… What do you mean?”
 Huang Jihao almost exploded in anger. He had come with joy, but in the end, he was treated like this. He was also a proud person, how could he tolerate this?
 Li Xuan’ao said, “It’s not that easy to join the Hidden Sect. I don’t have the right to decide, either. I’ll help you ask.”
 “Thank you, Master,” Huang Jihao replied as he sighed in his heart.
 He was really curious about the Hidden Sect. He knew that the Hidden Sect’s master was Han Jue.
 However, during the entire Immeasurable Calamity, he had never heard of him. Now that the Hidden Sect was famous, he suspected that it had already changed owners.
Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎 Otherwise, how could a proud person like Li Daokong join the Hidden Sect?
 Thinking of Han Jue, Huang Jihao sighed.
 He didn’t expect that so many influential figures had appeared in the Scarlet Cloud World back then. It was considered one of the top providence worlds in the mortal world.
 Just as Huang Jihao was thinking, his vision blurred and he appeared in front of Li Xuan’ao.
 Li Xuan’ao sized him up and clicked his tongue in wonder. “Two Mystic Divine Origin. Not bad. But your potential is a little poor compared to the Long-arm Ape.”
