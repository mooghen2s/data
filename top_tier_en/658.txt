 Great Dao Supreme Treasure! Han Jue was enlightened. No wonder the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End still dared to invade the Heavenly Dao after the Dark Forbidden Lord attacked!
 So he was prepared! Even the Chaotic Deity or Cundi didn’t have such a Supreme Treasure. How could Divine Lord Peacock obtain it? Does this fellow have a stronger backing? Han Jue continued to derive. (160 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?) Continue!
 [Heavenly Lord of Primordial Beginning: Great Dao Sage, Immeasurable Emperor, founder of the Chan School. Because you stopped the Dark Sage King from destroying the Heavenly Dao, he has developed hatred towards you. Current Hatred Points: 2 stars] It was him! Han Jue frowned and was still very puzzled. The Karma Bead was even more valuable than the Heavenly Lord of Primordial Beginning. Would he be willing to give this treasure to the Divine Lord Peacock?
 The Karma Bead was probably Divine Lord Peacock’s Dharma treasure.
 To be able to control such a Dharma treasure and not be fought over by the Great Dao Sages, Divine Lord Peacock was a talent.
 Han Jue wanted to test him. He directly used the Dark Nightmare and faced Divine Lord Peacock in the image of the Dark Forbidden Lord. The dream was above the Yellow Spring. The two of them floated in the air. Divine Lord Peacock wore a gorgeous embroidered robe and a seven-colored feather wind. He had a handsome face, and his crown was embedded with the head of a peacock. He was handsome and domineering. Especially his eyes, they were very sharp and cold.
 He stared at Han Jue and asked, “Who are you? What a Mystical Power. You actually pulled me into the dream directly and I didn’t sense anything.” Han Jue asked, “You’re also impressive. You have a Supreme Treasure that can block curses.” Divine Lord Peacock narrowed his eyes and exclaimed, “Dark Forbidden Lord!”
 Han Jue didn’t deny it. He wanted to show his cards.
 He had read Divine Lord Peacock’s information and did not know the word Chan School. In addition, he had a Supreme Treasure that even the Heavenly Lord of Primordial Beginning did not have. He might have only been invited.
 “I’m very interested in you. You can even curse the Chaotic Deity to death. Your appearance has broken the long-standing stability of the Chaos. Come out and fight me!” Divine Lord Peacock said with a burning gaze. Han Jue teased, “Are you the Chaotic Deity’s match?”
 “Yes, he lost.”
 “Then, how dare you challenge me?” “I like to challenge experts!” Divine Lord Peacock’s eyes burned as his powerful aura erupted, causing the dream to twist violently. Han Jue asked, “Why are you working for the Heavenly Lord of Primordial Beginning?” Divine Lord Peacock said, “I’m not working for him. I’m only here to add insult to injury to the Heavenly Dao.” To add insult to injury? Han Jue didn’t expect him to confess so easily. Divine Lord Peacock smiled mockingly and said, “The living beings of the Chaos are all from the Heavenly Dao. I’m the same.
 However, after the Dao Ancestor attained the Dao, he ruled over the Heavenly Dao and Sage positions alone. All the Sages were his disciples. The Sages in the future are also inheritors of the Dao Sect. Even if all living beings have outstanding potential and monstrous providence, they are still suppressed by the Dao Ancestor.
 “After the Dao Ancestor fused with the Dao, he became equivalent to the Heavenly Dao. He used the Heavenly Dao Immeasurable Calamity to expel us Pseudo-Sages from the Heavenly Dao and we struggled to survive in the Chaos. He controlled the Heavenly Dao like this and made it impossible for it to escape the Dao Sect’s hands. As time passed, the Sages became dissatisfied. “Although we are grateful for his teaching, there’s no need for us to serve him forever, right?
 The reason why I want to destroy the Heavenly Dao now is to create a new Heavenly Dao. The Heavenly Lord of Primordial Beginning convinced me, so I came. I know the reason he came to me is that I’m not afraid of curses.” Divine Lord Peacock stared at him, his eyes becoming more and more excited and even a little fanatical.
 Han Jue couldn’t stand this gaze. This fellow was too confident!
 Divine Lord Peacock’s words allowed Han Jue to understand the Dao Ancestor from another perspective.
 It had to be said that the Dao Ancestor was indeed a little domineering.
 If Han Jue was one of those Sages and was forever inferior to the Dao Ancestor, he wouldn’t be able to take it.
 Han Jue thought of the Hidden Sect. The Dao Ancestor’s betrayal was worth being wary of. Fortunately, the Hidden Sect did not have any territory or benefits for the disciples to fight for. Compared to the Dao Ancestor, Han Jue’s desire for power was very low. He rarely let his disciples help him and wouldn’t restrict their development.
 Divine Lord Peacock snorted. “Dark Forbidden Lord, come. Fight me! I want to see how strong you are!”
 “The difference in cultivation level between us is too great. You can’t be my match. You’re not even worth me showing my face.”
 “In that case, why did you visit me in my dreams?” Divine Lord Peacock mocked.
 Han Jue asked, “What are you pursuing?” He had a Great Dao Purple Qi in his hand and could even transform a person into a Chaotic Fiendcelestial. This was his topic of conversation. Divine Lord Peacock smiled. “You want to subdue
 me?”
 “Is it impossible?” “There are many people who want to subdue me. Back then, the Dao Ancestor also wanted to take me in, but I rejected him. It’s precisely because of this that I’ll never have the chance to attain the Great Dao.”
 “What if I can let you attain the Great Dao?”
 While Divine Lord Peacock was still mocking, his words stunned him. Han Jue wasn’t in a hurry and waited patiently.
 He couldn’t help but check Divine Lord Peacock’s information again.
 [Divine Lord Peacock: Perfected Freedom Sage, Immeasurable Emperor, Demon Saint, Great Dao Mystical Power Inheritor] Great Dao Mystical Power Inheritor! Could he be the Kong Xuan of the Investiture of the Gods?
 Is this Mystical Power the Five-Colored Divine Light? In the Investiture of the Gods, Kong Xuan’s Five-Colored Divine Light could even defeat Sages. “Hmph, defeat me first. I can prove my potential to you!”
 The surrounding dream shattered like a mirror. He forcefully broke through the dream realm! In the Daoist temple, Han Jue opened his eyes. [Divine Lord Peacock has a favorable impression of you. Current favorability: 3 stars] Han Jue originally thought that Divine Lord Peacock was angry, but he didn’t expect him to have a favorable impression of him.
 Was this arrogance?
 Han Jue didn’t immediately go out to challenge Divine Lord Peacock. That would expose his relationship with the Dark Forbidden Lord.
Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com However, he could also tell from the dream that Divine Lord Peacock and the Heavenly Lord of Primordial Beginning were not completely tied together. He continued cultivating. When he broke through to the late stage of the Freedom Primordial Chaos, Han Jue felt that he should be able to insta-kill Divine Lord Peacock. Han Jue still had this confidence. You, Divine Lord Peacock, claim to have unparalleled potential, but are you comparable to the Primordial Fiendcelestial?
 Dark Forbidden Zone.
 Han Tuo and Yi Tian quickly traveled with tens of thousands of Heavenly Court immortals. Their current selves had already been reborn. The spirit of an expert could be seen with the naked eye.
 They wore armor and their capes fluttered, looking majestic. Han Tuo’s eyes sharpened as he said, “We’re getting closer and closer to the Heavenly Dao. Prepare for battle at any time! “Kill them whenever you see them!”
 The tens of thousands of Heavenly Court immortals acknowledged softly. These immortals were all recruited by the Evil Heavenly Emperor from the various Little Heavenly Dao. Their cultivation levels were at least Grand Unity True Immortal, and they had extremely strong foundations. Han Tuo and Yi Tian were even experts who dominated the Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm.
 Yi Tian suddenly smiled and said, “It’s been a long time since we returned to the Heavenly Dao. If we succeed, shouldn’t the Heavenly Dao Sages thank?us?”
 Han Tuo shook his head. “You’re thinking too much. Our Heavenly Court is only restraining the Calamity Race and won’t be of much use.” Yi Tian chuckled. “It’s fine. There’s a mighty figure behind us. I wonder where His Majesty persuaded him to come. Tsk tsk, that aura is really terrifying.”
