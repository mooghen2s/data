 Han Jue was almost annoyed to death.
 Was there something wrong with this dog?
 Wait!
 Could it be that the Demon Emperor had already guessed that he was the Dark Forbidden Lord?
 Terrified, Han Jue hurriedly used the derivation function to ask if the Demon Emperor knew that he was the Dark Forbidden Lord.
 After deducting 100 million years of his lifespan, he learned that the Demon Emperor did not know that he was the Dark Forbidden Lord.
 It seemed like he had other motives.
 Han Jue didn’t dare to have any contact with the Demon Emperor, lest he was found out.
nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎 He continued to cultivate.
 After reaching the Rank Eight Immortal Emperor Realm, as his absorption speed increased, his cultivation speed also increased greatly.
 At this rate, he would soon reach the Rank Nine Immortal Emperor Realm.
 After reaching the Deity Realm, Han Jue would definitely devour the negative karma and advance by leaps and bounds.
 Han Jue was looking forward to it.
 Time passed quickly in the Nine Nether Purgatory, because there was nothing here. There was only endless negative karma, and not many incidents occurred.
 To the Hidden Sect, it was no different from the past.
 The Hidden Sect Competition that occurred once every hundred years continued. This matter was handled by Murong Qi. After all, he was the War God.
 Duan Hongchen and Black Hell Demon Lord also participated. Unfortunately, they couldn’t defeat Diamond Rage.
 Although Liu Bei had the body of the Victorious Fighting Buddha, his soul and body had not fused enough. He couldn’t defeat Black Hell Demon Lord, who was also a Rank Five Immortal Emperor.
 This might change in the future.
 Among the disciples, Li Yao was the first.
 It was worth mentioning that she had already grasped the fourth level of the Heavenly Sword Dao, the Immortal Slaying Sword Formation. Unfortunately, only one of her swords was very strong.
 Dao Comprehension Sword had just comprehended the third level, Sword Creates the Primordial World, but it was already quite good.
 The other disciples also improved.
 The most shocking was naturally Chu Shiren. After accepting Lu Huaxu as his disciple, he cultivated seriously and pulled away from Lu Huaxu and Zhou Mingyue. He had already reached the Grand Unity True Immortal Realm first. Even Xun Chang’an had been surpassed by him.
 The weakest was definitely the Chaotic Heavenly Dog. Back then, its eyes had been gouged out and its providence had been stolen, causing it to take a long time to recover.
 The Black Hell Chicken was not bad. It had already reached the Grand Unity Heaven Immortal Realm.
 In short, the entire Hidden Sect was improving at an extremely fast speed. After the calamity ended, everyone would probably be experts who could dominate an area of the Immortal World.
 Thirty years passed in the blink of an eye.
 Han Jue put down the Book of Misfortune with satisfaction.
 Every ten years, if he did not curse his enemies, he would feel uncomfortable, as if his life was missing something. Han Jue was about to continue cultivating when someone disturbed him.
 Golden Crow Token, Jiang Yi.
 Han Jue connected with his divine sense and asked, “Are you saved?”
 Jiang Yi smiled and said, “I’m saved. It was a blessing in disguise. My cultivation level has also increased greatly. I’m now a Rank Three Immortal Emperor.”
 “Amazing.”
 “Of course!”
 Jiang Yi’s tone was filled with smugness. How many years had he been in the Emperor Realm?
 Han Jue asked, “Is there anything else?”
 Jiang Yi smiled and said, “Come to the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End. I’ve already…”
 Han Jue directly cut off the divine sense connection.
 Crazy!
 Trying to trick me after just being saved?
 At this moment, Jiang Yi’s divine sense fluctuation came from the Golden Crow Token again. Han Jue connected to it.
 “Brat! How can you be so rude!” Jiang Yi roared.
 Han Jue said coldly, “What kind of fortuitous encounter do you want to trick me into looking for again? You clearly have a hard time, but you still want to scam a friend.”
 Friend!
 Jiang Yi felt awkward hearing that.
 Speaking of which, he had indeed lived a miserable life in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End all these years. But how did Han Jue know?
 I’ve only asked for help once.
 Jiang Yi said in a low voice, “I’m not lying to you this time. If you come to the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End, you can avoid the Immeasurable Calamity.”
 Hearing this, Han Jue asked in confusion, “Why?”
 “I’m not sure, either. This is my first time here. I heard that the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End is not under the jurisdiction of the Heavenly Dao.”
 “Then, why don’t all the living beings in the Immortal World go there?”
 “We have to cross the Dark Forbidden Zone. It’s extremely dangerous. Even an Immortal Emperor is not completely safe.”
 Han Jue raised his eyebrows.
 This is a high-level map?
 Jiang Yi said, “However, the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End is not as lively as the Immortal World. There is also insufficient Immortal Qi and even fewer opportunities. Those below the Emperor Realm will not be able to escape death if they come here. But you are different. You should be an Immortal Emperor already. In any case, you don’t want to enter the calamity.”
 Han Jue replied, “Thank you for your kind intentions. I’m hiding in an extremely safe place now and can’t enter the calamity.” “Impossible! As long as you’re under the Heavenly Dao, you will definitely enter the calamity.”
 “We’ll see.”
 “Really?”
 “Mm.”
 “Then tell me a story.”
 “I’m not free. That’s all. We’ll talk next time.”
 Han Jue directly severed his divine sense connection.
 I wasn’t as strong as you last time, so I had to entertain you.
 Now you want me to tell you another story?
 Countless years later, if news of this spread, it would probably embarrass the Dark Forbidden Lord!
 Jiang Yi didn’t disturb Han Jue anymore, and he continued cultivating.
 In a bright Daoist temple, Long Hao was meditating
 His condition was extremely strange. His face twitched, with half of it emitting golden light.
 He suddenly opened his eyes, which shone brightly.
 He began to pant.
 Whoosh
 Long Hao looked down at his hands and then stood up to size up his body. He was overjoyed.
 “Success. As expected of the son of the Heavenly Emperor with the strongest potential. He’s somewhat similar to me.” Long Hao smiled in satisfaction.
 It was Hao Tian!
 Possession succeeded!
 He suppressed Long Hao’s soul and forcefully controlled his body.
 Hao Tian walked out of the Daoist temple. There was a huge lake outside. The sky was colored with green mountains and rivers. It was as beautiful as a painting.
 He came to the lake and admired the scene before him.
 How many years had it been?
 He finally saw the world with his own eyes.
 At this moment, a figure appeared by his side. It was a Dao Child.
 The Dao Child said, “Master wants you to go. The disciples of the Jie School are here this time. You can’t be missing.”
 Hao Tian glanced at the Dao Child and nodded with a smile.
 “Hmph, Jie School, Chan School, I want to capture all of you at once!”
 Killing intent flashed across Hao Tian’s eyes very subtly.
 Another ten years had passed since he had contacted Jiang Yi.
 Han Jue cursed as he checked his emails regularly.
 He suddenly saw an email and frowned.
 (Your disciple Long Hao has been possessed. His soul has been suppressed.]
 Han Jue hurriedly checked his interpersonal relationships and discovered that Long Hao’s information had the word “possessed”.
 Ridiculous!
 Hao Tian was courting death!
 Han Jue immediately stopped cursing the Demon Emperor and changed it to cursing Hao Tian.
 Five days later.
 Han Jue continued to curse with his lifespan while staring at the emails, afraid that Long Hao would also die.
 After about a hundred million years of lifespan were deducted.
 (Because of your curse, your disciple Long Hao’s Dharmic powers are in chaos. His body is on the verge of collapse, and Hao Tian’s soul is suffering a backlash. Long Hao has taken control of his body.]
 Han Jue immediately stopped.
 Long Hao was too weak, causing Hao Tian to be in a tough spot as well.
 Han Jue frowned. What should he do?
 Hao Tian was like a time bomb that could threaten Long Hao at any time.
 Han Jue couldn’t deal with Hao Tian personally and could only plot against him remotely.
 No.
 He had to contact the Heavenly Emperor. However, Han Jue couldn’t contact him now. It would easily expose his identity. He would wait another ten years.
