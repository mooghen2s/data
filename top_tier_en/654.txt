 “Hehe.”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du didn’t want to talk to him. Although Li Muyi made him unhappy, the Human School had lost its face, after all. He didn’t want to mention it lest it hurt Han Jue’s relationship with him. Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said seriously, “This child is not simple. He was a Freedom Sage in his previous life and died when he tried to break through to the Great Dao in the Chaos. He’s a Connate lifeform with the highest potential. He might even reach the potential of a Chaotic Fiendcelestial in the future.”
 Han Jue asked in surprise, “If he’s so powerful, why are you giving him to me?” “Because he doesn’t submit to me. In the Heavenly Dao, only you can subdue him.” “Why do we have to subdue him?” “He has too many enemies in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End. I want to rope him into the Heavenly Dao, but he holds it in disdain. Fellow Daoist Han, this child values relationships. Once he acknowledges you, he will definitely not leave the Heavenly Dao.”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du stared at Han Jue and said helplessly. The current Heavenly Dao was weak. If he did not rope in some geniuses from the outside world and relied on himself to develop, it would be too slow.
 Han Jue thought for a moment and said, “Alright, where is he?” Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “When he comes, I’ll tell him to go to the Hundred Peak Immortal River to find you.”
 “Alright!”
 Han Jue and Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du chatted about the Reincarnation Space again. Although he had already successfully grasped the Earth Immortal World, Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du did not plan to give up on the Reincarnation Space. Immortal Emperor Samsara and the disciples of the Human School who controlled the Reincarnation Space would use the providence of the Earth Immortal World to attain the Dao. There would only be two Heavenly Dao Sages in the Earth Immortal World. This was Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du’s guarantee to Han Jue.
 Not only that, but the other Sage Sects were also not allowed to enter the Earth Immortal World. Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du and Han Jue were only separated by the Earth Immortal World. Han Jue was very satisfied with this. If Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du was really impartial, Han Jue would suspect him.
 No matter how powerful an existence was, they would still want benefits. You couldn’t see it, but the difference in cultivation realm was huge. After chatting, Han Jue returned to the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 He sent his consciousness into the Primordial World in his body. Great Loose Heaven’s transformation process was about to end smoothly.
 Han Jue hoped that the Heavenly Dao would reduce the tribulation and give him time to develop.
 More than six hundred years later.
 A man appeared outside the Hundred Peak Immortal River. He wore a blue robe and looked imposing. The arrogance that emitted from his bones was very obvious.
 “I am Guan Bubai. I’m recommended by Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du to visit the Sect Master of the Hidden Sect,” the blue-robed man said. His voice spread throughout the Hundred Peak Immortal River, waking all the disciples. Han Jue was busy cultivating in seclusion and didn’t pay attention to him immediately.
 After waiting for a day, Guan Bubai was furious and immediately rushed to the Universal Hall outside the 33rd Heaven.
 Seeing Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du, he asked, “Why is that Immeasurable Merit Divine Might Heavenly Sage ignoring me?” Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du had a headache. “He likes to enter seclusion for a thousand years every time. Previously, when I looked for him, I had to wait until his seclusion ended.”
 Guan Bubai frowned; “Why is this person so pretentious?”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du closed his eyes.
 Han Jue entered seclusion for another thousand years. Unknowingly, he was already 170,000 years old.
 Time truly did not spare anyone. In the blink of an eye, the stars had shifted.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and moved the champion, who had been waiting outside the Hundred Peak Immortal River for ten years, into his Dao Field. More than three hundred years ago, Han Jue knew that Guan Bubai came. At that time, it even caused a system notification. [Detected bearer of Connate providence, check its origin.) Seeing this notification, Han Jue sighed. It had been a long time! He checked the information again. (Guan Bubai: Late-stage Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm, Freedom Reincarnation, Connate lifeform, Invincible Heart, Chaotic Profound Technique. In his previous life, he was attacked when he was attempting to break through to the Great Dao Dao Fruit and had no choice but to reincarnate as a remnant soul.)
 Han Jue wasn’t looking forward to Guan Bubai, to begin with, so he didn’t break his own cultivation rule for this. It was a good opportunity to suppress him. At that time, the words that Guan Bubai said sounded extremely conceited. With such a personality, if he really acknowledged Han Jue as his master, he might cause many troubles in the future.
 Guan Bubai opened his eyes and discovered that he had arrived at a Daoist temple. His gaze landed on Han Jue, who was covered in divine light and looked extremely mysterious. He curled his lips slightly. How pretentious! This guy was even better at pretending than him! Guan Bubai had been wandering around the Immortal World for the past few years and didn’t expect to return and wait for another ten years. He was a little dissatisfied with Han Jue. He did not speak. Han Jue didn’t say anything, either. The Daoist temple fell silent and the atmosphere was awkward. In the end, Guan Bubai couldn’t help but ask, “What do you mean? Xuan Du didn’t tell you clearly?” Han Jue smiled. “Calling him Xuan Du by name, it seems that you don’t care about Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du. In that case, why do you want to become my disciple?” Guan Bubai said, “No matter how strong Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du is, he’s only at the Freedom Realm. I was also at this realm in my previous life and was of the same generation as him. As for why I wanted to acknowledge you as my master, it’s because you’re a Chaotic Fiendcelestial. The Great Dao Realm is not difficult for you to attain.”
 Han Jue raised his eyebrows. From the sound of it, it was very easy for a Chaotic Fiendcelestial to become a Great Dao Sage. At least, this had already spread. Guan Bubai believed it firmly. Han Jue said, “You can acknowledge me as your master. From now on, you can only stay in my Dao Field. You are not allowed to leave without my orders.”
 Guan Bubai said, “Alright, but I have to make one thing clear. Once I reach the Freedom Realm, I have to leave and pursue my Great Dao. In the future, if I attain the Great Dao, I will still acknowledge you as my master. As long as you don’t go against my principles, you can entrust anything to me.”
 His tone was neither humble nor servile. It was as if he was discussing a cooperation with Han Jue. Han Jue reached out and sucked Guan Bubai in front of him, directly using Absolute Purification on him.
 Guan Bubai said in a low voice, “What do you mean?”
 He couldn’t break free from Han Jue’s Dharmic powers and couldn’t move, so he was a little flustered.
 After all, he was only a Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal now!
 Han Jue said calmly, “You fled from the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End. I’m worried that you have other mighty figures’ tricks on you. I’ll help you eliminate them. Don’t worry. If I wanted to kill you, I wouldn’t go to so much trouble.” Guan Bubai heaved a sigh of relief.
 After the Absolute Purification ended, Han Jue let Li Xuan’ao arrange a residence and opened the authority of the simulation trial for Guan Bubai. At this point, Han Jue had another disciple. When the personal disciples learned of this, they came to visit Guan Bubai. However, he directly entered seclusion and did not see them. This made the personal disciples unhappy. Li Xuan’ao said meaningfully, “This new disciple is at the late stage of the Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm.”CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m
