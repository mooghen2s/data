 Li Xuan’ao instructed. The Four Chaotic Monkeys were known to be ruthless.
 The Long-arm Ape was the overlord of a mountain before. It was domineering. Li Xuan’ao was worried that it couldn’t control its personality.
 Hearing this, the Long-arm Ape nodded desperately. He wasn’t stupid. Before he knew Li Xuan’ao, he had heard of the Hundred Peak Immortal River. He was already very happy to be able to join the Hidden Sect.
 Just like that, Li Xuan’ao accepted the Long-arm Ape as his disciple. He brought it around the Hundred Peak Immortal River and let the Hidden Sect disciples meet it.
 The disciples of the Hidden Sect did not have a good impression of the Long-arm Ape. It was only because this fellow was not good-looking and they were busy cultivating and had no time to interact.
 The addition of the Long-arm Ape did not affect the cultivation culture of the Hidden Sect.
 The Hundred Peak Immortal River was still silent.
 Time flew.
 Four hundred years passed.
 Han Jue cursed Zhou Quan for another day.
 Liu Bei suddenly brought a Qilin to visit. It was Xu Lin, who had the bloodline of the Qilin
 King.
 Xu Lin had already reached the Grand Unity Golden Immortal Realm. The man and the Qilin knelt in front of Han Jue.
 Xu Lin had yet to transform. His figure was like a tiger and was slightly smaller than before. He was probably controlling his body size.
 Han Jue stared at him. That gaze brought great pressure to Xu Lin, making him not dare to look up.
 Liu Bei was the first to speak, “Master, what do you plan to do next?”
 Han Jue said, “You can leave first. I’ll teach him for a period of time.”
 Liu Bei nodded and left.
 Xu Lin shivered, not knowing what to think.
 Han Jue said, “Don’t be nervous. Cultivate next to me. Cultivate according to the previous cultivation method. This is not a test.”
 He raised his hand and waved, causing a mat to appear beside him.
 Immediately after, Han Jue raised his finger and pointed at Xu Lin, directly turning him into a human.
 Xu Lin transformed into a young man with an ordinary appearance, an ordinary figure, and a stunned expression.
 Seeing Han Jue close his eyes, although he was puzzled, he could only suppress it and enter his cultivation state.
 At first, Xu Lin was very nervous, but as time passed, his nervousness was also wiped away.
 A hundred years passed.
 Xu Lin walked out of the Daoist temple. The sunlight shone on him, making him feel as if a lifetime had passed.
 He took a deep breath and clenched his fists.
 His eyes became extremely confident and his back straightened.
 “As expected of the master of the Hidden Sect. This is the Great Dao?”
 Xu Lin was excited. He quickened his pace and prepared to return to cultivate diligently.
 Not long after he left, Li Xuan’ao came to the Daoist temple and wanted to visit Han Jue.
 “What is it?”
 Han Jue didn’t let him in and asked directly. Li Xuan’ao said, “Sect Master, Long-arm Ape…”
 “You’re in charge of teaching and can also teach the Great Dao yourself.”
 Han Jue’s voice floated out, causing Li Xuan’ao to be overjoyed.
 He wanted to teach the Great Dao to the Long-arm Ape, thinking that he had to seek Han Jue’s approval first.
 Li Xuan’ao bowed and left.
 Han Jue covered the Dao Field with his divine sense and observed the Nether Race.
 The Nether Race was the threshold of the Hidden Sect. Their potential was high, but they were not top-notch.
 Now, the ten thousand Nether Race members had already begun to break through to the Deity Realm.
 When they stepped into the Deity Realm, the strength of the Hidden Sect would increase again.
 Han Jue couldn’t help but look at the second-generation disciples. He called Xun Chang’an over.
 As his third disciple, Xun Chang’an’s cultivation was inferior to that of a third-generation disciple. However, under the powerful torrent of the Hidden Sect, he could barely keep up with the main group.
 However, he was only a Rank Four Immortal Emperor now. How pathetic.
 Xun Chang’an knelt in front of Han Jue. He wasn’t nervous when facing him. After all, they had been together for more than twenty thousand years.
 Han Jue asked, “Are you satisfied with your cultivation?”
 Xun Chang’an frowned and hesitated for a moment before saying, “If I say that I’m satisfied, actually, I’m not that satisfied. But I’m not that unsatisfied, either.”
 Han Jue cursed silently.
 What ugly words from an ugly monk!
 Although Xun Chang’an was no longer ugly or even rather handsome, his nickname was still Ugly Monk.
 Han Jue cursed. “Speak normally!”
 Xun Chang’an shivered and said, “It means that I can become stronger. It doesn’t matter if I can’t. In any case, I’ve always been in the Hidden Sect. Even if I don’t have any enemies, I still have your protection.”
 “Then, don’t you want to protect me?”
 “Master, you’re so strong. How can I chase after you? Even if you let Li Daokong say this, can he be confident?”
 Xun Chang’an was very innocent and aggrieved.
 Han Jue remained silent.
 That made sense.
 Han Jue didn’t want the day to really need his disciple’s protection.
 But he wouldn’t allow his disciples to slack off!
 “I will personally preach the Dao to you. In five thousand years, you must reach the Rank Nine Immortal Emperor Realm.” Han Jue snorted.
 Xun Chang’an’s expression collapsed. Crossing that many realms in five thousand years?
 Impossible!
 He had already stepped into the Emperor Realm for more than ten thousand years and was only a Rank Four Immortal Emperor.
 Han Jue ignored Xun Chang’an and started to preach.
 In the forest, a stone tower stood.
 In the tower, the Three Immortals of Qu Jun were napping in boredom.
 Snake Head Immortal said weakly, “Brother, how long do we have to wait? Those who came after the Long-arm Ape have already entered the Hidden Sect. How long do we have to wait?”
F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com He repeated it twice, clearly confused.
 Eagle Head Immortal snorted. “Continue waiting! Those with ambitions will succeed. This is what a mighty figure who taught me said.”
 The third Great Immortal did not speak.
 At this moment.
 A voice sounded, “Are you the Three Immortals of Qu Jun?”
 The three immortals immediately sat up and saw the Earth God who had confronted Han Zuitian.
 He held his head high and said proudly, “I’m the envoy sent by the Heavenly Race to confer the title of Earth God to you three. Aren’t you going to kneel down and receive the title?”
 The three immortals were stunned, and they looked at each other.
 Eagle Head Immortal was the first to recover. He cursed. “Get lost!”
 The other two immortals also revealed fierce expressions.
 The Earth God was stunned. “Can’t I give you the Hundred Peak Immortal River? Are you worried about the Hidden Sect? Don’t worry, the Heavenly Race will soon move it away. At that time…”
 Eagle Head Immortal attacked directly. His right hand transformed into an eagle claw and quickly stretched out, shooting straight at the Earth God’s throat.
 The Earth God was shocked and immediately fled.
 In an instant, he arrived thousands of kilometers away.
 Then, he emerged from the ground and cursed. “Three fools! I gave you a chance, but you’re useless!”
 At this moment, a demonic wind blew.
 “Where are you running to!”
 “Killing him will definitely be a contribution to the Hundred Peak Immortal River!”
 “Hahaha, this is a rare opportunity!”
 The three immortals’ voices floated over. They were very excited.
 Earth God vomited blood. He didn’t understand why these three dogs were so loyal to the Hidden Sect when they were not accepted by the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 Not having time to think, he continued to escape.
 “I’m the Earth God. Can the three of you capture me?”
 Deep underground, the Earth God thought disdainfully as he traveled quickly.
 Several days later.
 The three immortals appeared near the Hundred Peak Immortal River. Eagle Head Immortal waved his sleeve, and the Earth God tied up by the golden rope was thrown to the ground. He was covered in dust and had disheveled hair, looking extremely pathetic.
 Eagle Head Immortal shouted, “Seniors of the Hidden Sect, we have caught a spy sent by the Heavenly Race! He wants to harm the Hidden Sect!”
