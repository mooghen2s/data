 Recently, his circle of friends had been very calm. Nothing special had happened.
 Not bad. Long live peace.
 Han Jue thought silently.
 He paid attention to Han Tuo again. With his current cultivation, the entire Immortal World was in his eyes. He didn’t even need to use his Mystical Power to see the other party at a glance.
 This kid had recently fought with the Jie School and had suffered a lot.
 Of course, he was only interacting with the lowest level, but it was enough to make him despair.
Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m Han Jue waved his right hand expressionlessly.
 A stream of Sage powers landed on Han Tuo’s body, causing the bloodline restriction to loosen again. He would show greater potential, but it was still far from his true bloodline potential.
 “In life, opportunities and benefactors are indispensable. My benefactor is the system, and your benefactor is me.”
 Han Jue thought silently and smiled slightly.
 He looked forward to Han Tuo’s rise.
 In a palace on the 13th Heaven.
 Ji Xianshen sat on a throne, and his gaze landed on a person in the hall.
 It was Jing Tiangong of the Jie School!
 Ji Xianshen asked, “Senior, why are you looking for me?”
 He didn’t have a good impression of Jing Tiangong because he was from the Jie School. Although he had lost his position as the Sect Master, he still belonged to the Jie School.
 Jing Tiangong raised his hand and took out a golden token. It floated in the air and emitted a light that illuminated the hall.
 Ji Xianshen frowned.
 Jing Tiangong smiled and said, “A little trick to prevent the Sages from spying.”
 Ji Xianshen narrowed his eyes. “It seems that you want to abandon the Jie School.”
 Jing Tiangong replied, “I’ll tell you directly. I follow the Dark Forbidden Lord and not the Jie School. After the calamity ended, the Forbidden Lord did not appear again. However, he said that when the world falls into darkness, he will appear. “Heavenly Ancestor, I understand your dilemma. Aren’t you looking for a backing to join the Dark Forbidden Lord’s forces?
 “The reason why the Heavenly Race could be born is that the Dark Forbidden Lord interfered with the calamity. The Sages were helpless to stop him.”
 Jing Tiangong’s tone was filled with pride when he mentioned the Dark Forbidden Lord.
 It was as if he was the Dark Forbidden Lord himself!
 Ji Xianshen asked calmly, “I don’t even know who the Dark Forbidden Lord is. Besides, in the previous calamity, the Dark Forbidden Lord did not win. What does the future hold by following him?”
 Jing Tiangong smiled. “Did he really not succeed? The original calamity should have lasted for many years. It was enough for the disciples of the various Sage Sects to rise. However, because of the Dark Forbidden Lord, the calamity only lasted for thousands of years. If you think about the current situation, no Sage Sect can dominate alone.
 “This is why the Dark Forbidden Lord is so powerful. He doesn’t want to fight at all. He just wants to balance the Immortal World!”
 Hearing this, Ji Xianshen frowned again.
 I see.
 No wonder the Dark Forbidden Lord only cursed people and did not say that he wanted to fight.
 Ji Xianshen began to ponder if he should join the Dark Forbidden Lord.
 Currently, the Sages would no longer allow him to join because he was the Heavenly Ancestor and needed him to face the Heavenly Dao. If he was absorbed, it would cause the entire sect to face the Heavenly Dao together.
 Since ancient times, the factions with the greatest providence in the Heavenly Dao during peaceful times were often the sinful factions that needed to be defeated in the next calamity!
 Jing Tiangong said, “Join the Dark Forbidden Lord. You need to lie low and wait patiently. I will also use my strength to help you build momentum and help you rope in forces.”
 Ji Xianshen asked, “Your power is from the Jie School?”
 Jing Tiangong shook his head.
 He smiled disdainfully and said, “Jie School? I gave the position of Sect Master to a fool because I wanted the Jie School to be destroyed. In the calamity, I expelled many disciples. Actually, the ones who were expelled were my trusted aides.”
 Ji Xianshen asked, “You were born in the sect. Why do you hate the Jie School?”
 Jing Tiangong said, “It’s not easy to tell you about this. The reason why you can rise is actually related to a person called Han Jue, right? The Heavenly Emperor favored Han Jue and helped you out. Heavenly Emperor Fang, who is on good terms with you, is even his grand-disciple. Han Jue seems to be from the Hidden Sect. The Sages are targeting the Hidden Sect, and you are also implicated. You can only follow the path of the Dark Forbidden Lord. Otherwise, you won’t be well next and might even become a joke in the Immortal World.”
 Ji Xianshen was moved. He knew that what Jing Tiangong said was true.
 Han Jue’s existence was the most important reason why the Sages rejected him.
 However, he wouldn’t blame Han Jue. If not for him, how could he be where he was today?
 Ji Xianshen fell silent.
 Jing Tiangong wasn’t in a hurry. He waited patiently.
 Another five hundred years passed. Han Jue’s cultivation increased very slowly. He was far from the mid-stage Primordial Chaos Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm. After all, he was at the Sage Realm!
 In the past few years, the Hidden Sect disciples had all improved. The personal disciples had also stepped into the Deity Realm one after another. Even Fairy Xi Xuan and Chang Yue’er were the same.
 A Deity Realm cultivator below 40,000 years old was considered a prodigy. It was mainly because of the Dao Field and Han Jue’s Dao preaching!
 Han Jue also paid attention to Han Tuo’s cultivation. This kid had already stepped into the Immortal Realm. It wasn’t fast or slow.
 It was fine as long as he was alive.
 On this day.
 “I’m Shi Dudao. I created my own Invincible Dao. Anyone who can cross realms to kill enemies can enter the Invincible Dao. I can sweep through the Immortal World and fight for providence with Sages and compete with the heavens!”
 A domineering voice resounded throughout the Immortal World.
 Han Jue couldn’t help but open his eyes.
 Invincible Dao?
 Why did it sound so ridiculous…
 However, it had to be said that Shi Dudao’s slogan was very loud. Fighting for providence with the Sages and competing with the heavens!
 Who wouldn’t feel their blood boil?
 Han Jue was very interested in Shi Dudao. After all, he had copied him to form several Dao Field guards.
 It seemed that Shi Dudao wanted to challenge the teachings of the Sages. He didn’t know if he could succeed.
 (Dao Field guard has successfully copied. Please give him a name.)
 A line of words appeared in front of him.
 A figure appeared in front of Han Jue. It was Li Muyi.
 As expected of a Sage-level guard, it took so long to copy it!
 Han Jue stared at Li Muyi and fell into deep thought.
 What should I call you?
 Taking the names of the three countries meant that Li Muyi was on the same level as the other guards.
 Forget it, let’s just follow the Three Kingdoms. Tradition cannot change. Han Jue thought for a moment and said, “Let’s call it Zhang Jue!”
 The Dao Field guard knelt down and replied, “Thank you for the name, Master!”
 Han Jue said softly, “Cultivate in front of my Daoist temple.”
 Zhang Jue agreed and left.
 He walked out of the Daoist temple and sat in front of the door like a door guardian.
 The crimson fox not far away was stunned. Who was this person?
 It had never seen Li Muyi before. It was extremely surprised to see him walk out of the Daoist temple.
 It carefully went over to strike up a conversation, but Zhang Jue ignored it.
 Outside the 33rd Heaven.
 Li Muyi, who was meditating, suddenly opened his eyes. He frowned with a strange expression.
 “Why do I suddenly feel uneasy?” Li Muyi muttered to himself. He pinched his fingers to deduce, but he couldn’t find anything.
 He couldn’t deduce it!
 Ever since the Dark Forbidden Lord and Han Jue rose, he often encountered things that he couldn’t predict!
 It didn’t make sense.
 It did not make sense!
 Could this be the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity that the Dao Ancestor had mentioned?
 The Sage’s Tribulation?
