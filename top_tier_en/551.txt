 He didn’t want to be tied to the Heavenly Dao.
 He needed to support a Sage to monopolize the Heavenly’s providence Dao and control it for him.
 Having another idea, Han Jue asked, “Can I use the Primordial Heavenly Prison to enslave a Heavenly Dao Sage and control the Heavenly Dao?”
 (Ten billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 (You can enslave a Heavenly Dao Sage, but you can’t control the Heavenly Dao because of this. The Heavenly Dao will automatically sever the Sage’s providence.]
 Han Jue wasn’t surprised.
 The Heavenly Dao was a rule, after all. No matter how strong the system was, could it be stronger than the Great Dao?
 Even the Great Dao couldn’t directly devour the Heavenly Dao!
 Moreover, enslaving a Heavenly Dao Sage would definitely offend an even higher existence.
 From what Han Jue knew so far, the Heavenly Dao had already had more than ten Immeasurable Calamities. During these Immeasurable Calamities, many mighty figures had risen. The Sages had also been changed. Those Transcendent Dao Experts had left the Heavenly Dao and moved to the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End.
 If Jade Bodhi could sense the Heavenly Dao’s situation, so could the other Transcendent Dao Experts.
 To put it bluntly, these Sages were puppets planted by the Great Dao Sages in the Heavenly Dao.
 Han Jue wanted to control the Heavenly Dao in the dark!
 This was foolproof!
 Outside the 33rd Heaven.
 Sage Dao Field. Qiu Xilai sat on the golden lotus. His expression changed as wisps of strange and ancient gray Qi wrapped around his body.
 He suddenly opened his eyes and shouted angrily. The surrounding gray aura vanished.
 A black shadow appeared in front of him.
 Qiu Xilai stared at him and said in a low voice, “What do you want!”
 The black shadow said, “The Heavenly Dao is weak. This is your opportunity. I want to ask you, what do you want?”
 Qiu Xilai was silent.
 The black shadow continued, “Li Muyi’s Chiliocosm World is about to be devoured by the Dark Sage King. His next target is the Heavenly Dao. If you unite the Heavenly Dao, you can better welcome the Dark Sage King’s attack.”
 “Who is the Dark Sage King?”
 “The Karma Evil Spirit born in the Dark Forbidden Zone. He wants to devour the Big and Small Heavenly Dao and transcend the Great Dao to resist the ancient order.”
 “Why aren’t you attacking?”.
 “How can we attack with the Realm Lord around? The Heavenly Dao and the Great Dao cannot interfere with each other. This is an iron rule that cannot be violated.”
 Qiu Xilai fell silent.
 The black shadow vanished into thin air after saying, “You have to unite the Heavenly Dao before the next calamity. Otherwise, your Sage position will go to someone else.”
 Qiu Xilai’s eyes flickered with dissatisfaction.
 Fifty years later.

 Han Jue frowned.
 The Heavenly Emperor had transformed into the Evil Heavenly Emperor?
 Before leaving the Immortal World, the Heavenly Emperor had been plotted against by Jade Emperor Zhou Yan. The inferior Strange Deity had possessed his body. At that time, Han Jue had not completely purified it and was helpless.
 Han Jue pulled out his interpersonal relationships and checked the Heavenly Emperor’s portrait.
 The Heavenly Emperor’s name had already become the Evil Heavenly Emperor. His face looked very sinister. He had white hair and sharp eyebrows. His eyes had turned into dual pupils, and there was a vertical pattern between his eyebrows that looked like a closed eye.
 Most importantly, the Evil Heavenly Emperor’s cultivation had already reached the late-stage Pseudo-Sage!
 This cultivation speed was so fast! Han Jue hesitated for a moment and decided to visit the Heavenly Emperor in his dreams.
 The Heavenly Emperor couldn’t resist the Dark Nightmare at all.
 The dream was a small forest near the Jade Pure Sacred Sect more than forty thousand years ago. It was also a place of remembrance for Han Jue and the Heavenly Emperor.
 He saw that things had changed as he saw the Heavenly Emperor again.
 The Heavenly Emperor wore a dragon-patterned black robe and a dragon horn with a jade-purple golden crown. Three fan-shaped sword shadows floated behind him.
 Seeing Han Jue, the Heavenly Emperor was stunned.
 The two of them stared at each other silently.
 Several breaths later.
 The Heavenly Emperor sighed. “You’re stronger than I expected. You’ve already attained the Dao?”
 Han Jue said, “I’m not a Heavenly Dao Sage yet. How have you been, Your Majesty?”
 The Heavenly Emperor smiled. “Not bad. I’ve never felt so free. Han Jue, if you can’t stay in the Immortal World, you can come to the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End to seek refuge with me. I’ve established a new Heavenly Court.”
 “How is the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End compared to the Immortal World?”
 “It’s even more dangerous and desolate, but it’s also filled with opportunities.”
 Han Jue was stunned.
 Desolate?
 He had always thought that the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End was more prosperous than the Immortal World and was equivalent to a high-level Immortal World. But from the Heavenly Emperor’s words, that was not the case.
 The Heavenly Emperor sighed. “The Deity Realm of the Ruins of End was born before the Immortal World. It was the number one world of the Heavenly Dao. It was once shattered by the battle of the Sages. In order to prevent such a situation from happening again, the Dao Ancestor pieced together the fragments of the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End into the Immortal World. The Deity Realm of the Ruins of End itself is filled with karma, grudges, and negative karma. It has long been abandoned. Now, it is regarded as the path to the Ancient Desolate. There are too many mighty figures fighting and dying on this path. The opportunities left behind are immeasurable.”
 Han Jue couldn’t help but think of the Sage War in the Investiture of the Gods. Could it be that the birth of the Immortal World was related to this?
 He asked, “Where’s the Ancient Desolate?”
 The Heavenly Emperor shook his head. “Ancient Desolate, that is a mysterious place. Even if someone comes out alive, they won’t tell the truth. I’m not sure, either.”
 Han Jue was deep in thought.
 The Heavenly Emperor stared at him with a burning gaze. “Han Jue, come. Join me and I will confer you the title of Heavenly Emperor. In the Heavenly Court, you will be second only to one person and above ten thousand. We will join forces and conquer the Dark Forbidden Zone. We will sweep through the Great Worlds and create an unprecedented great undertaking!”
 Han Jue remained silent.
 For some reason, he felt that the Heavenly Emperor had changed.
 Apart from ambition, he also became more invasive.
 “What about the Immortal World? What plan do you have for the Immortal World now?” Han Jue asked.
 The Heavenly Emperor said proudly, “I’ll return sooner or later. All the Sages will pay the price! I’ll sweep through the Immortal World. Anyone who doesn’t obey will be destroyed!”
 Han Jue said, “I’ll consider it.”
 “Mm.”
 The two of them continued to chat for a while.
 After the dream ended, Han Jue opened his eyes and frowned.
 The Heavenly Emperor had really turned dark!
 Apart from strength, he was a standard villain now!
 Of course, from the Heavenly Emperor’s point of view, his change was understandable.
 “The Heavenly Emperor can even make a name for himself in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End. Perhaps it’s not as terrifying as I imagined, but there must be someone stronger than me.”
 Han Jue thought silently and continued cultivating
 Five hundred years later. The Heavenly Dao changed.
 “I am Heavenly Venerate Wufa, the new Sage of the Heavenly Dao. I control the order of slaughter in the Heavenly Dao and created the Wufa Sect!”
 A domineering voice resounded throughout the Heavenly Dao.
