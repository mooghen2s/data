 He had to use the derivation function to ask.
 “Why do I feel uneasy?”
 (3 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?)
 This was already the value of a Heavenly Dao Sage!
 Han Jue frowned and chose to continue.
 A figure appeared in his mind, and lines of words appeared in front of him.
 (Three Pure Sacred Ancestor: Perfected Pseudo-Sage Realm, Immeasurable Emperor, fused with the Dharma Idol of a Sage. Disciple of the Dao Ancestor. The strongest in the Immortal World. Because you accepted Li Daokong and Li Xuan’ao, the other Sages mocked and ridiculed Li Muyi, who became furious and released the Three Pure Sacred Ancestor. He is prepared to preach the Dao to the Immortal World and suppress the Hidden Sect and the various providence sects.]
 The Three Pure Sacred Ancestor had white hair and looked sage-like. There was nothing special about his appearance. He was fused with a Sage’s Dharma Idol. Could it be that Laozi, the Heavenly Sect Master, and the Heavenly Lord of Primordial Beginning had created him together?
 If that was the case, he was indeed very strong.
 The strongest in the Immortal World had already become a title of providence!
 Han Jue frowned and secretly asked, “Can I defeat the Three Pure Sacred Ancestor?”
 (3 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 (You can’t kill the Three Pure Sacred Ancestor in the Heavenly Dao. You can kill him outside the Heavenly Dao.]
 Han Jue raised his eyebrows. So fierce?
 The Three Pure Sacred Ancestor treated the entire Immortal World as his Dao Field. He was invincible.
 However, Han Jue wasn’t afraid. The Three Pure Sacred Ancestor wasn’t a Sage and couldn’t break through his Dao Field.
 Moreover, from the outcome of the previous derivation, the appearance of the Three Pure Sacred Ancestor wasn’t targeted at him, but at the entire force of the Immortal World.
 “It has been less than twenty thousand years since the calamity ended. I hope that you won’t cause trouble and focus on farming.”
 Han Jue thought silently.
 Under normal circumstances, billions of years would have to pass before the next Immeasurable Calamity. He was afraid that the Sages were interfering.
 However, even if a Sage took action, the prerequisite for triggering the calamity was that there were enough living beings in the Immortal World.
 Without enough pawns, how could they play chess?
 The Heavenly Dao couldn’t sense a burden, so it naturally did not release endless negative karma.
 Han Jue stood up and walked out of the Daoist temple. He was disturbed by the Three Pure Sacred Ancestor, so he went out to take a walk.
 The disciples had already walked out of their residences and were discussing the heavenly phenomenon.
 Han Jue came to the Fusang Tree, and the disciples immediately surrounded him.
 “Master, what’s with this phenomenon?” The Black Hell Chicken was the first to ask.
 Han Jue smiled. “Perhaps a mighty figure has appeared. Perhaps the Human School wants to deal with us. If you go out, you will definitely die.”
 The Black Hell Chicken hurriedly nodded. “I’m not going out. Whoever goes out is a fool.”
 Tu Ling’er came over and asked, “Master, when are you asking me to go to your Daoist temple?”
 What was she saying!
 Han Jue knew what she meant and said calmly, “Let’s wait until you have a breakthrough.”
 He flashed to the Fusang Tree and asked, “How’s the situation recently?”
 The Fusang Tree replied, “I formed two more space-time vortexes, but without your permission, I didn’t activate them.”
 Han Jue smiled. “Not bad. You’ve learned to be obedient. Let me take a look.”
 With that, two space-time vortexes appeared in front of him.
 Han Jue scanned with his divine sense and quickly saw the entire situation of the two worlds.
 Compared to the Chiliocosm World, these two worlds were much weaker. The strongest was only at the Zenith Heaven Realm.
 “They seem to have formed a Heavenly Dao of their own.”
 Han Jue frowned.
 The karma between the Heavenly Dao of the two worlds and the Heavenly Dao of the Immortal World was very weak. As a Pseudo-Sage, Han Jue could deduce it even without the derivation function.
 Han Jue was very curious. Other than the Immortal World and the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End, how many Heavenly Dao Worlds were hidden?
 Could it be related to the number of Sages?
 Han Jue felt that the strongest should be the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End. However, the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End and the Immortal World were separated by the Dark Forbidden Zone. They didn’t interfere with each other.
 Regarding the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End, Han Jue’s intention was to never step into it unless he could dominate it.
 After watching for a while, Han Jue lost interest.
 He asked the Fusang Tree to close the spatial vortex. Just as he was about to ask about its cultivation situation, the Black Hell Chicken’s scream sounded beside him. “Oh my god! The sky is splitting!”
 The Black Hell Chicken’s voice was very sharp.
 Han Jue looked up and saw a huge black crack in the purple sky that stretched to the horizon.
 Han Jue vaguely saw a pair of eyes spying on the Immortal World.
 In front of these eyes, everything seemed tiny.
 It hid in the darkness with a cold gaze.
 Han Jue used the simulation trial to detect the surrounding enemies and didn’t detect them. This meant that the other party was extremely far from the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 Three Pure Sacred Ancestor?
 No!
 Han Jue felt killing intent. The other party was filled with killing intent towards the Immortal World!
 Soon, the crack in the sky shrank and the purple light disappeared.
 Han Jue returned to the Daoist temple. The Dao Field wouldn’t be affected even if the sky collapsed. He wasn’t worried at all.
 “I seem to be a little arrogant now?” Han Jue thought silently. Ever since the Dao Field upgraded, he was not as cautious as before.
 He would become a Sage first. Otherwise, he would be an ant in the end!
 Even if he couldn’t be killed, he would still be an ant.
 Inside a palace.
 Li Muyi, the South Extreme Heavenly Venerate, and Sect Master Tian Jue meditated around him.
RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only Sect Master Tian Jue snorted. “What does Shi Dudao mean?”
 The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate said with an ugly expression, “I don’t know when he formed a grudge with the Three Pure Sacred Ancestor.”
 Li Muyi said, “Although Shi Dudao is strong, it’s impossible for him to kill the Three Pure Sacred Ancestor in the Immortal World. We don’t have to worry.”
 Sect Master Tian Jue looked at Li Muyi and snorted. “Why did you let the Three Pure Sacred Ancestor out?”
 The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate also looked at him with an unfriendly gaze.
 Li Mu said expressionlessly, “The Hidden Sect is too strong. If we let them be, all the geniuses of the Immortal World will be absorbed by them. The Dao Sect needs a true mighty figure to preach the Dao.”
 Sect Master Tian Jue and the South Extreme Heavenly Venerate still frowned, not believing his words.
 ar
 Li Muyi said, “Shi Dudao is always wandering around the Sage Dao Field. He once almost became the personal disciple of the Dao Ancestor. If he and the Three Pure Sacred Ancestor fight, it will be a huge loss for the Dao Sect no matter who wins. We’re the disciples of the Dao Sect, we have to stop it.”
 Sect Master Tian Jue narrowed his eyes and said, “The Three Pure Sacred Ancestor is the obstacle between our Dao Sect and the Dao Destruction Mystical Power. The Dao Ancestor taught Qiu Xilai and Sage Fated Secrets the Dao Destruction Mystical Power. He also created the Three Pure Sacred Ancestor for us, and he has the ability to slaughter all living beings. He hopes that we can coexist peacefully. However, Sage Fated Secrets has already gone mad. Don’t you think it’s strange that you released the Three Pure Sacred Ancestor?”
 The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate’s eyes flickered. It was unknown what he was thinking
 Clearly, there was a conflict between the three Sages, and they could not trust each other.
 Li Muyi said slowly, “Ever since the previous Heavenly Dao Sage retired, the Three Pure Sacred Ancestor has always belonged to me. I have the right to control him. As for your doubts, in my opinion, there’s no Dark Forbidden Lord at all.”
 Sect Master Tian Jue stood up and said, “In that case, feel free.”
 He vanished.
 The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate also stood up. He said, “By the way, although the Three Pure Sacred Ancestor is strong, can he withstand the Dao Destruction Mystical Power?”
 With that, he turned into a black shadow and dispersed like mist.
