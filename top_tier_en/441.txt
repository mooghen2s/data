 Ancestor Xitian was too strong. Han Jue couldn’t gain any experience from fighting him. He needed to challenge an ordinary Sage.
 Soon, Hidden Sect Island stopped trembling as it left the Sages’ battlefield.
 At first, Han Jue was worried that the Sages had come for him. Now, it seemed that that was not the case.
 “Why is Fuxitian fighting with the South Extreme Heavenly Venerate?” Han Jue asked in his mind. He was afraid that these two Sages were acting.
 (4 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?] Continue!
 [To fight for providence, they both contain killing intent.]
 Han Jue raised his eyebrows. In other words, these two Sages were not acting. They were really fighting
 He heaved a sigh of relief.
 As long as it was not a plot against him.
 Hidden Sect Island continued to fly for several months before Han Jue stopped it.
 This time, he was far away from the two Sages.
 “I want to know if Hidden Sect Island was discovered by other living beings other than the people on the island?” Han Jue asked in his mind.
 [A billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [Not for the time being.)
 Han Jue completely relaxed and smiled. The Strange Deity came over and started to rub against him.
 Han Jue instructed it to massage him.
T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by nov(ê(l)biin.co/m After a long time, the Strange Deity had already gotten used to this. It even felt that this was something it should do.
 Han Jue closed his eyes and muttered to himself, “Oh you, when will you grow up?”
 The Strange Deity didn’t reply. Its intelligence hadn’t increased for a long time. It could understand some of Han Jue’s intentions, but it couldn’t communicate.
 That was good.
 This was to prevent it from thinking of escaping Han Jue when it was really mature and had its own thoughts.
 For the next period of time, Han Jue checked his surroundings from time to time, afraid that the Sages would come again. In the blink of an eye, another fifty years passed.
 The Sages no longer appeared around the Dao Field.
 It had been five hundred years since Han Jue broke through.
 However, he was still a distance away from the late-stage Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm.
 As expected of the Zenith Heaven Realm. It seemed that cultivating it fully in two thousand years was completely wishful thinking.
 Not long ago, the Hidden Sect’s Hundred Year Competition had just ended. Because Zhao Xuanyuan was the only Deity Realm existence, Han Jue arranged for him to fight with Lü Bu and Ma Chao.
 In the end…
 Zhao Xuanyuan became depressed.
 He actually couldn’t defeat the guards. These two were Han Jue’s subordinates.
 Therefore, Zhao Xuanyuan cultivated madly and simulated the trial.
 He didn’t mention what had happened to him, but the others were stimulated. Even the geniuses of the Deity Realm were so hardworking. How could they relax?
 For a time, the fighting atmosphere in Hidden Sect Island became more and more intense.
 Inside the Connate Cave Abode.
 Han Jue was reading the emails.
 The Sages appeared more and more frequently. Even his good friend Qiu Xilai was attacked by them.
 Chaos. The entire world was in chaos.
 At that moment, he suddenly sensed the Chaotic Domain’s summoning.
 It was probably Dao Sovereign again. Han Jue had nothing to do, so he headed to the Chaotic Domain.
 After entering the Chaotic Domain, Han Jue met Dao Sovereign and Zhou Fan.
 Dao Sovereign said directly, “Brother, save us!”
 Han Jue asked, “Location, enemy.”
 “Nine Heavens Hanging Mountain, the Sage of the Buddhist Sect, Qiu Xilai.” “Just wait for your death.” “No, brother!”
 “Then tell me, who should I look for?”
 “Find Fuxitian!”
 “How?”
 Han Jue was speechless. He felt that Dao Sovereign was nuts.
 Zhou Fan said, “You can ask Heavenly Emperor Fang to find Fuxitian. Now, the humans and the Heavenly Court are trembling under the pressure of a Sage. There’s a possibility that they will face a common enemy.”
 Han Jue asked in surprise, “How can the humans and Heavenly Court be united against a common enemy? Even if they join forces, they are only cannon fodder in front of the Sages.”
 Zhou Fan said, “There are rumors that a certain Sage is preparing to destroy all living beings in the world. At that time, all living beings below the Sage will die. The Human Race and the Heavenly Court will be in turmoil and will naturally ally.”
 Han Jue was stunned.
 Why did this sound so much like the Dao Destruction Mystical Power?
 Could it be that Sages also possessed the Dao Destruction Mystical Power? Han Jue immediately asked in his mind, “Who among the Heavenly Dao Sages has a Dao Destruction Mystical Power?”
 (4 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [Among the Heavenly Dao Sages, two have grasped the Dao Destruction Mystical Power. They are Qiu Xilai and Sage Fated Secrets.]
 Indeed!
 Han Jue suddenly felt a sense of danger.
 If a Sage used the Dao Destruction Mystical Power, wouldn’t he also die?
 F*ck!
 Back when he had comprehended Life of All, why didn’t he think of this?
 The more Han Jue thought about it, the more uneasy he became.
 Zhou Fan asked, “Senior, do you agree to help?”
 Han Jue asked back, “What can I get?”
 Dao Sovereign replied, “After this matter is over, I will join you. Like Zhao Xuanyuan, I will serve you from now on.”
 “Fine.”
 Han Jue left after saying that.
 He felt uneasy after returning to the Connate Cave Abode.
 Damn it!
 The effect of this Dao Destruction Mystical Power was indeed different when it appeared in the hands of others. Han Jue thought that it was useless before, but now that he thought about it, it was simply too terrifying.
 “However, Sages shouldn’t dare to use it rashly. Who wants to lose a major realm?”
 Han Jue thought silently. If they used it to clean up all living beings, they would definitely offend other Sages. After all, the teachings of the Sages were all in the Immortal World.
 At that time, the user would lose a major realm. It was no different from waiting for death.
 Han Jue asked in his mind, “If the Sage uses the Dao Destruction Mystical Power, will I die?”
 (A billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [Not for the time being. The Dao Field is far from the calamity and the Heavenly Dao. None of the living beings in the Dao Field will die.]
 Han Jue widened his eyes and heaved a sigh of relief.
 That’s good!
 He was almost frightened to death.
 “In that case, either Qiu Xilai or Sage Fated Secrets must be wanting to cause trouble.” Han Jue frowned and thought.
 When he thought of the Heavenly Emperor, Su Qi, Xuan Qingjun, Fang Liang, Zhou Fan, and the others, Han Jue hesitated again. Should he do something?
 Forget it.
 He decided to wait and see.
 He couldn’t provoke a Sage unless it was absolutely necessary.
 Han Jue asked in his mind, “I want to know if Qiu Xilai and Sage Fated Secrets want to use the Dao Destruction Mystical Power?”
 (2 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [Neither Sage has a motive for the time being.)
 Han Jue smiled again.
 He had a bold thought. Could it be that his epiphany of the Dao Destruction Mystical Power had been sensed by the Sages?
 It was really possible!
 How could the Sages not suspect each other when an unknown existence comprehended a Dao Destruction Mystical Power?
 “This is also good. The Dao Destruction Mystical Power is a killing machine. In the future, if anyone wants to deal with me and is forced into a corner, I will use Life of All to threaten them. As long as they don’t want to destroy their own lineage, they will definitely not dare to provoke me.”
 Han Jue thought silently. Although he wanted to, it was best not to expose this Mystical Power. It would attract too much hatred.
 Han Jue took out the Heavenly Dao Token and contacted Fang Liang.
 Soon, the divine sense connection was successful.
 Han Jue asked, “I have something to ask of?you.”
 Fang Liang did not answer. Han Jue sensed that something was wrong and asked, “Are you still there?”
 A deep voice sounded, “Yes.”
 Damn it!
 Han Jue directly severed his divine sense connection. This voice was definitely not Fang Liang’s!
