 After returning to the Hundred Peak Immortal River, Han Jue sat on the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus.
 He discussed with Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du for two hours and finally decided to wait for the Reincarnation Space to develop for a period of time before forcing the Chaotic Fiendcelestial to appear. Han Jue didn’t deduce where the Chaotic Fiendcelestial was. Unlike Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du, he was only interested in this matter and didn’t have to do anything. Therefore, he was not as anxious as the other party. The matter of killing the Dark Sage King attracted the hatred of 26 mighty figures. For the next period of time, he had to keep a low profile.
 He decided to keep a low profile for thousands of years before cursing these guys.
 Han Jue opened the emails and looked at the changes in his circle of friends recently.

 Evil Heavenly Emperor...
 Seeing his situation, Han Jue sighed silently.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor had a path to take. Little did he know that the backing of the Dark Sage King was the backing of the Heavenly Dao Sages.
 After so many twists and turns, the Evil Heavenly Emperor was still a pawn and couldn’t break through the cages of those mighty figures.
 Looking down, Han Jue saw what happened to Fuxitian and had a bad feeling.
 With Fuxitian dead, a more overbearing Sage would definitely descend next. Just like the previous Heavenly Venerate Wufa, there would be internal strife among the Sages again. When the next Heavenly Dao calamity arrived, the Sages would fight among themselves, and it would be very difficult for them to unite.
 Han Jue had already deduced the plans of the mighty figures in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End, but he couldn’t say it.
 His only advantage was that those mighty figures didn’t know that he already knew the truth.
 Han Jue wanted to use this to break them up.
 It was impossible for these mighty figures to be absolutely united!
 After reading the emails, Han Jue continued cultivating.
 He was waiting for the opportunity to curse.
 It had been a long time since he had lasted cursed. He missed it.
 It was time for the Dark Forbidden Lord to appear again!
 Netherworld, by the Yellow Spring.
 Yang Tiandong was meditating when Empress Houtu appeared above the Yellow Spring.
 Sensing her aura, Yang Tiandong hurriedly opened his eyes and bowed.
 Empress Houtu asked, “I’ve already investigated. I still don’t know who attacked you. Recently, the defense of the netherworld has been strengthened. The Sages left the Immortal World not long ago to deal with the Dark Sage King. Sage Fuxitian has sacrificed himself. The crisis of the Heavenly Dao might only begin now. The netherworld is the lowest level of the Heavenly Dao. It might become a breakthrough point for the unknown enemy.”
 Yang Tiandong frowned. “Empress, my cultivation level is very weak. I’m afraid it’s difficult for me to protect the netherworld...”
 “Don’t worry. I will let the eighteen kings of hell return. They are all Zenith Heaven Golden Immortals. This is also the greatest power that the netherworld has accumulated.”
 Eighteen Zenith Heaven Golden Immortals!
 Yang Tiandong’s eyelids twitched. So powerful?
 He heaved a sigh of relief, but he was also a little worried.
 The return of the eighteen ancient kings would definitely affect his status.
 Would he be killed?
 Empress Houtu continued, “I will leave the Immortal World for a period of time next. Discuss everything with the Great King of Hell. He has a wide network and can deal with all situations.”
 “Understood.”
 Empress Houtu vanished, and Yang Tiandong stood up to leave.
 On the way back, Yang Tiandong was worried. He felt that something big was about to happen.
 On the other side.
 The Immortal World was still circulating on its own. The battle of the Sages had not spread. The living beings saved by the Sages were still imprisoned in the Sage Dao Field. It was only because they had the power of darkness that they had to be completely eliminated to make the Sages feel at ease.
 In the past tens of thousands of years, the most famous mighty figure in the Immortal World was Great Loose Heaven.
 He held the top position in the Heavenly Dao Providence Board and controlled the first mortal world. The Loose Heaven Sect he created was spread throughout the Immortal World and its power increased day by day.
 Ever since the Buzhou Divine Mountain had become a dangerous place, Li Daokong’s reputation had also plummeted. It was unknown who had secretly spread the news that he was once the eldest disciple of the Human School. For a time, the label of bloodthirsty and traitors fell on Li Daokong. He didn’t defend himself and did as he pleased.
 vas  Li Daokong’s development was not good, but the Holy Mother Sect supported by the Hidden Sect developed very smoothly. They recruited countless female disciples. In addition, Huang Zuntian often took care of them. The alliance of the two schools was extremely helpful to each other.
 The Heavenly Race also sent immortals to visit the Holy Mother Sect from time to time. The Holy Mother Sect had already become a major force.
 After tens of thousands of years, all the living beings in the world had already forgotten about the Hidden Sect, but their power on the surface was already very terrifying.
 On this day.
 The Buzhou Divine Mountain welcomed a human cultivator. He wore a green robe and looked imposing. His face was not too outstanding. He had a Grand Unity Earth Immortal cultivation and was not considered powerful.
 After entering the mountain, he rushed to the
 top.
 When he was halfway up the mountain, a bolt of lightning suddenly descended, almost killing him.
 “Go back.”
 Li Daokong’s voice sounded extremely indifferent.
 The green-robed man gritted his teeth and said, “I’m a human cultivator, Meng Xiao. I didn’t mean to disturb you, Senior. I want to ascend the highest peak in the Immortal World and complain that the Immortal Gods are unfair!”
 His eyes were determined without any fear.
 “Then go to the 13th Heaven. Don’t disturb Buzhou’s peace.”
 Li Daokong’s voice sounded again with a hint of impatient.
 Meng Xiao knelt down and cupped his fists. “The humans are not allowed to go to the 13th Heaven. I can’t meet the Heavenly Ancestor, so I can only come to the Buzhou Divine Mountain. Legend has it that if I can stand at the top of the Buzhou Divine Mountain, I shout out at the 33rd Heaven. This is the only way!
 “I hope that Senior can allow it. Otherwise, I can only die under you. I have nothing to worry about in this life!”
 Boom
 A bolt of lightning struck, instantly charring Meng Xiao black and causing him to roll down the hill.
 However, he quickly stabilized himself and stood up trembling. He continued to climb up.
 Blood began to seep out of his charred body. Meng Xiao looked like a ghost, but his eyes were still bright and determined.
 “Senior... please... allow...”
 As Meng Xiao ascended the mountain, he spoke with a trembling voice. His voice was weak and not as loud as the wind.
 The Buzhou Divine Mountain fell into silence.
 Tacitly agreeing, Li Daokong no longer stopped him.
 Several months later, the severely injured Meng Xiao finally arrived at the top of the Buzhou Divine Mountain with much difficulty.
 The top of the mountain pierced through the sea of clouds. Meng Xiao knelt at the top of the mountain and gasped for breath. The sunlight shone on him, and his injuries had already recovered. He used a spell to clean his body and changed into a clean robe, but he was in a bad state. His face was pale and his body swayed. Meng Xiao looked up and slowly raised his right hand.
 He had never felt the heavens being so close to him.
 He gritted his teeth and raised his head to shout, “I, Meng Xiao of the Human Race, denounce the Heavenly God General of the Heavenly Race. He slaughtered the men and humiliated the women of my race. The Immortal Gods are unfair. Heavenly Ancestor, please uphold justice for us!”
