 Seeing this, Dan Long frowned and began to quickly brandish his sword. Great Dharmic powers poured out from his body like a flood breaking through a dam, shaking the ground. The humans also heard the commotion. Cultivators flew out of the city and watched from afar.
 They recognized Dan Long as the mighty figure who had preached the Dao to them.
 “What is that Immortal doing?”
 “Something seems to be stopping him.”
 “He wants to challenge the Immortal Land?”
 “What should we do? Ancestor Zhou Fan once said that we are not allowed to enter the immortal land. Could this mighty figure be Ancestor Zhou Fan’s enemy?”
 “We have no choice. Just stay out of it.”
 No matter how Dan Long attacked or even affected the human cities, he couldn’t break through the Dao Field.
 The originally nervous Hidden Sect members were all amused. The Connate lifeforms also began to tease him.
 Li Daokong sighed. “I didn’t expect Sect Master to have such an array formation. I can’t sense what it is at all.”
 Li Xuan’ao nodded and smiled teasingly. “Look at Dan Long. He’s flustered and exasperated. This is the first time I’ve seen him like this. It’s really embarrassing.
 “After saying so much, you can’t barge in. Perhaps the other Sages are watching.”
 Ten minutes later, Dan Long gave up.
 He floated in the air with an extremely dark expression.
 He was in a dilemma. He could neither advance nor retreat.
 Leaving just like that would not only embarrass him but also the Human School.
 But it wouldn’t work if he continued trying to barge in.
 Han Jue’s voice floated out, “Senior, there’s really no one from the Human School in the Hidden Sect. Please understand and leave.”
 He spoke very politely, wanting to give Dan Long a way out.
 But it was useless to give him an out now!
 Dan Long could imagine the Sages all watching him from beyond the 33rd Heaven. If he left today, he would really lose all his face.
 But what could he do now?
 Dan Long glanced at the distant human city.
 The Human Race was so close to the Hundred Peak Immortal River. Could they be related?
 Dan Long’s eyes flickered.
 “If you want to threaten me with the Human Race, is the Human School’s ideals still kept?” Han Jue’s voice sounded again.
 Only Dan Long could hear this voice.
 His expression turned even uglier.
 “Stop before it’s too late. Don’t fall into eternal damnation.”
 Han Jue’s voice entered Dan Long’s ears again.
 He wasn’t afraid of him. He just didn’t want to fall out with the entire Human School now.
 When Dan Long heard this, he was completely moved. He turned around and left.
 Although he was very unhappy with Han Jue, he was telling the truth.
 After Dan Long left, peace returned to the world.
 Apart from Li Daokong and Li Xuan’ao, the ones affected the most were the humans.
 After experiencing Dan Long’s lecture, the humans all thought that he was very strong, but they didn’t expect that he couldn’t even enter the immortal land!
 What kind of mighty figure was hidden in the immortal land?
 In the future, the Hundred Peak Immortal River would become a legend of the Human Race.
 Li Daokong and Li Xuan’ao were completely relaxed. They were no longer worried about being hunted down by the Human School and could cultivate in peace.
 Ten years later.
 Han Jue received Qiu Xilai’s dream.
 This fellow was spamming again!
 Han Jue chose to accept it. He wanted to see what Qiu Xilai had to say.
 In the dream.
 The moment Han Jue appeared, he heard Qiu Xilai ask, “You took in Li Daokong and Li Xuan’ao?”
 Han Jue was already prepared. “When I took them in, they were no longer part of the Human School.”
 Qiu Xilai said, “You offended Li Muyi. It won’t be easy for you later. Send these two to our Buddhist Sect.”
 Qiu Xilai had been coveting Li Daokong for a long time.
 Among the Dao Sect disciples, Li Daokong was the most talented.
 Li Daokong didn’t have a Chaotic Physique. His talent was mainly displayed in his comprehension ability.
 Not to mention the previous calamity, even if a few more were compared, Li Daokong’s potential was unparalleled!
 Han Jue said, “Then, I have to ask for their intention.”
 “Give them to the Buddhist Sect directly.”
 “I’m afraid not.”
 Han Jue shook his head.
 The atmosphere instantly fell silent.
 Han Jue wasn’t afraid of breaking up with him. Otherwise, if this continued, Qiu Xilai would definitely ask for even more absurd things.
ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m “Han Jue, do you still remember my kindness?” Qiu Xilai asked again, his tone becoming unprecedentedly cold.
 Han Jue said, “I remember. I owe you a favor, and I will definitely repay you in the future. However, I only want to cultivate now and not participate in the battle. Li Daokong has done me a favor, so I have to accept him. Of course, if the Buddhist Sect is in trouble in the future, I won’t stand by and watch.”
 He was bullshitting. Li Daokong had little karma with him.
 Qiu Xilai naturally understood this, but he didn’t want to push Han Jue away directly. After all, the other Sages were watching.
 Even if Han Jue offended the Human School and Qiu Xilai, he could still seek refuge with Chan the School, the Jie School, and even other Heavenly Dao Sages.
 The current Han Jue wasn’t just a variable. The Hidden Sect had already displayed its potential!
 Qiu Xilai said, “Just remember what you said. I will help you persuade the Human School. I just hope that there won’t be a next time.”
 “Thank you, Sage!” Han Jue immediately replied.
 (Qiu Xilai has developed hatred towards you. Current Hatred Points: 1.5 stars]
 Han Jue ignored him. To Sages, being able to develop disgust was already considered an enemy.
 However, Qiu Xilai felt that Han Jue was still useful and didn’t want to break up for the time being
 The dream ended.
 Han Jue returned to the Daoist temple and continued cultivating.
 In any case, Sages couldn’t enter the Immortal World or break through his Dao Field. He didn’t care at all.
 However, Qiu Xilai’s attitude proved Li Daokong’s talent.
 He could become a Sage!
 Han Jue’s heart beat faster.
 Apart from him, Li Daokong was definitely the closest one to becoming a Sage in the entire Hidden Sect.
 What Han Jue wanted to do was to nurture other disciples while cultivating. This way, he could continue cultivating and have his disciples help him resolve any problems.
 After Dan Long left, the Human School no longer sent any mighty figures to find trouble. They seemed to have given up.
 The Hidden Sect Competition began again. This time, Li Daokong and Li Xuan’ao joined.
 As expected, Li Daokong took first place. Li Xuan’ao and Dao Sovereign tied, taking second place. Zhao Xuanyuan was third, Zhou Fan was fourth, and Li Yao was fifth. There weren’t many changes in the rankings after that.
 However, this matter agitated the other disciples.
 Would other experts join the Hidden Sect in the future?
 At the same age, they were confident, but compared to those mighty figures who had lived for countless years, they were definitely far inferior.
 For a time, the Hidden Sect stirred up another wind of cultivation.
 Li Daokong wasn’t proud. He challenged Han Jue again and was ruthlessly insta-killed. His Dao heart almost shattered.
 After fighting Han Jue, he even suspected that he was not a Pseudo-Sage.
 The difference in talent was too great!
 Just like that, eight hundred years passed.
 On this day.
 The sky was suddenly filled with purple light. It was endless and beautiful.
 Han Jue, who was cultivating, opened his eyes and looked up. His gaze passed through the Daoist temple to the sky.
 A strong sense of uneasiness arose in his heart.
 It had been a long time since he felt so uneasy!
