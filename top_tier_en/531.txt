 They could still feel the terrifying pressure even through the Dao Field array formation.
 “The First Guardian is so powerful!”
 “Who has the upper hand?”
 “They’re too fast. I can’t see clearly!”
 “What realm are they at? Zenith Heaven?”
 “I’m afraid that’s not all. Previously, when Sect Master was preaching, didn’t he say that there are still realms between Zenith Heaven and Sage!”
 “Shi Dudao is very strong. The First Guardian actually can’t take him down quickly. Sect Master is still the strongest. The enemy was defeated in one strike!”
 “Don’t speak nonsense. The First Guardian is also very strong. Isn’t this Shi Dudao a mighty figure who created the Invincible Dao many years ago? To dare call himself invincible, he must be very strong.”
 The disciples discussed among themselves. Because Han Jue had been the one to attack in the Dao Field, the enemy couldn’t last more than a breath of time. Now, seeing Li Daokong and Shi Dudao in a stalemate, the disciples were somewhat disappointed.
 After all, they didn’t know how strong Shi Dudao was.
 The personal disciples under the Fusang Tree were very considerate.
 “Shi Dudao looks exactly like the three seniors of our Dao Field. Senior Zhang Jue has the cultivation of a Sage that Master copied. Those three seniors are the replicated Shi Dudao?” The Black Hell Chicken clicked its tongue in wonder. Ah Da said angrily, “Do I need your explanation?”
 The Chaotic Heavenly Dog sighed. “It’s really strong. If not for the Dao Field array formation, we would probably have been reduced to ashes by the battle’s aftermath.”
 The others also sighed. Although there was a simulation trial, they couldn’t force Li Daokong’s true strength out. Therefore, they were shocked to see his and Shi Dudao’s battle.
 On the other side.
 Inside the Daoist temple.
 Han Jue frowned and looked dissatisfied.
 He was filled with anticipation for Li Daokong, but it was a little difficult for him to defeat Shi Dudao.
 Although Li Daokong was at the early-stage Pseudo-Sage Realm and Shi Dudao was a perfected Pseudo-Sage, he still had expectations for him.
 “If you can’t defeat the enemy who is higher by minor realms, how can you be the face of my Hidden Sect?”
 Han Jue was dissatisfied. After this battle ended, he had to pressure Li Daokong.
 Perhaps his protection was too strong, causing him to relax.
 The battle continued.
 After an hour, no clear winner could be seen between the two. However, Han Jue saw it clearly. Li Daokong was completely suppressed.
 He sighed and raised his right hand. He extended his index finger and a sword aura shot out.
 Shi Dudao, who was about to use his Mystical Power, was caught off guard. His body was pierced by the sword Qi from the side and blood splattered into the sky.
 The spell was interrupted.
 Shi Dudao widened his eyes in shock. Li Daokong immediately stopped and did not take the opportunity to attack.
T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by nov(ê(l)biin.co/m His face was ashen. He knew that Han Jue had intervened. That sword Qi just now made his heart palpitate.
 Too fast!
 “Let’s end this here.”
 Han Jue’s voice resounded through the world.
 Shi Dudao looked at the Hundred Peak Immortal River in fear and gritted his teeth. “Sage!”
 A sword Qi dispersed the vast Dharmic powers in his body. If it was not a Sage, what was?
 In the past, Shi Dudao had also overestimated himself and challenged a Sage. This feeling of fear was difficult to forget.
 Li Daokong suddenly vanished.
 Shi Dudao gritted his teeth and struggled for a while before finally choosing to leave.
 It couldn’t be helped. The difference in strength was too great. If he stayed, he would only embarrass himself.
 The moment he turned around, Shi Dudao suddenly thought of Emperor Chen’s words.
 He was indeed not qualified to call himself invincible.
 Damn it…
 If I can become a Sage…
 Shi Dudao roared in his heart. He had already reached the limit of a Pseudo-Sage and could no longer become stronger. Below the Sages, he had indeed never lost.
 Inside the Daoist temple.
 Li Daokong stood in front of Han Jue with his head hanging like a child who had done something wrong.
 Han Jue said expressionlessly, “I’m very disappointed.”
 Li Daokong lowered his head even more and clenched his fists.
 Han Jue was suddenly amused.
 He was just worrying about not having a chance to suppress Li Daokong.
 Ever since he had joined the Hidden Sect, although Li Daokong respected him, he had never let go of his attitude. If ordinary people saw this, they would think that they were on the same level.
 On the contrary, Li Xuan’ao quickly accepted his status and made Han Jue like him.
 Han Jue said indifferently, “When I first entered the Pseudo-Sage Realm, I could sweep through all Pseudo-Sages, including Shi Dudao. Do you believe that?”
 Li Daokong took a deep breath and said, “Yes!”
 “How can you be a Sage of the Hidden Sect like this?”
 “I… am indeed not worthy…”
 Li Daokong wasn’t angry. Instead, he was upset and flustered.
 Han Jue began to mock and ridicule him. Li Daokong could only hold back.
 After a long time.
 Han Jue snorted. “Cultivate well. I’ll teach you a Mystical Power when you break through a minor realm. Then, you can challenge Shi Dudao again. You have to win. You’re the one I value the most. Don’t disappoint me!”
 “Understood!” Li Daokong replied in a low voice.
 Han Jue waved his hand, and Li Daokong bowed and left.
 When he walked out of the Daoist temple, Li Daokong glanced at Zhang Jue. The dissatisfaction in his heart immediately vanished.
 He was a proud person, after all. How could he not have emotions after being humiliated by Han Jue?
 However, when he saw Zhang Jue, there was only bitterness in his heart.
 Han Jue indeed had the right to mock him!
 On the way back, Li Xuan’ao came to fetch him and asked him what had happened.
 Li Daokong didn’t hide anything. With that, he sighed and left, preparing to cultivate diligently.
 Li Xuan’ao was stunned on the spot.
 “Shi Dudao? He’s almost the strongest existence below the Sages. Why are you making him sound like a mortal? One dares to say it and the other dares to believe it?” Li Xuan’ao muttered in confusion.
 The news that Shi Dudao had returned in failure from the Hundred Peak Immortal River quickly spread throughout the Immortal World.
 In the past few years, Shi Dudao had challenged everyone everywhere. Many providence sects had been provoked by him. This was the first time he had been defeated.
 There were many living beings near the Hundred Peak Immortal River. Occasionally, cultivators would pass by, and some coincidentally witnessed this battle. They were all shocked.
 For a time, legends of the Hundred Peak Immortal River rose again.
 The more mysterious it was, the easier it was to be imagined by living beings.
 Three hundred years later, the Hundred Peak Immortal River became a holy land passed down by word of mouth.
 13th Heaven.
 In a palace of the Heavenly Race, Ji Xianshen and Fang Liang met.
 “Tsk tsk, your Grandmaster’s Hidden Sect has been in the limelight again recently.” Ji Xianshen smiled.
 Fang Liang smiled indifferently. “It’s alright. Grandmaster definitely doesn’t want that.”
 Stop posturing!
 I’m your Uncle-Master now!
 Ji Xianshen was secretly pleased. He hadn’t told anyone that he had entered the Hidden Sect. Even Fang Liang didn’t know.
 The Hidden Sect was his final resort. He wouldn’t use it unless it was absolutely necessary.
 Although Fang Liang came from the Hidden Sect, he hadn’t returned for a long time. Perhaps they no longer treated him as sect a member.
 Ji Xianshen asked, “What’s the Heavenly Court’s decision?”
 Fang Liang said, “I have no objections. The current Heavenly Court is already desolate. The Sages have long stopped asking and only want to subdue the Dragon Race. Just me and you are probably not enough. The Dragon Race has a mighty figure who used the providence of the Immeasurable Calamity to become a Pseudo-Sage. He’s extremely powerful.”
