 Currently, Han Jue was busy attaining the Dao of Freedom Sage. Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du was also severely injured by a mysterious mighty figure and had no time to fight against the Earth Immortal World’s Chaotic Fiendcelestial.
 Han Jue asked Immortal Emperor Samsara to listen to the Sage of the Human School first. He was to pay more attention to the Reincarnators and see who had the best potential.
 He planned to choose the next Chaotic Fiendcelestial from the Earth Immortal World. Among the Heavenly Dao Sages, only Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du was paying attention to the Earth Immortal World. However, because it was far away, he wouldn’t pay too much attention.
 The number of Chaotic Fiendcelestials successors was limited. It was impossible for Han Jue to let all three thousand Chaotic Fiendcelestials be possessed by living beings. A portion of them had to be derived from themselves.
 After chatting for a few hours, Han Jue ended the dream and continued to fuse with the Great Dao of Extreme Origin.
 In another ten thousand years, he would definitely become a Freedom Sage!
 Immortal World, Reincarnation Mystic Realm.
 Han Tuo and Yi Tian were walking side by side. The two of them had relaxed expressions and were chatting and laughing.
 They were already Deity Realm experts now, and Yi Tian was extremely close to the Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm.
 “Can you really revive the dead? After so many years, your parents have probably reincarnated more than ten thousand times.” Yi Tian shook his head and said helplessly. His parents and wife had already become Han Tuo’s obsession. It even affected his cultivation, so Yi Tian came with him.
 A mysterious expert lived in the Reincarnation Mystic Realm. Back then, Han Tuo almost died here.
 A soul appeared above Han Tuo’s head. It was the Calamity’s Vengeful. Back then, he wanted to possess Han Jue, but he was subdued by him. Now, Han Tuo was the master. After tens of thousands of years, the two of them had already become friends of life and death. They were not master and servant.
 Calamity’s Vengeful had a solemn expression as he said, “Something’s wrong here. Be careful.”
 Yi Tian still respected Calamity’s Vengeful. After all, this was a Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal and had the memories of the countless ghosts of the previous calamity. He always introduced the history and broadened their horizons.
 Han Tuo said, “We’re no longer the same as before. Nothing should happen.”
 The three of them continued forward.
 According to his memories, Han Tuo came to the place he visited a long time ago and called the master of the Reincarnation Mystic Realm.
 Soon, the mystic realm master’s voice sounded. “It’s you again.”
T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by nov(ê(l)biin.co/m After tens of thousands of years, the other party still remembered him. Han Tuo frowned slightly.
 At that time, the master of the mystic realm had taught him a lesson.
 “Wait, something’s wrong with him!” Calamity’s Vengeful suddenly shouted with a horrified tone.
 Yi Tian asked in surprise, “What’s wrong?”
 “His aura isn’t that of a Heavenly Dao lifeform!” Calamity’s Vengeful said in a low voice, his voice trembling.
 The Master of the Mystic Realm chuckled. “Is it formed by resentment? Interesting. Since you’ve seen through my identity, don’t leave.” A black crack suddenly appeared and quickly expanded. A huge cold eye appeared and stared at Han Tuo and the other two. Yi Tian immediately took out a golden staff and prepared to fight.
 In the depths of the chaos, the Great Dao of Extreme Origin. Han Jue opened his eyes again. Five thousand years had passed.
 He was getting closer and closer to success.
 Han Jue suddenly discovered that another figure was staring at the Great Dao of Extreme Origin quietly.
 He hurriedly used the simulation trial.
 [Nüwa: Great Dao Sage, Immeasurable Emperor, Creator of the Human Race)
 Why was she here?
 Nüwa was wrapped in a strong light, so Han Jue didn’t recognize her.
 Even if they were good friends, Han Jue had no intention of going out to acknowledge her. He had always been vigilant against Nüwa. Han Jue entered the simulation trial and fought with her.
 In the end, he was killed by Nüwa.
 He only lasted five minutes.
 A Great Dao Sage was indeed powerful.
 Han Jue found it strange.
 Why could Nüwa jump from a Heavenly Dao Sage to a Great Dao Sage?
 She didn’t need to transcend the Freedom Sage?
 Could it be that Nüwa had long been a Freedom Sage, but she had reduced her cultivation level to a Heavenly Dao Sage halfway through like Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du and Heavenly Venerate Wufa?
 Han Jue was puzzled. He didn’t derive it. Anyway, he just treated Nüwa as a Great Dao Sage.
 After a long while…
 Just as Han Jue was about to continue his Dao Integration, another figure appeared. It was on the other side of the Great Dao of Extreme Origin and kept a distance from Nüwa.
 “I didn’t expect Nüwa to also have your eyes on this Great Dao. Are we fated?”
 A mocking laugh sounded. The two mighty figures did not sense that there was already someone inside the Great Dao of Extreme Origin.
 Nüwa said calmly, “I have no affinity with this Great Dao. I just suspect that the birth of this Great Dao is related to the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity.”
 “Hehe, Empress is still so kind and worried about the chaos.”
 “What about you, Daoist Destiny? Your supporter, Sage Fated Secrets, has already perished. You don’t care about him at all, but you’re here to care about the new Great Dao?”
 “So be it if your unfilial disciple is dead, but this Great Dao is fated with me. I advise you to forget it. Don’t fight with me, or I’ll be forced to not give the Dao Ancestor’s personal disciple face.”
 Nüwa did not reply. The depths of the chaos fell silent again.
 Han Jue was shocked. Sage Fated Secrets actually had such a background?
 He immediately used the system to check.
 (Daoist Destiny: Great Dao Divine Spirit, Chaotic Fiendcelestial]
 There were only two labels, but they looked terrifying
 It was even a Chaotic Fiendcelestial!
 as even
 Could it be formed by the Great Dao of Destiny?
 Han Jue thought silently.
 Nüwa and Daoist Destiny stopped talking. After a long time, they left.
 Han Jue continued his Dao Integration.
 It had to be said that the depths of the chaos truly broadened his horizons. Although there was nothing here, it was a place where the strongest ruled.
 He wanted to fuse with the Dao as soon as possible and leave this high-level map as soon as possible.
 It was better to stay in the Heavenly Dao Immortal World.
 Outside the 33rd Heaven, in the Universal Hall, the Sages gathered. Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du, South Extreme Heavenly Venerate, Heavenly Venerate Wufa, Qiu Xilai, Sect Master Tian Jue, Fuxitian, and Emperor Xiao had dark expressions. Empress Houtu sized up their expressions and understood.
 Empress Houtu said, “Since we can’t defeat the Dark Sage King, we can guard the Immortal World in peace. Not long ago, the Dark Sage King used the Reincarnation Mystic Realm to capture the living beings of the Immortal World. The Son of the Heavenly Dao and Han Jue’s son were also captured.”
 Hearing this, the South Extreme Heavenly Venerate’s eyes lit up. “Han Jue’s son has been captured. He should be taking action, right?”
 Qiu Xilai shook his head. “Not necessarily. Han Jue doesn’t care about his son at all. Otherwise, he would have long been taken into the Hundred Peak Immortal River.”
 “If Han Jue cared, he would have already sensed it. He didn’t show up, which means that he’s more afraid of the Dark Sage King than concerned about his son.”
 “Sigh, how can the damned Dark Sage King be so powerful?”
 “I contacted the teacher at the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End. He said that he can’t find the time to kill the Dark Sage King. The Deity Realm of the Ruins of End is also facing great trouble.”
 “It seems that there’s a huge faction behind the Dark Sage King. They are also attacking the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End and the Immortal World.”
 “That must be the case. However, I don’t know what faction they are from. Our level is not high enough. Take care of the Immortal World.”
 The Sages sighed. In the Immortal World, they were high and mighty, comparable to the Heavenly Dao. They were absolute experts. However, outside the Heavenly Dao, they would be no different from all the living beings in the Immortal World. They were all pawns that had to listen to their masters.
