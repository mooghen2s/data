 Han Jue frowned when he saw this line of words.
 He was still alive!
 It seemed that this fellow also hid a soul elsewhere.
 But it’s fine.
 Ancient Fiendish Yin being alive was not a threat. It was a good opportunity to intimidate the various factions!
 Most of the Connate lifeforms of the Ancient Race had intelligence. They could communicate, so they would probably spread the news.
 Ever since Jiang Dugu, continuous people kept coming to barge into the Dao Field. In the long run, what would happen?
 Han Jue kept a low profile and cultivated, but he was not afraid of being discovered.
 Nothing would happen as long as he was in the Dao Field!
 After thinking, Han Jue closed his eyes.
 He wasn’t in a hurry to curse Ancient Fiendish Yin. Cursing now would easily expose him.
 He would curse the guy to death in a few thousand years!
 On the other side.
 Han Zuitian stood on the hill and said smugly, “Do you see? This is the Hidden Sect’s power. You are not considered disciples yet. You need to cultivate well. You have already joined the strongest force in the world. However, if your cultivation is insufficient, you will not have the chance to return after being chased out!”
 The transformed living beings at the foot of the mountain nodded excitedly.
 They didn’t see Han Jue appear. They only saw Ancient Fiendish Yin being sent flying. Then, a huge shadow flashed past and Ancient Fiendish Yin turned into a bloody mist and died on the spot.
 Compared to them, the Hidden Sect disciples were very calm, including the Nether Race.
 Currently, they were all existences who pursued the Great Dao. They weren’t like Ancient Fiendish Yin who had to enter the world to fight for power. The situation was different.
 In the following years, the news of Ancient Fiendish Yin’s death quickly spread. It spread wider and wider. The severely injured Ancient Fiendish Yin couldn’t condense a new body in a short period of time. He had offended too many powerful enemies and did not even dare to show himself, causing the Ancient Race to be like scattered sand.
 The Hidden Sect and the Hundred Peak Immortal River’s names began to spread.
 Many Connate lifeforms in the Hundred Peak Immortal River communicated with the Connate lifeforms outside at the edge of the Dao Field, causing the two names, Hundred Peak Immortal River and Hidden Sect, to be known by the Connate lifeforms outside. They spread it by word of mouth. One spread to one, two to ten, and ten to ten thousand.
 The various providence sects also knew of the Hundred Peak Immortal River and the Hidden Sect’s existence.
 They had also seen the Hidden Sect during the Heavenly Race Banquet.
 However, they did not expect that the Hidden Sect actually hid a powerful existence that could easily kill Ancient Fiendish Yin!
 Two hundred Immortal Emperors and an almost invincible Pseudo-Sage below the Sages!
 In the middle were supreme geniuses like Jiang Yi and Dao Sovereign in the previous calamity!
 This force…
 They were ridiculously strong!
 Most importantly, the various forces did not know the Hidden Sect’s true background.
 432 years later.
 The Hundred Peak Immortal River welcomed visitors.
 “I’m the Sect Master of the Jie School, Jing Tiangong. I’m especially here to visit the Sect Master of the Hidden Sect. Can I meet you?”
 Jing Tiangong’s voice entered the Dao Field, causing Han Jue to open his eyes.
DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com He naturally wouldn’t kill this believer directly, but he couldn’t see him either.
 The three schools of the Dao Sect had a sensitive relationship. They were united to the outside world, but they had always been fighting internally. Once they formed a good relationship with someone, they would definitely offend the other two schools.
 The Heavenly Court wanted to form the entire Dao Sect, but it collapsed.
 Han Jue said, “Forget about meeting. Jie School Sect Master, our Hidden Sect doesn’t want to fight for power and has no intention of becoming friends with the various factions. We only want to cultivate.”
 Hearing this, Jing Tiangong couldn’t help but raise his eyebrows.
 The disciples accompanying him were all angry. In their ears, Han Jue didn’t give them face.
 However, they did not shout. After all, Jing Tiangong was here.
 With the Sect Master around, it was not their turn to speak.
 Jing Tiangong smiled and asked, “Then, can Fellow Daoist tell me your name?”
 “Han Jue, a nobody.”
 “Han Jue…”
 Jing Tiangong narrowed his eyes and pinched his fingers to deduce.
 Huh!
 Jing Tiangong seemed to have guessed something. He revealed a strange smile and said, “Fellow Daoist Han, if you pass by the Jie School in the future, remember to visit me. You don’t want to be disturbed, but I like to be disturbed the most.”
 With that said, Jing Tiangong turned around and left. The Jie School disciples followed closely behind.
 On the other side.
 Han Jue walked out of the Daoist temple. Disturbed by Jing Tiangong, he wasn’t in the mood to cultivate and wanted to take a walk.
 He suddenly thought of the Qilin egg in the cave.
 After thousands of years, not many Qilin eggs had hatched. Only a dozen or so. The other Qilin eggs were still being nurtured.
 Arriving at the cave, Han Jue appeared in front of the Reincarnation Avatar, Liu Bei.
 Liu Bei opened his eyes and hurriedly stood up to bow when he saw him.
 Han Jue looked at a sleeping Qilin in the tunnel. This Qilin was as big as an elephant and wore crimson scales. As it breathed, its nose emitted a scorching aura.
 “His potential is not bad. He has already reached the Grand Unity True Immortal Realm.”
 Han Jue praised. He looked into the cave and saw the figures of other Qilin, but their cultivation was far inferior to this crimson Qilin.
 Liu Bei smiled. “Its potential is indeed not bad. It can be considered the king of the Qilin Race. The other Qilins are all very afraid of it. Perhaps it’s the Qilin Race’s royal bloodline.
 “By the way, its name is Xu Lin. Would it be offensive for me to give it a name? If you’re not satisfied, you can give it a new name.”
 Han Jue said, “It’s fine. There’s no need to change it. Send it to my Daoist temple when it reaches the Grand Unity Golden Immortal Realm.”
 With that, Han Jue disappeared.
 Liu Bei heaved a sigh of relief.
 He was actually just testing it. Han Jue’s nonchalance was actually permission.
 He was grateful to him. He knew that Han Jue wanted him to control the Qilin Race and increase his authority in the Hidden Sect.
 Of course, he couldn’t forget that the true master of the Qilin Race was Han Jue!
 Immortal World, in the seas.
 There was still remnant negative karma of the Immeasurable Calamity. It floated on the sea like a black mist.
 On an island.
 Jing Tiangong and Huang Zuntian stood at the top of the mountain and looked into the distance.
 “Do you know Han Jue?” Jing Tiangong pretended to ask casually.
 ouarry.
 Huang Zuntian thought for a moment and said, “It sounds familiar. Let me think. I’ve met more than ten people called Han Jue in my life. The ones who left the deepest impression should be the Han Jue of the Eastern Dragon Region and the Han Jue of the mortal world.” “Oh? Tell me.”
 “Han Jue of the Eastern Dragon Region is a hidden cultivator who doesn’t belong to any sect. I don’t know if he’s still alive. Han Jue of the mortal world is an ascetic I encountered when I was a mortal. I suffered greatly in his hands.”
 Huang Zuntian shook his head and laughed as he recalled the past.
 Jing Tiangong asked, “How’s your relationship with Han Jue from the mortal world? Are you enemies?”
 Huang Zuntian said, “There are indeed grudges, but there are differences between mortals and immortals. The past is like smoke and mist, not worth mentioning.”
 He asked in surprise, “Sect Master, why are you asking about him? Did you encounter him? No way, he’s still alive after the calamity?”
 Jing Tiangong stared at him and smiled. “Nothing. I’m just asking. A mighty figure named Han Jue recently appeared in the Immortal World.”
 “Oh? Tell me the details?” Huang Zuntian pretended to be curious.
 Jing Tiangong told him about the Hidden Sect.
 Huang Zuntian sighed. “I didn’t expect the Hidden Sect’s master to also be called Han Jue. Wait, could it be that Han Jue of our mortal world?”
 He began to deduce with his fingers and frowned. “I can’t deduce it. As expected of a mighty figure.”
