 Han Jue stopped thinking about the bell and focused on cultivating.
 Next was to break through to the Five Mystic Divine Origin.
 Sometime later, the Emperor Ancestral Bell sounded from time to time.
 Thirty years passed in the blink of an eye.
 Han Jue was already very close to the Five Mystic Divine Origin. It hadn’t been 200 years since his last breakthrough. Fortunately, he had comprehended life and death previously and saved decades of bitter cultivation.
 After arriving at the Dark Forbidden Zone, the Hidden Sect Island was no longer disturbed. The disciples of the sect entered the cultivation stage again to prepare for the next hundred-year competition.
 Although there was no reward, they fought for reputation and attention.
 Anyone who made outstanding progress would definitely catch Han Jue’s eye and receive guidance. This was more attractive than rewards.
 Han Jue looked at the emails. Most of them were about someone being attacked, but a few were about obtaining opportunities.
 The Heavenly Dao had already given out most of the benefits. Next, it was time to make the people who entered the calamity go mad.
 Han Jue couldn’t help but admire the Heavenly Dao. People knew that it was dangerous, but they had no choice but to pounce in without hesitation.
 Fortunately, he was not trapped in the Heavenly Dao. Otherwise, he would have died sooner or later.
 Since ancient times, how many people had surpassed the Heavenly Dao?
 He continued to cultivate.
 Five years later.
 Li Yao had successfully become an Emperor and reached the Rank One Immortal Emperor Realm. She didn’t need to transcend the tribulation in the Dao Field.
 This matter caused a stir in the Hidden Sect. The Black Hell Demon Lord, Jiang Yi, and Diamond Rage sensed danger.
 These juniors’ potential was too strong. They had no choice but to work hard.
 Another ten years passed.
 Han Jue called Li Yao into the cave abode.
 Li Yao had just consolidated her cultivation realm and her temperament was even colder. However, she was very excited and looking forward to it.
 She was looking forward to Han Jue’s praise.
 Han Jue said, “A Rank One Immortal Emperor is not enough. You can’t be proud, understand?”
 Li Yao nodded.
 Han Jue said, “I’ll teach you another Mystical Power to increase your strength. I hope that you can grow up soon and protect the Hidden Sect Dao Field.”
 “Thank you, Sect Master. I won’t let you down!”
 Li Yao spoke very firmly. Although she was cautious by nature, she had already stayed in the Hidden Sect for a long time and had completely integrated into it. She felt a peace that she had never felt before here. She also did not want anything to happen to the Hidden Sect.
 Han Jue began to teach her the Mystical Power.
 A year later. Li Yao left the Connate Cave Abode. The others surrounded her and asked her what she had learned.
 “You’ll know during the next hundred-year competition,” Li Yao said.
 Everyone rolled their eyes.
Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates This woman looked indifferent, but she was extremely competitive.
 As expected of a woman!
 Eight years later.
 In the midst of cultivating, Han Jue sensed that Xing Hongxuan was using the Invocation Technique. He stepped into the black vortex and came to her chamber.
 Xing Hongxuan was the only one in the palace.
 Han Jue came to the bed and sat down. He looked at Xing Hongxuan.
 This time, she did not approach him without another word. Instead, she had a solemn expression on her face.
 “What’s wrong?” Han Jue asked.
 Xing Hongxuan bit her lips and said, “The humans have rushed to the Nine Heavens to prepare to attack the Heavenly Court!” Han Jue nodded. He was not surprised as he had already seen the situation.
 Xing Hongxuan asked, “The current Human Race’s Great Emperor has gathered all the cultivators above the Immortal Realm. I have to go too, but the Heavenly Court seems to have a close relationship with you. Husband, do you think I should go?”
 Compared to the will of the human race, she was more concerned about Han Jue’s attitude.
 Han Jue rolled his eyes and said angrily, “Why are you asking me now? I asked you to come back, but did you?”
 Xing Hongxuan curled her lips and said, “I want to grow up on my own. If I stay under you, I’ll always be your burden. If you care about the Heavenly Court, I won’t be their enemy.”
 Han Jue fell into deep thought.
 He only cared about the Heavenly Emperor, not the Heavenly Court.
 If Xing Hongxuan didn’t go, she would definitely be rejected by the humans.
 Han Jue said, “The Heavenly Court has a deep foundation. If you participate, it’s best to fish in troubled waters. Don’t be too serious. Protecting your life is the most important.”
 Xing Hongxuan rolled her eyes. “Actually, there’s another way to avoid it, but I’ve been worried.”
 “What way?”
 “I can go and try the mystic realm left behind by Sage Nüwa. If I succeed, the human race will support me and won’t dare to let me take any risks.”
 Xing Hongxuan’s tone was filled with anticipation.
 Han Jue frowned slightly.
 He instinctively wanted to reject, but he had already checked earlier. Nüwa only wanted to develop a good relationship with him. To a mortal like Xing Hongxuan, could there be a greater inheritance than one from a Sage?
 Xing Hongxuan seemed to see through Han Jue’s concerns and couldn’t help but say, “This is a mystic realm that has been passed down for a long time. It didn’t appear recently.”
 Han Jue asked, “You want to go?”
 Xing Hongxuan nodded seriously.
 She also wanted to become stronger!
 Han Jue said, “Then, I’ll teach you some Mystical Powers first.”
 Xing Hongxuan immediately beamed. She pounced into Han Jue’s arms and smiled. “Husband is the best. Impart them to me next month. For now, let’s…”
 “Kneel.”
 “Yes, husband!”
 A year later, Han Jue returned to the Connate Cave Abode.
 He sat on the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus and thought, “I want to know Xing Hongxuan’s situation after the calamity ends.”
 (A billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Eh?
 Why had it increased to a billion years?
 This was the price of deducing a Zenith Heaven!
 Han Jue immediately chose to continue. Immediately after, his consciousness entered the illusion.
 Han Jue opened his eyes again and came to the streets of a city. People came and went, and it was extremely bustling.
 Everyone was looking up at the sky.
 Han Jue also looked up and was shocked.
 Countless silver-armored soldiers floated in the air. All of them were extraordinary and looked like Heavenly Soldiers. There were also many human mighty figures meditating.
 Han Jue’s gaze passed through countless silver-armored soldiers and saw a golden bench above the sea of clouds. A blue-robed woman leaned on it.
 It was Xing Hongxuan!
 Xing Hongxuan’s blue robe was embroidered with dragons and phoenixes. Her face was exquisite and she wore a pearl crystal crown. Her gaze looked down on the world, looking down on it. Her eyes were mixed with disdain, joy, and spirit.
 Eh?
 What was going on?
 This woman became the Human Emperor?
 Han Jue was dumbfounded. Although Xing Hongxuan’s potential after reincarnation was not bad, he had never thought that this woman could really rise up.
 Han Jue wanted to continue watching when the scene shattered and his consciousness returned to reality. “That’s it? I didn’t see clearly. Is it really her?”
 Han Jue complained in his heart. He was very dissatisfied.
 Immediately after, another line of words appeared in front of him. It was Xing Hongxuan’s introduction.
 [Xing Hongxuan: Cultivation unknown. Immeasurable Emperor, Empress of the Human Race, disciple of a Sage, Dao Companion of the Sect Master of the Hidden Sect]
 That amazing?
 Her being the Immeasurable Emperor meant that Xing Hongxuan would enter the calamity and emerge victorious?
 Han Jue frowned. He didn’t know if he should be happy or worried. This should be the introduction of the future Xing Hongxuan. In other words, Xing Hongxuan would definitely succeed in exploring the Nüwa Mystic Realm.
