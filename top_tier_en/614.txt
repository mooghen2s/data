 Perhaps Han Tuo’s bloodline potential did not match his, but it was definitely stronger than all the living beings in the Heavenly Dao.
 Han Jue stared at him and muttered, “Don’t disappoint me. I hope you can become the second Primordial Fiendcelestial.”
 A strong light burst out from Han Tuo’s body. It was dazzling.
 At the same time, in the second Dao Field, Dong Zhuo and Murong Qi felt an aura rapidly becoming stronger.
ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels “That’s another Chaotic Fiendcelestial?” Murong Qi muttered curiously.
 He didn’t go to watch to avoid disturbing Han Jue.
 Ever since he had become the Combat Fiendcelestial, Murong Qi had been cultivating at a tremendous pace. He was far stronger than before. He was very excited and enjoyed every day of cultivation.
 He finally understood why Han Jue liked to cultivate so much.
 This feeling of becoming stronger was more wonderful than any experience in the world!
 Ten years passed in a flash.
 Han Tuo slowly woke up. He opened his eyes, and the first thing he saw was Han Jue, who was emitting divine light. He was still so high and mighty.
 With Han Jue’s help, Han Tuo had already removed the dark power in his body. He officially stepped onto the Great Dao of Extreme Origin and his potential had completely awakened.
 Han Tuo clearly felt that everything had changed.
 The world in his eyes became clearer. The flowing and invisible Connate Qi flowed in front of him like rivers.
 This feeling…
 Excited, Han Tuo hurriedly kowtowed to Han Jue.
 “Thank you, Father,” Han Tuo said in a low voice, his voice trembling.
 He could feel his potential transforming. With a breath, he could absorb Connate Qi and increase his cultivation.
 Too terrifying!
 Was this the Great Dao of a Sage?
 Han Jue didn’t even open his eyes as he said, “Try your best to stay in the Immortal World in the future. Don’t go out. There are many existences stronger than me outside the Immortal World watching. You have inherited my bloodline and will be targeted by many mighty figures.”
 Han Tuo nodded. He seemed to have thought of something and asked, “Where’s Yi Tian? He’s my sworn brother. You…”
 As a Sage, Han Jue definitely knew the people around him.
 “I didn’t save him.”
 “Why?”
 “He’s the Son of the Heavenly Dao. To be precise, he’s a pawn created by the Heavenly Dao Spirit. The Heavenly Dao Spirit is the intelligence born by the Heavenly Dao. If the Heavenly Dao has a spirit, it will definitely be a calamity. You understand this logic, so it’s impossible for me to save Yi Tian. If he grows up, he will only harm the Immortal World. You should have already sensed his bloodlust,” Han Jue said indifferently.
 Han Tuo was stunned.
 I see…
 No wonder I couldn’t catch up to him no matter what.
 Han Tuo smiled bitterly, but his eyes were still very firm.
 “He has his backing. You don’t have to worry. Cultivate here for now. You’re not allowed to leave,” Han Jue said. Although Han Tuo’s potential was freed, he was not strong enough. Han Tuo asked, “When can I leave?”
 “When you reach the Zenith Heaven Realm.”
 “Zenith Heaven…”
 Han Tuo raised his eyebrows. With his current potential, it was not difficult for him to reach the Zenith Heaven Realm!
 At this moment, Han Jue suddenly disappeared.
 Han Tuo was stunned. He stood up and wanted to walk out of the Daoist temple to take a look, but he still stopped.
 No!
 I can’t let him down!
 Han Tuo sat down again and started cultivating. On the other side.
 Han Jue returned to the Hundred Peak Immortal River. He looked up and saw that the Sages had already returned and were gathered in the Universal Hall.
 After thinking for a moment, he jumped out of the Immortal World and appeared at the Universal Hall outside the 33rd Heaven.
 Sensing his aura, the door to the Universal Hall opened.
 Han Jue walked into the hall and came in front of the Sages.
 “Fellow Daoist Han, you’ve finally appeared. We thought you hadn’t returned.”
 “Damn it, we were attacked on the way back. Fellow Daoist Fuxitian is gone…”
 “Who is behind the Dark Sage King?”
 “I’m not sure. I keep feeling that the Heavenly Dao’s danger isn’t over.”
 Hearing the Sages’ words, Han Jue glanced at them. Other than Fuxitian, the other Sages were all injured.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du’s expression was very ugly.
 Han Jue asked, “Are your injuries very
 serious?”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “A powerful force suppressed our Dao hearts. It will take us a long time to recover.”
 For a time, the hall fell silent.
 Han Jue asked, “Have you contacted your seniors in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End? What did they say?” “They want us to focus on managing the Heavenly Dao. Don’t think too much about it.” The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate sighed.
 Han Jue observed their expressions and couldn’t see through their thoughts.
 “I want to know if they know that the Dark Sage King was instructed by the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End?” Han Jue asked silently in his mind.
 (4 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 (No]
 Han Jue mourned.
 So these people were also pawns and were kept in the dark.
 It was normal. They were Heavenly Dao Sages. If something happened to the Heavenly Dao, they would all be buried with it.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du had descended later. If he knew about the schemes of the mighty figures, he would probably not come even if they beat him to death.
 “In that case, I can use them.”
 Han Jue thought silently. No matter what, they were on the same side in the matter of the Heavenly Dao.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “We can’t control the matter of Fuxitian. We should think of a way to increase the Heavenly Dao’s providence. The stronger the Heavenly Dao is, the safer we will be.”
 The Sages nodded and dispersed.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du sent a voice transmission to stop Han Jue from leaving.
 After the other Sages left, the door to the Universal Hall closed.
 “Something’s wrong. We have to hurry up and obtain the Earth Immortal World and nurture it into the Heavenly Dao,” Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said in a low voice.
 Han Jue asked, “You’re a Freedom Sage with deep experience. Why did you descend as a Heavenly Dao Sage?”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du sighed. “The Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity is about to arrive. I’m worried about the Heavenly Dao and the Human Race.”
 “Were you not arranged to be here?”
 “Of course. Otherwise, how can I let go of the grudge of you killing Li Muyi?” Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said snappily. The emotions he suddenly displayed pulled his relationship with Han Jue closer.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du added, “I already have a preliminary guess regarding the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity, but I can’t verify it for the time being. The reason why I’m targeting the Earth Immortal World is that I’m afraid that the Heavenly Dao will die. If that day really comes, we can still move all the Heavenly Dao beings to the Earth Immortal World, just like how the Dao Ancestor created the Immortal World in the past.”
 Han Jue’s impression of Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du changed.
 Not all cultivators only worked hard for the strongest. They had other ambitions.
 The two of them began to discuss how to develop the Reincarnation Space.
 The greatest resistance to the Reincarnation Space’s development now was the Chaotic Fiendcelestial and the Infinite Space hidden in the Earth Immortal World.
 Behind the Infinite Space was a Sage. He had severed three corpses to attain the Dao. He was stronger than a Heavenly Dao Sage, but he was inferior to a Sage who had used his own strength to attain the Dao.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du was once a Freedom Sage. Han Jue was also a Freedom Sage now, so they didn’t have to worry about the Infinite Space.
 They had to eliminate the Chaotic Fiendcelestial first!
