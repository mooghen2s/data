 When he comprehended his own Great Dao, Han Jue’s aura transformed. A wisp of black aura wrapped around his body, scaring the Strange Deity so much that it didn’t dare to approach. It hid in the corner shivering.
 At the same time.
 A ball of light appeared in the darkness and expanded.
 Figures appeared in the darkness and looked at the ball of light from afar.
 “A new Great Dao?”
 “I can’t figure it out. I wonder who created it.”
 “Perhaps the Great Dao developed naturally.”
 “It still has to wait for several Primordial Meetings or even longer before this Great Dao can form its own rules and produce its own living beings.”
 “Do you guys want this Great Dao? If this Great Dao is really created by a cultivator, it would be a waste of effort.”
 “Let’s wait and see.”
 Han Jue didn’t know that when he created the Great Dao, a new creation was appearing in the unknown darkness.
 He slowly opened his eyes.
 He could sense a new Great Dao power in the world of stars. It was shaped like a black mist and surged at the edge.
 This Great Dao combined the characteristics of the eight Fiendcelestials he had already grasped.
 Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial, Nine Yin Fiendcelestial, Wind Shaking Fiendcelestial, Shadow Flood Fiendcelestial, Void Fiendcelestial, Scarlet Clear Fiendcelestial, Weak Water Fiendcelestial, and Extreme Darkness Fiendcelestial!
 In the future, he could also inject more creation into the new Great Dao through other Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols.
 This would be an unprecedented Great Dao, and also the strongest Great Dao, because it combined the characteristics of other Great Dao.
 “Let’s call it the Great Dao of Extreme Origin,” Han Jue muttered to himself.
 Extreme was the limit, the limit of the three thousand Great Dao.
 Origin was the source, the source of the three thousand Great Dao.
 After fusing three thousand Great Dao, he could also create his own three thousand Great Dao!
 Somehow, Han Jue sensed that the Great Dao of Extreme Origin was responding to him and acknowledged this name.
 (Detected that this is your first time creating a Great Dao. You have the following choices:]
 (1: Impart the Dao and preach the Dao. Let all living beings cultivate the Great Dao of Extreme Origin. You can obtain a Mystical Power inheritance, a Great Dao Fragment, and a Supreme Treasure.]
 [2: Cultivate in a low profile manner and not reveal the existence of the Great Dao of Extreme Origin. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment and a random natural treasure.]
 I haven’t even made a name for myself. How can I preach the Dao now!
 Han Jue directly chose the second option.
 Once the Great Dao of Extreme Origin spread, it would definitely attract the suspicion of the Heavenly Dao Sages, Great Dao Spirits, and even Transcendent Dao Experts. Han Jue wasn’t stupid.
 (You chose to cultivate in a low profile manner and obtained a Great Dao Fragment and a random natural treasure.]
 [Congratulations on obtaining the Traceless Breeze Lotus.)
 (Traceless Breeze Lotus: Connate spiritual item. Traceless in the soil. Spreads billions of seeds and produces boundless Connate Qi.]
 Not bad. He could spread it outside the Hidden Sect Island and increase the nearby Connate
 Qi.
 As for the interior of the Dao Field, there was no need to increase the Connate Qi. It was already extremely dense.
 It just so happened that the disciples and Nether Race members could stay outside in the future. As for Hidden Sect Island, they could use it when escaping.
 Han Jue no longer needed Spirit Qi and Connate Qi for his cultivation. He only needed to absorb the negative karma in the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus.
 Han Jue stood up and jumped out of Hidden Sect Island.
 Arriving outside, he discovered that the surrounding trees were much fewer. Several tall palaces, Daoist temples, and other temples appeared a hundred steps away.
 Han Jue could sense the aura of the disciples. It seemed they had already found a place to stay.
 He took out the Traceless Breeze Lotus. It was a seed the size of a peanut. He threw it on the ground and, in the blink of an eye, the seed disappeared.
 Han Jue probed the soil with his divine sense and saw that the Traceless Breeze Lotus was quickly splitting.
 Next, he only needed to wait for the Traceless Breeze Lotus to grow.
 Han Jue revealed his aura. Under the concealment of the system, he suppressed his cultivation to Rank One Immortal Emperor.
 Soon, the disciples of the Hidden Sect gathered and knelt in front of him. Even Xing Hongxuan, Fairy Xi Xuan, and Chang Yue’er came.
 After that, there were Xun Chang’an, Dao Comprehension Sword, Li Yao, Tu Ling’er, Zhao Xuanyuan, Dao Sovereign, Jiang Yi, the Han brothers, the Black Hell Chicken, the Chaotic Heavenly Dog, Chu Shiren, Murong Qi, Diamond Rage, Lu Huaxu, Zhou Mingyue, and the others.
 No one believed Han Jue’s Rank One Immortal Emperor cultivation.
 Jiang Yi couldn’t help but recall his first meeting with him. He cursed in his heart. “Trying to lie again!”
 The Heavenly Dao’s living beings were all gone. Who was he trying to fool?
 Han Jue asked, “How do you feel about this area?”
 Murong Qi was the first to answer. “I heard that this was once the old land of the Qilin Race. It’s filled with Spirit Qi and is indeed suitable for survival. Grandmaster, do you want to give this area a name?”
 The others agreed.
 Without a name, they felt that they were missing something.
 They didn’t dare to make a decision.
 Han Jue thought for a moment and said, “Let’s call it the Hundred Peak Immortal River.”
 “What’s the meaning?” Jiang Yi asked.
 Han Jue glanced at him and said, “It’s meaningless.”
 Jiang Yi was stunned. Just as he was about to ask, the Black Hell Chicken shouted, “We’ll do as Master says! Jiang Yi, are you not convinced?
 “Master, let him kowtow for a hundred years and say that he was wrong!”
 Jiang Yi was furious. This dog-like chicken was too despicable!
 Han Jue said, “In the future, you will stay nearby while I stay in Hidden Sect Island. If you have anything, call me anytime. Almost all the living beings in the Heavenly Dao are dead. The ones who survived are all existences beyond the Deity Realm. If you encounter them, be careful. I will let Lü Bu and Ma Chao out to guard the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 “Don’t leave the Hundred Peak Immortal River unless you obtain my approval. Cultivate well. When a new Heavenly Dao lifeform appears, you will be like legends. This is the greatest opportunity after the calamity.”
 Han Jue’s words made everyone react differently. They had already guessed that this was the situation, but they were still shocked hearing it from him.
 Jiang Yi asked, “My Golden Crow Divine Clan is also extinct?”
 Han Jue said, “The Zenith Heaven might still be alive.”
 Zhao Xuanyuan’s expression turned pale. There were very few Zenith Heavens in the Human Race.
 Fairy Xi Xuan and Chang Yue’er seemed to have thought of something and became dejected.
Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com Han Jue noticed their expressions and said, “The Scarlet Cloud World is still there and is protected by me. Now, it’s called the Reroll World.”
 Lu Huaxu nodded, “That’s right. I came from the Reroll World. It doesn’t seem to be in the void. Some ascenders have mentioned that after leaving the Reroll World, they will encounter a terrifying fog that obstructs their progress.”
 Han Jue didn’t say much about where the Reroll World was.
 However, speaking of ascension, Han Jue remembered that he had never ascended.
 With his current cultivation, the tribulation of ascension was already meaningless. Ascension could only help those at a lower realm increase their cultivation. If the Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal ascended to a Pseudo-Sage, the other Zenith Heavens would have long thought of a way to ascend again.
 “Master, if we preach the Dao for the first batch of Heavenly Dao living beings, will we obtain immeasurable merit and even have a chance to become a Sage?”
 Zhao Xuanyuan’s eyes lit up.
 The others were also excited.
 They had heard many legends about Sages. Most Sages were only called Heavenly Dao Sages because they had great merit for all living beings!
