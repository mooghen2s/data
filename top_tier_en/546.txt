 (160 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Amazing!
 The strongest Heavenly Dao Sage was only worth 4 billion years of lifespan. It was obvious how strong Dijun was.
 Continue!
 Han Jue silently made his choice.
 [Not for the time being.)
 What did it mean by that?
 Could it be that there would be danger after entering the dream?
 Han Jue continued to ask.
 [This dream will not be dangerous for the time being.)
 Han Jue stopped when he saw this.
 Dijun was still spamming away.
 Han Jue chose to accept the dream.
 In the blink of an eye, he came to a dark universe. To be precise, it was a hall. It only revealed the images of the stars in the universe. It was magnificent.
 Han Jue saw Dijun sitting in front of a translucent chessboard. Dijun was as his name implied. He was indeed handsome and had a smile on his face. He had the calm temperament of a benevolent lord. He was quite different from the legendary image.
 At least in his impression, Dijun should be very dignified. From the portrait, he was not so gentle.
 Han Jue walked over and bowed.
 After all, the other party was his elder brother. He had to be polite.
 Dijun sized him up and praised him. “I didn’t expect the Heavenly Dao to have someone like you who used your strength to attain the Dao. You’re really impressive.”
 Han Jue said humbly, “Compared to a mighty figure like you, I’m nothing. Although I don’t know who you are, this dream makes me feel that you are unfathomable. I’m amazed.”
 Dijun stroked his beard and smiled. The two of them began to exchange pleasantries.
 Han Jue hated pleasantries the most, but the other party was far stronger than him. He could only be polite.
 He silently used the simulation trial to copy Dijun’s cultivation.
 After a long while…
 Dijun returned to the topic. “I came to visit you in your dreams this time. It’s regarding the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity. According to the Dao Ancestor’s message, the Primordial Fiendcelestial will rise in the Immortal World and lead the Chaotic Fiendcelestials to engulf the Great Dao. You are another variable. You’re either the Primordial Fiendcelestial or the person with the greatest hope of resisting it.”
 Han Jue asked in surprise, “What is a Primordial Fiendcelestial?”
 “Before the creation of the world, there was Chaos. Before Chaos was the Primordial Chaos. You can understand it as a generation older than Pangu and the Dao Ancestor. We suspect that before the birth of Chaos, there was a flourishing era that was even more prosperous. It was the era of the Primordial Fiendcelestial. However, for some reason, the Primordial Chaos shattered and created Chaos. After that, Chaos stepped on the path of the Primordial Chaos and was torn apart by the Chaotic Fiendcelestials, producing the Great Dao and the Heavenly Dao.”
 “So the Primordial Fiendcelestial is very strong?”
 “That’s right.”
 “I’m not a Primordial Fiendcelestial, and I don’t want to fight it. It’s too dangerous…”
 Han Jue frowned and looked very nervous.
 Dijun wasn’t surprised. He smiled and said, “No one is stronger than you in the current Heavenly Dao. The Primordial Fiendcelestial shouldn’t have grown yet or even been born.”
 Han Jue asked in surprise, “Since it’s not born yet, why are you looking for me? To remind me? To kill the Primordial Fiendcelestial in its infancy?”
 “That’s right!”
 Dijun’s gaze became sharp.
 Han Jue felt an indescribable pressure. This pressure was not strong enough, but it made him very uncomfortable.
 Dijun stared at him and said, “Han Jue, do you dare to accept this mission? If you succeed, I will give you an unparalleled opportunity to escape the illusion.”
 Escape the illusion?
 Han Jue suddenly recalled that many years ago, when he dreamed of a giant, he had mentioned something similar.
 It was as if Han Jue was in an illusion.
T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by nov(ê(l)biin.co/m Now that Dijun also said that, what did that mean?
 Han Jue was about to ask when Dijun said, “I know what you want to ask. Our realms are different. You will understand when you touch the Great Dao.”
 Han Jue frowned. “What are the characteristics of the Primordial Fiendcelestial?”
 Dijun shook his head. “No one knows about the Primordial Fiendcelestial. We who have attained the Great Dao have never seen the Primordial Fiendcelestial, either. The Primordial Fiendcelestial is only a concept suggested by the Dao Ancestor. Perhaps it doesn’t really exist, but there will definitely be living beings leading the Great Dao Calamity. Just wait patiently.”
 Han Jue pretended to think.
 Who was the Primordial Fiendcelestial?
 What could the Primordial Fiendcelestial be?
 Han Jue directly blocked his memories and didn’t dare to remember that he was the Primordial Fiendcelestial.
 Dijun was an existence that surpassed Sages. Han Jue had to be careful.
 He even had to pretend in his mind!
 “You can visit me if you come to the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End in the future.” After saying that, Dijun waved his hand.
 The dream shattered.
 Han Jue’s consciousness returned to reality.
 He secretly heaved a sigh of relief.
 Who would go to the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End?!
 “I’m finally invincible in the Immortal World. How can I switch to a high-level map and get beaten up?
 “It seems that I can’t expose the Primordial Fiendcelestial’s identity. Otherwise, it will be too dangerous.”
 Han Jue thought silently. He even made up his mind not to leave the Heavenly Dao.
 It was too dangerous outside!
 The Heavenly Dao was still the best. He was about to break through.
 He could do whatever he wanted when he grasped the Heavenly Dao’s providence!
 “The Primordial Fiendcelestial who unifies the Chaotic Fiendcelestials. Isn’t that me?”
 Han Jue knew his limits. He would actually trigger the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity?
 Something was wrong!
 “If that’s the case, why does the Dao Ancestor trust me, a variable?
 “I want to know, does the Dao Ancestor think I’m a Primordial Fiendcelestial?”
 [It involves an existence that surpasses the system’s limits. It is impossible to deduce.)
 Amazing
 Han Jue raised his eyebrows. The Dao Ancestor’s realm was truly unfathomable.
 He had thought that the Dao Ancestor was the limit of the Heavenly Dao. He knew from Dijun that it was far more than that.
 Han Jue changed his mind and asked, “Who thinks I’m the Primordial Fiendcelestial?”
 (180 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Really?
 Han Jue immediately chose to continue.
 A figure appeared in his mind, and lines of words appeared in front of him.
 (Seven Dao Sage]
 This fellow…
 Han Jue suddenly became nervous. The Seven Dao Sage’s Dharma idol was in the Dao Field. It was Zhou Fan.
 Could it be that the Seven Dao Sage was spying on him?
 Han Jue immediately asked.
 (180 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [Not for the time being.)
 “Then, why does he think I’m a Primordial Fiendcelestial?”
 [Guess]
 This time, his lifespan was not deducted.
 Han Jue frowned and asked uneasily, “Is the Seven Dao Sage harming me?”
 [Not for the time being.]
 Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief.
 Four questions at once. Although two did not deduct his lifespan, it was still a lot.
 It had to be said that Han Jue panicked just now. He could use a more perfect way to ask. Han Jue immediately sent a voice transmission to Zhou Fan.
 Soon, he came to visit.
 Zhou Fan asked excitedly, “Master, are you teaching me a Mystical Power?”
 Han Jue said calmly, “You’re already a Zenith Heaven cultivator. Do you want to go out and train?”
 Zhou Fan was stunned. He asked in surprise, “Isn’t it only possible for a Pseudo-Sage to go out?”
 “The Heavenly Devil Calamity has been eliminated. The Sages established the Chaotic City in the 33rd Heaven. The disciples of the various sects will go. I want you to represent the Hidden Sect.”
 “Chaotic City? Alright! I’ll go!” Zhou Fan’s eyes lit up, and he immediately replied.
 The 33rd Heaven was the territory of the Sages.
 Furthermore, this matter could represent the Hidden Sect. He could make contributions!
 “Yes, prepare well.”
 “No need. I can go at any time.”
 Han Jue immediately waved his sleeve and sent him out.
 After Zhou Fan left, Han Jue sent dreams to Qiu Xilai, the South Extreme Heavenly Venerate, Sect Master Tian Jue, Fuxitian, and Emperor Xiao, telling them that Zhou Fan would represent the Hidden Sect in the Chaotic City.
 The reason why he informed all the Sages was that Han Jue was afraid that some Sages would cause trouble and scheme against Zhou Fan. Of course, even if they did, they couldn’t defeat the Seven Dao Sage.
