 The world rumbled as the golden ruler in the Three Pure Sacred Ancestor’s hand shattered. The Nine Lotus Dharma Idol behind him was destroyed.
 The Three Pure Sacred Ancestor’s expression changed drastically as he retreated again.
 The Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial did not continue attacking. Instead, it looked at him coldly as its figure dissipated like smoke.
 The sea of clouds exploded and swept away the clouds. Mountains and rivers collapsed and dust flew into the air. In this world-destroying scene, the Three Pure Sacred Ancestor stood in the world with a livid expression.
 His right hand trembled as the shattered golden ruler condensed again. However, he no longer attacked the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 The Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial was too powerful!
 It was so strong that he did not dare to act rashly anymore.
 “Who is he?”
 The Three Pure Sacred Ancestor thought uneasily, “When did such a figure appear in the Immortal World?”
 On the other side.
 Han Jue was also depressed.
 Why was this fellow like the Heavenly Dao Sage? He really couldn’t be killed.
 Since he couldn’t kill the guy, Han Jue deliberately retreated and created an illusion of intimidation.
 As expected, the million living beings of the Hundred Peak Immortal River became excited.
 The powerful Three Pure Sacred Ancestor was actually repelled by two punches. The Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial was too strong! “Who was that just now?”
 “I’m not sure. Could it be the Sect Master?”
 “No, Sect Master’s figure isn’t like this. He should be a mighty figure of the Hidden Sect.”
 “Those personal disciples are indeed very strong.”
 “That’s right. Previously, the First Guardian swept through all the powerful enemies around the Hundred Peak Immortal River.”
 “Even Sages can’t enter the Hundred Peak Immortal River? Our Hidden Sect is really too strong!”
 On the hill, the three immortals were extremely excited.
 The Heavenly Immortal said excitedly, “Brother, you have good judgment. Our Hidden Sect is definitely the strongest force in the Immortal World!”
 Eagle Head Immortal was also very excited, but he still restrained himself. He snorted. “When has Big Brother ever misjudged? Let’s serve the Hidden Sect well. In the future, we might be able to reach the cultivation level of that personal disciple just now!”
 Almost all the in-name disciples treated Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial as Han Jue’s personal disciple.
 The personal disciples knew that it was only Han Jue’s Dharma idol.
 No one knew how many Dharma Idols Han Jue had.
 Li Daokong had encountered Han Jue’s nine Dharma Idols in the simulation trial. They all had Mystical Powers and had left a deep impression of him.
 In the end, the Three Pure Sacred Ancestor left.
 The Hidden Sect survived another crisis that was not a crisis.
 Han Jue returned to the Daoist temple and sat on the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus. He asked in his mind, “How can I kill the Three Pure Sacred Ancestor?”
 (3 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 (Fight outside the Heavenly Dao, or cut off his Heavenly Dao providence.)
 Han Jue fell into deep thought.
 Kidnap the Three Pure Sacred Ancestor and bring him out?
 However, if he went out, he would face the attack of the Sages.
 As for severing the Heavenly Dao’s providence, Han Jue didn’t know such a technique for the time being.
 Forget it.
 He would keep him for now.
 He had to attain the Dao first!
 Han Jue stopped thinking and continued cultivating
 After the Three Pure Sacred Ancestor attacked, the Sages would probably not find trouble with him anymore.
 Outside the 33rd Heaven, Sage Dao Field.
 Li Muyi, South Extreme Heavenly Venerate, Sect Master Tian Jue, and Sage Jin’an fell silent with different expressions.
Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com After a long while…
 Sage Jin’an couldn’t help but ask, “Is that a Sage’s Dharma Idol?”
 The Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial was so strong that even Sages were shocked!
 Li Muyi’s eyes flickered. “It’s not a Sage’s Dharma Idol. It’s more like…”
 The three Sages glanced at him, waiting for him to continue.
 Li Muyi took a deep breath and continued, “I’ve heard from my master that before the creation of the world, Chaotic Fiendcelestials existed. The Chaotic Fiendcelestials who survived would either split the world apart or become the earliest Great Dao Divine Spirit. The one who protected the Hidden Sect might be a Chaotic Fiendcelestial!”
 Chaotic Fiendcelestial?
 South Extreme Heavenly Venerate asked in surprise, “Why is the Chaotic Fiendcelestial hiding in the Immortal World? It’s impossible that the Dao Ancestor doesn’t know. Could it be that a Great Dao Divine Spirit wants to invade the Immortal World?”
 Sect Master Tian Jue and Sage Jin’an’s eyelids twitched.
 The higher one stood, the more they knew.
 They were invincible existences below the Heavenly Dao, but the Heavenly Dao was not the only thing in the vast Chaos. There were also some ancient and mysterious Great Dao Divine Spirits. After the previous Sages transcended, they headed to the unknown Dark Forbidden Zone and never returned. They either went to the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End or the unknown Chaotic Domain.
 It would be troublesome if the one protecting the Hidden Sect was really a Chaotic Fiendcelestial.
 “Wait! Dao Ancestor is talking about the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity. Could it be…” Sage Jin’an suddenly thought of something and said in fear.
 The other three Sages were shocked, including Li Muyi.
 Li Muyi stood up and said, “I have to ask the ancestor about this.”
 The other Sages also stood up.
 At this moment…
 Qiu Xilai and Emperor Xiao suddenly appeared in the hall.
 Emperor Xiao’s expression darkened. “Which one of you is being cursed?”
 Sage Jin’an said, “Me. What’s wrong? Are you also being cursed?”
 Sect Master Tian Jue nodded. “Me too.”
 South Extreme Heavenly Venerate snorted. He was very unhappy to see Emperor Xiao and Qiu Xilai standing together.
 Li Muyi frowned and looked at them. It was unknown what he was thinking.
 Qiu Xilai snorted. “Recently, the Dark Forbidden Lord has started cursing us again. We have to investigate this matter clearly. Otherwise, there will be no end of trouble!”
 Emperor Xiao glanced at the four Sages of the Dao Sect and asked, “What are you plotting? You’ll rope in variables one moment and target them the next. What do you want?”
 Emperor Xiao felt that the Four Sages of the Dao Sect were very suspicious!
 Qiu Xilai narrowed his eyes, clearly wanting to ask the same.
 Seeing that he had come with ill intentions, Li Muyi said, “Let’s put aside the matter of the Dark Forbidden Lord for the time being. The Great Dao Calamity has just begun to show some clues. We have to visit Ancestor Xitian first.”
 “Heh, don’t change the topic! Are you really forcing me to use the Dao Destruction Mystical Power?”
 Qiu Xilai was furious. In the previous calamity, the Buddhist Sect had suffered heavy losses. He had been suppressing his anger.
 Li Muyi wasn’t someone to be trifled with. He said coldly, “Qiu Xilai, do you suspect that the Dark Forbidden Lord is hidden among us? How ridiculous. We are the orthodox Dao Sect. How can we use such low-level methods?”
 For a time, the atmosphere in the hall became extremely tense.
 Another 300 years had passed since the Three Pure Sacred Ancestor attacked.
 Han Jue was still cultivating and attempting to attain the Dao.
 Suddenly sensing something, he probed the world of stars in the depths of his soul with his divine sense. His expression changed.
 The Great Dao Purple Qi that had been placed in the world of stars had unknowingly arrived in front of the 49 Fiendcelestial Qi. It split into many branches that connected to the Fiendcelestial Qi.
 With the help of the Great Dao Purple Qi, the speed at which the Fiendcelestial Purple Qi condensed seemed to increase.
 Wait!
 Could it be that the Great Dao Purple Qi could help him produce the Chaotic Fiendcelestials?
 Han Jue’s heart beat faster. He was a little excited.
 To prevent any accidents, he placed the Six Paths Insignia into the Fiendcelestial Qi, just in case.
 The Six Paths Insignia was created by Immortal Emperor Samsara. This Mystical Power was already very exquisite. In addition to Han Jue using it, as long as the other party’s cultivation level was not higher than his, it was basically impossible to escape his control.
