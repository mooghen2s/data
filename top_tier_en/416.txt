 “The humans are too arrogant. Our Heavenly Court protected them and slaughtered demons and devils for them. We even adjusted the weather to alleviate disasters. And they’re actually treating us like this.” “That’s right. When the Demon Court attacked the humans, wasn’t it our Heavenly Court who saved them?”
 “Such ingrates. With the support of a Sage, they want to go against the Immortal Gods?”
 “Our Heavenly Court is an orthodox sect. How can we be afraid of a Sage?”
 “That’s right, we can also seek the support of a Sage!”
 The immortals discussed and united against a common enemy. Fang Liang was originally a human and did not want to see humans and immortals become mortal enemies. But now, he had to make a choice.
 Perhaps this was the Immeasurable Calamity. It was not only a battle, but also a choice between life and death, Dao, and righteousness.
 Fang Liang’s eyes gradually became firm. He raised his hand to signal everyone to be quiet.
 All the immortals looked at him.
 Fang Liang said, “Prepare to declare war on the humans. Since the Immeasurable Calamity wants humans to fight with gods, the Heavenly Court can’t retreat. We can only fight!” The immortals agreed.
 Even if the Heavenly Court declined, the bottom line of immortals was not something mortals could touch!
 Fifteen years later.
 Han Jue was still absorbing the negative karma in the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus when four lines of words suddenly appeared in front of him.
 [Detected that the battle for providence in the Immeasurable Calamity is about to begin. You have the following choices:]
 (1: Join the human race and kill gods and immortals. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment and a Mystical Power inheritance.]
 [2: Join the Heavenly Court and show off your might. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment and a random natural treasure.]
 [3: Cultivate in a low-profile manner and stay away from trouble. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment and a Supreme Treasure.]
 Han Jue was stunned.
 The battle for providence had begun?
 Could it be that the final battle of this calamity was the battle between the humans and the Heavenly Court?
 Wait.
 Could it be that fate had arrived?
 The more Han Jue thought about it, the more he shivered. If all of this was destined, then the Demon Court, the Divine Palace, the Buddhist Sect, the Golden Crow Divine Clan, the Dragon Court, and the Underworld were all cannon fodder?
 Han Jue immediately chose the third option.
T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by nov(ê(l)biin.co/m [Congratulations on obtaining a Great Dao Fragment and a Supreme Treasure.]
 [Constitution Mystic Boots: Zenith Heaven Supreme Treasure, a Supreme Treasure derived from Chaotic Qi. It can ignore the power of rules and move freely. It has a restriction to resist the divine sense attack of a Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal.)
 This treasure was not bad!
 He had also accumulated six Great Dao Fragments.
 Han Jue took out the Constitution Mystic Boots and started to make it recognize him as its owner.
 His thoughts drifted.
 The master of the Heavenly Court was his grand-disciple, Fang Liang. The future Human Emperor of the Human Race was Xing Hongxuan…
 Both leaders were his…
 Unknowingly, Han Jue was so powerful.
 He stopped and looked back. He couldn’t help but feel as if he was in a dream.
 Back then, he only wanted to have more ways to survive by taking in disciples. He didn’t expect to reach this point step by step.
 “I really became the Dark Forbidden Lord,” Han Jue muttered and smiled helplessly.
 However, he did not regret it.
 So what if he was the Dark Forbidden Lord? As long as he could continue living and pursue the Great Dao, he was willing to be the Dark Forbidden Lord.
 Of course, he could only admit it verbally.
 Too many dogs had framed their sins on the Dark Forbidden Lord. It was simply shameless.
 Even today, there were still many people in the Immortal World cursing the enemy. Many of Han Jue’s good friends were cursed by a mysterious curse, including Fang Liang, Ji Xianshen, Zhou Fan, and others.
 He had to survive this calamity first.
 The next morning.
 Han Jue put on the Constitution Mystic Boots and used the Dark Nightmare to send a dream to Xing Hongxuan.
 In the dream, the two of them were alone in the forest.
 Han Jue sat beside her and said softly, “The true calamity has arrived. This time, the protagonists of the calamity are the humans and the Heavenly Court. One of them will definitely win. You have to be careful.”
 Xing Hongxuan nodded. “Don’t worry. I won’t participate if I can.”
 Han Jue asked, “Who do you think will win?”
 “I’m not sure. I don’t understand the Heavenly Court, but the human elders are full of confidence. I saw that Sage’s avatar. He’s indeed powerful. Just looking at him makes me inexplicably nervous.”
 Xing Hongxuan sighed upon the mention of Fuxitian.
 Sages were too distant from her. In the past, she had thought that Sages were only cultivators with stronger Dharmic powers. Only when she saw Fuxitian did she realize that this was not the case.
 Facing a Sage, she couldn’t even be rebellious or profane. Her soul trembled in front of him.
 Han Jue secretly guessed that the Heavenly Court would also have the help of a Sage. Otherwise, they would definitely be defeated and might not even be able to achieve the cleansing effect that the Heavenly Dao expected.
 In Han Jue’s opinion, the so-called calamity was a reshuffling of the heavens. When the number of lives reached the limit, the Heavenly Dao’s providence would change, attracting all living beings to fight and return peace to the world.
 Xing Hongxuan asked curiously, “Husband, will you support the Heavenly Court?” She had heard that the current Heavenly Emperor was Fang Liang. She had seen Fang Liang’s potential before. Han Jue also had a good relationship with the Heavenly Emperor. It was impossible for their names to be coincidental. They had to be the same person.
 Han Jue said expressionlessly, “I don’t support anyone.”
 Xing Hongxuan smiled. “As expected of you.”
 Eh?
 Why did this sound wrong?
 Xing Hongxuan didn’t continue on this topic. Instead, she began to talk about her experiences during this period of time.
 Apart from cultivation, she had also followed the humans and fought everywhere. More and more ancient races had been attacked by humans. In the battles, the cultivation of the human prodigies had constantly increased. It was extremely miraculous.
 Xing Hongxuan guessed that it was done by a Sage, while Han Jue thought that it was caused by the calamity.
 In the calamity, breaking through and cultivation was faster than during peaceful times. Unconsciously, the Heavenly Dao was pushing everything. Xing Hongxuan continued to talk, and Han Jue spent most of the time listening.
 This dream lasted for a long time.
 After returning to reality, Han Jue took out the Book of Misfortune and started cursing Jade Emperor Zhou Yan.
 Jade Emperor Zhou Yan had already lost his mind, but there had been no movement recently. He couldn’t let down his guard.
 This fellow was probably recuperating in a corner. He had to take his life when he was down.
 This time, Han Jue cursed with 50 billion years.
 He would slowly grind him to death.
 Several days later.
 Han Jue released the Strange Deity and continued to absorb negative karma.
 At the same time.
 Under the Fusang Tree.
 Everyone surrounded Lu Huaxu. His body emitted wisps of purple aura and his long hair fluttered. A terrifying and oppressive aura was brewing
 “What’s wrong with him?” Xun Chang’an asked curiously.
 Murong Qi narrowed his eyes and said, “He’s awakening the power of his previous life. This aura…”
 Chu Shiren said firmly, “One of the Four Extreme Emperors of the Heavenly Court, the Purple Star Emperor!”
 Murong Qi glanced at him, secretly unhappy.
 Why was this fellow always so talkative?
 Do you think that only you know?
 Dao Comprehension Sword asked curiously, “IS the Purple Star Emperor very powerful?”
 Chu Shiren said, “He’s on par with the Heavenly Emperor. You tell me, is he powerful or not?”
