 “Oh? Then, I’ll send more disciples. The agreement is as before.”
 “No, we agreed on a one-on-one fight!” Divine Lord Peacock hurriedly changed his words. Although he was conceited, he was not stupid. Han Jue was so confident and definitely had sinister methods. How could he let himself fall into an unfair situation? Han Jue smiled. This fellow was interesting. “Then don’t leave. Wait for him to find you.”
 “How long?”
 “You can cultivate in seclusion first. You have nothing to do, anyway.” Divine Lord Peacock said impatiently, “Alright, I’ll wait for you!” He forcefully shattered the dream again. Han Jue opened his eyes and smiled. He still wanted to subdue Divine Lord Peacock, so he stabilized him. Han Jue opened the emails and checked his circle of friends.

 The battle at the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End had begun! Seeing Pan Xin being beaten, Han Jue was quite surprised. Being able to survive meant that Pan Xin was already very strong. He checked his profile picture. [Pan Xin: Late-stage Primordial Chaos Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal, descendant of Pangu, one of the first living beings after creation. He has experienced the Immeasurable Calamity and was playing in the mortal world. Afraid of being discovered by the ancient Master of Calamity, he infiltrated the Sword Dao River. Because of your nature, he is interested in you. Current favorability: 3 stars] Late-stage Primordial Chaos Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm! This leveling speed was too ridiculous! There was also the providence label of Pangu’s descendant. It was really impressive. He was only a Primordial Chaos Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal. How could he withstand the siege of a Great Dao Sage? Could it be that Pangu’s Power was protecting Pan Xin?
 Han Jue didn’t spend his lifespan deducing but continued to check his emails. Ancestor Xitian was entangled by bad luck and lost 300 billion years of his lifespan. It was fine. It was just a drizzle. Han Jue didn’t care much about lifespan if it was just hundreds of millions now.
 An existence like Ancestor Xitian still had an endless lifespan, right? Perhaps this was the definition of immortality. The reason why he was immortal was that his lifespan had reached the upper limit?
 The concept of eternal life was vague. What was eternal life?
 Live on forever? How long was forever? Han Jue thought about it and continued reading the emails. After he finished reading the emails, he immersed himself in cultivation again.
 Outside the 33rd Heaven, Heavenly Dao Palace. Fang Liang sat on the lotus throne with a white-robed man kneeling in front of him. The white-robed man asked, “Master, when will you attempt Dao Integration?” Fang Liang replied, “I won’t do it.” Won’t do it?
 The white-robed man was stunned.
 In order to attain Dao Integration, Fang Liang had arranged many things. As the Sect Master of the Heavenly Dao Sect and Fang Liang’s personal disciple, the white-robed man had been preparing all these years, waiting for Fang Liang to reach the Dao Integration Realm. But Fang Liang suddenly changed his mind? This was not the way of a Sage! Fang Liang stared at his disciple, feeling helpless and afraid. Thinking back, he was terrified. He had almost sacrificed himself for the Dao Ancestor! After going through the Primordial Heavenly Prison, Fang Liang only eliminated the Dao Ancestor’s control over his thoughts. As for his absolute loyalty to Han Jue, he was the most grateful to him and would never become enemies with him, so he didn’t change much. Fang Liang said, “Let’s not talk about the Dao Integration for now. Send orders to the disciples of the Heavenly Dao Sect to preach in the various new mortal worlds. Next, the Heavenly Dao Sect will help all living beings of the Heavenly Dao become stronger. This is what the Sages are seeking.” Although he was puzzled, the white-robed man still agreed. Fang Liang closed his eyes, and the white-robed man bowed and left. Five minutes later. A voice floated over, “Fellow Daoist Fang, can we talk?”
 Fang Liang opened his eyes and focused. The array formation of the Dao Field closed and Emperor Xiao entered the hall. The array formation of the Dao Field activated, blocking all Sage Sense and voices. Fang Liang waved his sleeve, and a mat appeared in front of him.
 Emperor Xiao sat down and asked, “What do you think of the Calamity Race?” Fang Liang’s expression did not change as he asked, “Why do you ask?” Emperor Xiao said, “The Calamity Race offended us, and countless living beings of the Heavenly Dao died. Now that the battle has stopped, no matter how I look at it, it looks like the Heavenly Dao has compromised. I’m worried that the Calamity Race will cause trouble in the future.” Fang Liang said, “But if we continue fighting, the Heavenly Dao will suffer even more losses. The Calamity Race is stronger than all the living beings in the Heavenly Dao. This is a fact. We have to admit it. We will treat it as a humiliation and encourage all the living beings in the Heavenly Dao to become stronger.”
 “Sigh. There are so many living beings in the Heavenly Dao, but they were actually defeated by a race. How laughable.”
 “Fellow Daoist Xiao, you don’t have to blame yourself. After all, the Heavenly Dao has only been restarted for a little more than ten thousand
 years.”
 Emperor Xiao began to complain to Fang Liang, who kept comforting him.
 After an hour, Emperor Xiao left. Fang Liang’s expression turned cold. “This fellow actually dares to mock my Grandmaster. He’s really tired of living.”
 A thousand years passed. Han Jue’s cultivation level increased again. It had been nearly twenty thousand years since his last breakthrough. He was a little unhappy that he hadn’t broken through after so long and felt inexplicably terrified.
 Could he have become mediocre?
 Han Jue shook his head. He couldn’t think like that. He had to be confident. After all, Divine Lord Peacock was still waiting for him to subdue him outside the Heavenly Dao. He was about to check the emails when Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du’s voice floated over.
 “Fellow Daoist Han, can you come to the Universal Hall?”
 Hearing this, Han Jue immediately moved forward.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du rarely looked for him. It was usually something big when he did. In the Universal Hall.
 Han Jue arrived. There were only the two of them in the hall.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du was the first to speak, “It’s not good!” Han Jue asked, “What is it?”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said in a low voice, “The mighty figures of the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End did not block the existence in the Ancient Desolate. Now that the array formation of the Ancient Desolate has been completely destroyed, countless evil demons have escaped. The Great Dao Sages have already evacuated the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End. I’m worried that this matter will affect the Heavenly Dao.” Han Jue was not surprised. When he read the emails, he often saw that the ancestor was severely injured. It was obvious that the existence in the Ancient Desolate was stronger. But then again, was the Chaotic Deity’s power of order so strong? He could actually help the Ancient Desolate suppress so many existences stronger than him! “In addition, do you remember Pan Xin?” Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du asked. “We’ve met a few times. What happened to him?”
 “He obtained the inheritance of Pangu’s will and his cultivation level rose steadily. It’s said that he inherited the Great Dao of Strength and is preparing to walk the path of the Giant God Pangu. He wants to kill all the Chaotic Fiendcelestials and obtain the Great Dao of Chaos!”
