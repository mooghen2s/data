 Han Yu subconsciously rejected him. He had seen Han Tuo before. He was very annoying and pretentious.
 Han Yu suddenly thought of something, and his expression shook. His body couldn’t help but tremble.
 The painful memories that had been sealed in the depths of his heart appeared. Back then, when he was in the greatest despair, he had begged his ancestor Han Tuo to save the Han family. Han Tuo had not replied to him. While he was filled with anger and hatred, a savior he had never imagined appeared.
 It was his ancestor’s ancestor!
 After so many years, Han Yu had also tried to find his life-saving ancestor, but he had never found him.
 So…
 He has been taking care of me all along. He even gave me a cultivation technique. Han Yu was touched and aggrieved. Although he already had descendants, in front of his ancestors, he would always be a child.
 Seeing Han Yu’s eyes turn red, Han Jue had a headache.
 He hated such emotional scenes the most! “Since you know who I am, you also know why I helped you. Now, you should also understand why Nüwa is looking for you,” Han Jue snorted and said sternly.
 Han Yu’s emotions were interrupted. He was a Deity Realm existence, after all. He naturally wouldn’t act like a child anymore. He was no fool. There was no love in the world without a reason. Why did Nüwa look for him? Did she really think highly of his talent? [Han Yu’s favorability towards you has increased. Current favorability: 6 stars]
 Han Yu took a deep breath and said, “Nüwa told me that the Heavenly Dao Sages are not really doing this for the good of the Heavenly Dao. She was plotted against by the Sages and had no choice but to pretend to die. She wanted to nurture me to become a Sage and let me lead the Human Race to ascend to the Heavenly Dao Race again.”
 Nüwa still remembered the humans?
 In Han Jue’s impression, Nüwa cared more about the demons than humans.
 Otherwise, with the backing of a Sage, how could the Human Race be in trouble? Han Jue asked in his mind, “Is what Han Yu said true?”
 (50 million years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [Nüwa did tell him that.]
 Han Jue looked at him and said, “Since we’ve already acknowledged each other, I’ll preach the Dao for you.” Han Yu was pleasantly surprised and hurriedly thanked him.
 Han Jue immediately used the Great Dao of Extreme Origin to drown Han Yu’s consciousness, making him immersed in the vastness of the Great Dao. After a certain period of time…
 Han Yu opened his eyes. It was as if he had a dream. Once he woke up, the world he knew had already changed drastically.
 With Han Jue’s help, he could be considered to have truly come into contact with the Great Dao. Although he had yet to truly step into the Great Dao of Extreme Origin, he had at least laid the foundation.
 After comprehending the Great Dao, Han Yu’s senses and thoughts changed drastically. His entire temperament also became much more stable.
 Han Yu suddenly thought of something and muttered with a vexed expression, “I forgot to ask for my ancestor’s name… Sigh.” Although it was a sigh, Han Yu quickly smiled. In the past, he always felt lonely. Now that he saw Han Jue, he understood that he also had someone to care about. His heart was warm.
𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com He thought of Han Tuo again. Hmph!
 Just you wait, I will definitely surpass you! Han Yu’s eyes burned with fighting spirit.
 He spent fifty years preaching to Han Yu. After Han Jue severed the dream, he didn’t start cultivating immediately. Instead, he looked at Primordial Origin’s coffin outside the netherworld. Primordial Origin’s coffin was still there, and the Primordial Chaos Tablet did not move. However, Han Jue felt the remnant aura of the Sages nearby. It seemed that the Sages had already discovered Primordial Origin some time ago. Han Jue looked at the Heavenly Dao. It was invisible, but the providence of the Heavenly Dao wrapped the Immortal World and the myriad worlds like a huge barrier. He discovered that a line appeared beside this huge barrier. The other end of this providence line entered the darkness and was connected to the distant Earth Immortal World.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du also returned.
 After hesitating for a moment, Han Jue still decided to find Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du.
 He arrived outside the 33rd Heaven and had just appeared in the Universal Hall when the door opened.
 Han Jue arrived in front of Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “You’re here for the mysterious coffin outside the netherworld, right?”
 Han Jue nodded. Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du sighed. “I’ve contacted Master. This coffin has a powerful background. He escaped from the Ancient Desolate. The reason why he came to the Heavenly Dao is to use the Heavenly Dao’s providence to avoid the Inauspicious Evil and Dao Devils.” Han Jue asked in surprise, “The Heavenly Dao can also block the Inauspicious Evil and Dao Devils?”
 Previously, an Inauspicious Deity had infiltrated the Immortal World. If not for the Strange Deity going to devour it, the Immortal World would definitely be in chaos. “That’s right. This is also why the Inauspicious Evil is only in the Dark Forbidden Zone, while the Dao Devils are only in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End. The Heavenly Dao might not be powerful, but its rules are extremely high. Like Giant God Pangu, the Heavenly Dao is definitely the safest place in the Chaos, but it’s also the place with the most shackles. It’s like a prison. You can be safe in it, but you won’t be able to escape it.” Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du nodded.
 Han Jue asked, “If the Inauspicious Evil infiltrates the Heavenly Dao, what does that mean?”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du shook his head. “Impossible!”
 The next second, he seemed to have thought of something and looked terrified.
 Han Jue was already making it clear! Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du stood up and said, “I have to tell Master.”
 Han Jue nodded and left.
 After returning to the Hundred Peak Immortal River, Han Jue felt relaxed.
 It had to be said that it was really good to have Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du around. He could do anything. Han Jue thought of Li Qingzi inexplicably.
 Back then, he had always cultivated in peace. Li Qingzi was always busy with everything in the sect. At most, Li Qingzi would ask him what to do. Sigh. He was really getting old and nostalgic. Han Jue laughed at himself. He continued cultivating. Eight hundred years later.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du sent him a voice transmission, saying that he had something to discuss. Han Jue replied that he had to enter seclusion for a thousand years. He was still two hundred years away. Although Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du was puzzled, he could only agree. After the thousand years were up, Han Jue came to the Universal Hall to see him.
 Han Jue asked, “What is it?”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “I’ve asked. They are Inauspicious Deities. They are existences who have developed intelligence among the Inauspicious Evil. Now, there are mysterious existences among the Inauspicious Deities who have gathered them and might be about to succeed. They can’t affect the Heavenly Dao for the time being. We can be at ease.” “Oh.”
 Han Jue responded. He was very curious about Laozi.
 Laozi seems to be biased towards the Heavenly Dao.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “Be it the Inauspicious Deity or the Chaotic Fiendcelestial’s coffin, we can ignore them. This time, I’ve returned from the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End and brought a prodigy. Fellow Daoist Han, do you want to take him in as your disciple?” “Giving me a disciple of the Human School? Do you want to plant spies?” Han Jue rolled his eyes.
