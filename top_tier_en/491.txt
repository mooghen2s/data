 “From today onwards, other than the disciples of the Hidden Sect, all Connate lifeforms are in-name disciples. In the future, they can become full disciples. The Nether Race will be known as the Hidden Sect’s Nether Zenith. This means that they are the Hidden Sect’s Nether Race’s Zenith Heaven. I hope that you will not let me down. The status of all the clansmen is equivalent to the disciples of the Hidden Sect. The position of the leader, Han You, is equivalent to a second-generation disciple.”
 Han Jue’s voice resounded throughout the entire Dao Field, causing the living beings to be extremely excited.
 They could enter the Hidden Sect now!
 The second-generation disciples were Xun Chang’an, Tu Ling’er, Long Hao, and the others. The first generation was not for disciples, only Han Jue was part of it.
 For a time, the entire Hidden Sect became lively again. Those vague identities also became confirmed.
 Not only were the Connate lifeforms very excited and looking forward to it, but those of the Nether Race were also very happy. Previously, they were always humble when facing the Hidden Sect disciples, mainly because Han Jue didn’t give them a status.
 Now, Han You was equivalent to being Han Jue’s disciple. He could also speak in front of him in the future. The entire Nether Race was also considered as Hidden Sect disciples.
 Hearing the cheers outside, Han Jue couldn’t help but be happy.
 It seemed that he had neglected many things. Sometimes, a decision from him could change many people.
 Han Jue suddenly thought of Han Zuitian.
 Perhaps Han Zuitian could help him manage the internal affairs. Although Murong Qi was also managing it, he could only roughly discuss it with each disciple.
 “Those disciples who have reached a bottleneck can help manage the internal affairs in the future.” Han Jue’s thoughts became clearer.
 As the Hidden Sect became larger and larger, the more disciples there were, the more conflict and trouble there might be. There had to be someone watching. However, when the disciples took in disciples of their own, there should be no need for anyone to especially manage the miscellaneous affairs.
 After thinking, Han Jue closed his eyes and continued cultivating.
 Dao attainment!
 This was what he really cared about!
 Three hundred years later.
 Zhou Fan finally returned, but he was not alone.
 With him were hundreds of thousands of humans.
 Arriving in front of the Dao Field array formation of the Hundred Peak Immortal River, Zhou Fan emitted a powerful aura, forcing the nearby Connate lifeforms to not dare to approach.
 “Master, I’m back!” Zhou Fan shouted.
 Han Jue caught sight of the humans and frowned.
 He couldn’t directly take them in. It would be fine if the number was small, but with so many people, it was almost the entire Human Race. If he took them in, the karma would be too great.
 Moreover, wherever there were people, there would be conflicts!
 Once he accepted them, there would be endless trouble in the future.
 Han Jue’s voice reached Zhou Fan. “Why did you bring so many people?”
 Zhou Fan replied, “Master, don’t worry. I won’t bring them into the Hidden Sect. I’ve already taught them for hundreds of years. I plan to let them stay nearby and make them leave after they become stronger.”
 Han Jue’s eyebrows relaxed.
RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only It seemed that Zhou Fan was not a sanctimonious saint.
 Thinking about it carefully, it made sense. This fellow was not a kind protagonist, to begin with, but the protagonist bearing a deep hatred!
 Han Jue moved him in.
 Zhou Fan quickly came to the Daoist temple. After entering the temple, he recounted his experiences over the years.
 The Human Race had been through many difficulties. Their strength was inferior to Connate lifeforms and ferocious beasts. They were the weakest race in the current Immortal World. Zhou Fan had been injured many times in order to protect them.
 Zhou Fan said, “This Ancient Race thought that they were very powerful, but they were in a state of disunity. All sorts of kings appeared, just like the demons in the past.”
 Han Jue said, “Who cares about them? Cultivate well. Let the powerful members of the Human Race leave. I can allow you to take in a few human disciples, but not the entire Human Race.”
 “Perhaps they are very united and simple now, but when their cultivation and population become stronger, the humans you know will come. You should know what the situation will be then.”
 Zhou Fan nodded. Along the way, the suffering he had endured the most was from the humans.
 The master and disciple chatted for a while before Zhou Fan left.
 That day, the humans settled near the Hundred Peak Immortal River. After the Connate lifeforms were warned by Zhou Fan, they did not dare to find trouble with the humans.
 The appearance of the humans did not affect the Hidden Sect.
 As Zhou Fan recounted his experiences, the disciples knew that they were not the only ones. All the cultivators in the Immortal World were cultivating diligently. While Zhou Fan escorted the humans, he encountered many cave abodes of mighty figures. The powerful aura emitted made even him palpitate.
 After the calamity ended, 90% of the living beings died. However, the remaining 10% were not mediocre. Most of them became Immeasurable Emperors. In addition, without the pressure of competition, they cultivated diligently separately. Their cultivation levels could be said to be constantly increasing.
 The Hidden Sect disciples did not want to be surpassed by others.
 Time passed.
 Year after year passed. A thousand years later.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and stood up to stretch his muscles.
 He scanned with his divine sense and discovered that the human population had already exceeded ten million.
 In just a thousand years, without any danger, the population of the Human Race had increased greatly.
 Not only that, but they also built a city.
 Han Jue showed a frown.
 They didn’t plan to leave!
 This city wasn’t built casually. It was obvious that they had spent a lot of effort. Not only that, but the internal affairs of the Human Race had already been established. There were also various business shops in the city.
 It seemed that someone in the Human Race had memories of the previous calamity. Otherwise, if they were all newcomers, how could they quickly build a true city in the dangerous early-stage Heavenly Dao development?
 Han Jue quickly relaxed his eyebrows.
 Who cared about them? In any case, if Han Jue didn’t activate the Dao Field array formation, the humans wouldn’t be able to enter.
 Boom!
 The ground suddenly shook violently as a terrifying aura erupted from afar, wreaking havoc in the world.
 This aura was even stronger than Ancient Fiendish Yin’s aura!
 Han Jue pinched his fingers to deduce. This aura was on the other side of the Immortal World and was extremely far from the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 Talent truly appeared in every generation.
 This person was venting his pressure like this, clearly wanting to intimidate all living beings.
 Han Jue didn’t care. Although this aura was strong, it was nothing to him.
 Another powerful aura erupted from the other side as if fighting against that person.
 The disciples gathered and began to discuss, curious about who they were.
 Seven years later.
 The Hundred Peak Immortal River welcomed visitors.
 Li Daokong and Li Xuan’ao.
 Han Jue spent four billion years of his lifespan. After confirming that there was no danger, he moved them into the Daoist temple.
 Li Daokong cupped his fists and smiled. “It’s been many years. You seem to have become stronger again.”
 Li Xuan’ao sized him up. For some reason, he felt that Han Jue looked familiar, as if he had seen him somewhere before. It was not in the Heavenly Court, but…
 He couldn’t say.
 Han Jue smiled and asked, “Why are you here? Are you inviting me to join the New Human School again?”
 Li Xuan’ao snorted.
 Li Daokong said, “Do you dare to go against a Sage?”
 “I don’t dare.”
 “You! Then, what did you ask us to join the Hidden Sect?”
 The one who replied was Li Xuan’ao, who was a little exasperated.
 Han Jue didn’t have a good impression of him. “Did you offend a Sage?”.
 Li Daokong said calmly, “That’s right. We broke up with Master and were expelled from the Human School.”
