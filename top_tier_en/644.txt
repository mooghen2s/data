 Of course, he only complained a little. The Heavenly Dao was a rule and did not have the emotions and desires of living beings. Han Jue suddenly thought of something. Undying Dao perished and caused a Great Dao phenomenon. The Chaotic Deity and Cundi who had faked their deaths did not have any Great Dao phenomenon, so why did the mighty figures in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End think that they were dead?
Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m Perhaps those mighty figures did not really think so. They only wanted to put blame on the Dark Forbidden Lord?
 This was the only explanation.
 Han Jue adjusted his state and started to improve his Sword Dao Mystical Powers. Several months later, he continued to cultivate the Grand Unity Aspect. However, just as he began, Ancestor Xitian’s voice entered his ears.
 “All the Sages have come to the Great Ultimate Hall. I have something to say.” Han Jue didn’t move immediately after hearing that.
 Ancestor Xitian was stronger than him!
 Furthermore, he could be active in the Heavenly Dao. Han Jue wasn’t a Heavenly Dao Sage. If he died in the Heavenly Dao, he would really die and not be revived endlessly by the Heavenly Dao. “Does Ancestor Xitian have any intention of killing me?” (170 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?] The value of the ancestor seemed to have increased.
 Continue!
 [Not for the time being.)
 Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief.
 That was good. Han Jue moved out of the Dao Field and arrived outside the 33rd Heaven. The Great Ultimate Hall that had been silent for a long time emitted divine light again, becoming the most dazzling Dao Field outside the 33rd Heaven. Han Jue came to the front of the Great Ultimate Hall. The other Sages were already there. Even Empress Houtu came.
 Li Daokong sighed. “Sect Master, do you still remember how we listened to the Dao together in the Great Ultimate Hall?”
 The Sages had strange expressions. It was fine if he didn’t mention it, but they felt uncomfortable when he did. They wanted to forget Han Jue’s potential! Compared to him, they felt so mediocre, like mortals. Han Jue didn’t answer. Was Li Daokong provoking him?
 Shi Dudao stared at him curiously. He was very curious about the Sect Master of the Hidden Sect. For some reason… he inexplicably felt that Han Jue was like the Dark Forbidden Lord!
 At this moment, the door to the Great Ultimate Hall opened and the Sages entered.
 Ancestor Xitian was sitting on a mat. When the Sages came in front of him, he opened his eyes and waved his right hand. A mat appeared behind each Sage. The Sages meditated. The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate was the first to speak, “Ancestor, you’re finally back. If not for you, the Heavenly Dao would probably be in danger!” The other Sages also flattered him with some sincerity. Previously, when they saw the Flame Race attack the Immortal World, they were all extremely nervous.
 After the Heavenly Dao restarted, the foundation of the Immortal World was still a little lacking. However, there were many living beings but not enough mighty cultivators. Ancestor Xitian sighed. “Before I attacked, misfortune befell Undying Dao. Someone was cursing him.”
 The Sages were stunned. Sect Master Tian Jue narrowed his eyes and said, “Dark Forbidden Lord!”
 Be it the Heavenly Dao or the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End, many people pretended to be the Dark Forbidden Lord and cursed the enemy. However, only the Dark Forbidden Lord’s curse could injure a Great Dao Sage! The Sages began to sigh. “It’s the Dark Forbidden Lord again. In that case, he supports the Heavenly Dao.” “Who is the Dark Forbidden Lord?” “In the past, I felt that it was Fellow Daoist Han Jue. Now, it seems that it shouldn’t be. If Fellow Daoist Han Jue can kill Undying Dao, he would have directly attacked earlier.” “Cough cough, Fellow Daoist Han is here with us. What nonsense are you saying?” “Hahaha.”
 Perhaps because they had experienced many calamities together, the Sages also began to joke about Han Jue as if they were close. Han Jue didn’t answer but snorted in his mind. It’s fine if you want to cause trouble, but don’t joke with me!
 He immediately asked in his mind, “Does Ancestor Xitian have any killing intent towards me?” (170 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?] Continue! [Not for the time being.) Han Jue secretly heaved a sigh of relief. Ancestor Xitian said, “Undying Dao has perished. I previously severely injured him. I didn’t expect the Dark Forbidden Lord to still not let him go. This is also good. The Deity Realm of the Ruins of End probably won’t come to harm the Heavenly Dao for the time being. “I have something to announce. I will leave the Heavenly Dao.” With that said, the Sages widened their eyes in shock. They urged him to stay.
 Ancestor Xitian was their greatest backing. If he left, the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End would definitely become even more rampant.
 Although Li Daokong, Shi Dudao, and Fang Liang did not say a word, they didn’t want Ancestor Xitian to leave either.
 Before they attained the Dao, they knew that the one who truly protected the Heavenly Dao was not a Sage, but Ancestor Xitian, the Dao Ancestor’s close friend!
 Ancestor Xitian continued, “I’ve discussed with the Great Dao Sages in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End and decided to go together to suppress the Ancient Desolate. In the next period of time, the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End should not disturb the Heavenly Dao, but you can’t let your guard down. There are many races like the Flame Race hidden in the chaos. Some of them were expelled by the Heavenly Dao, and some were born from the creation of mighty figures. In the long years, they have already risen. “Because of the existence of the Immeasurable Calamity, the Heavenly Dao’s strength has always been restricted. Instead, it has fallen behind the Chaos. I don’t know why the Dao Ancestor set the rules like this, nor can I guess.”
 Hearing this, the Sages did not feel good. To be honest, the invasion of the Flame Race had deeply stimulated them. They even blamed the Dao Ancestor.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du asked, “What is hidden in the Ancient Desolate that actually requires the Great Dao Sages to join forces?” Ancestor Xitian said, “Pangu’s killing intent.” The Sages were stunned. “Pangu split the world apart and his body transformed into all things, but his killing intent was not recorded in the legends. Back then, Pangu slaughtered three thousand Chaotic Fiendcelestials to attain the Dao. His killing intent even began to bewitch his Dao heart. He had no choice but to extract his killing intent and suppress it in the Heavenly Dao. As time passed, more and more Chaotic Fiendcelestials appeared again and resonated with Pangu’s killing intent. After undergoing Dao Integration, the Dao Ancestor had no choice but to suppress Pangu’s killing intent in the Ancient Desolate.
 “Once this killing intent appears, it will definitely reproduce the scene of blood cleansing the chaos.” Ancestor Xitian sighed and the Sages fell silent. Han Jue was deep in thought. Could that supreme power be Pangu’s killing intent?
 But after so many years, could Pangu’s killing intent still continue to become stronger? Logically speaking, if Pangu had died, the Chaotic Fiendcelestial that had survived for so long would have long surpassed him.
 Wait.
 Could Pangu be alive?
 Han Jue’s heart tightened. He felt that it was very possible. Under normal circumstances, who was willing to sacrifice themselves to create a new world?
 Anyway, Han Jue didn’t want to. After the Heavenly Dao was established, the mighty figures of the later generations also proved one thing. Creating a world did not necessarily mean sacrificing oneself. For example, Li Muyi and Ancestor Xitian had both created their own Little Heavenly Dao.
 Ancestor Xitian suddenly looked at Han Jue and said, “Han Jue, which Chaotic Fiendcelestial are you?”
 The Sages also looked at him.
 Han Jue said, “Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial.”
 In any case, the Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial had already been born.
 Ancestor Xitian frowned. The Sages were balanced. Since Han Jue was really a Chaotic Fiendcelestial, it was normal that they couldn’t compare. “I know the Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial. He’s still alive. Why is it you?” Ancestor Xitian asked again.
