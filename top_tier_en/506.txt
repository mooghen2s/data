 As long as I don’t go out, it’s useless even if all living beings come!
 Great!
 Since you dare to fall out with me, don’t blame me for being impolite!
 Han Jue thought to himself and decided to use the Book of Misfortune to punish Sect Master Tian Jue in the future.
 He had to at least go mad even if he wasn’t cursed to death!
 At the same time.
 All the living beings in the Hundred Peak Immortal River were discussing this matter. They did not panic, but they were puzzled as to why Sect Master Tian Jue was slandering them.
 Han Jue cultivated diligently every day. Why would he steal the Primordial Purple Qi?
 They all felt that the Sages were deliberately making things difficult for the Hidden Sect.
 After listening to the Dao for so many years, the disciples of the Hidden Sect trusted Han Jue. He wouldn’t panic even if the sky collapsed. They wouldn’t panic.
 Because Han Jue didn’t say anything, the disciples didn’t look for him rashly.
 The Hidden Sect did not seem to hear this. They discussed for a while before continuing to cultivate.
 Xuan Qingjun came to find him. She wasn’t stupid and knew that she had been used by a Sage.
 Han Jue comforted her and promised that nothing would happen to the Hundred Peak Immortal River. She could only be relieved.
 Another thousand years passed.
 Transformed living beings often wandered around the Hundred Peak Immortal River, but no one had dared to barge in for the past thousand years.
 The Hidden Sect was famous for its ferociousness. In addition to Li Daokong’s strength, even with the Sage’s orders, all living beings did not dare to forcefully provoke the Hidden Sect.
 As for the Primordial Purple Qi, it was too far away for most living beings. It was so far away that they weren’t sure if it was true.
 In the past thousand years, people from the Hidden Sect had stepped into the Deity Realm one after another, including Murong Qi, Chu Shiren, Han You, and the others.
 As the leader of the Nether Race, Han You’s potential was naturally the strongest.
 This meant that the Nether Race was about to enter the Deity Realm on a large scale.
 Ten thousand Deity Realm existences. Since ancient times, even the Jie School, which had ten thousand immortals, might not be so powerful.
 Han Jue was even more satisfied. It was indeed wise to accept the Nether Race.
 Boom!
 The mountains in the Hundred Peak Immortal River shook. A terrifying aura erupted, enveloping the world.
 The disciples did not panic because they knew that the other disciples were breaking through
 Zhao Xuanyuan!
 He had reached the Zenith Heaven Realm!
 The Hidden Sect had another Zenith Heaven!
 For a time, there was endless joy in the Hundred Peak Immortal River. With one more Zenith Heaven, the stronger the Hidden Sect was, the safer they would be. Every disciple was very happy.
 Especially to the in-name disciples. The Hidden Sect had hundreds of thousands of in-name disciples. Only a small number of them were taken in as disciples by the orthodox disciples. Although they were all in the Hundred Peak Immortal River, they were actually in two different worlds. The in-name disciples yearned to become true disciples of the Hidden Sect.
 After Zhao Xuanyuan became a Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal, he began to crazily challenge Li Xuan’ao and Dao Sovereign in the simulation trial.
 In the previous hundred-year competition, he had been suppressed by the two of them. As for Li Daokong, he was a Pseudo-Sage, so there was no need for him to participate.
 While the Hidden Sect’s inner circle was active, the Sages were very unhappy.
 Outside the 33rd Heaven, Sage Dao Field.
 Li Muyi, the South Extreme Heavenly Venerate, Sage Jin’an, and Sect Master Tian Jue gathered here.
 “Mortals are afraid of the Hidden Sect. What should we do?” the South Extreme Heavenly Venerate asked worriedly.
 Sect Master Tian Jue frowned. He was the one who had given the order to destroy the Hidden Sect. Now that all living beings did not listen, he was the most embarrassed.
 Sage Jin’an shook his head. “To be honest, why do you insist on provoking him? This child’s temperament is like a turtle. He hides somewhere and never goes out. Now, the Immortal World is his best shelter. If he doesn’t leave the Immortal World, we can’t do anything to him. Our disciples can’t break through his Dao Field array formation, either. We can only shoot ourselves in the foot.”
 Sect Master Tian Jue snorted unhappily.
 The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate mocked. “Then, why didn’t you say so before?”
 Sage Jin’an rolled his eyes. “Can I persuade
 you?”
 Li Muyi said, “Alright, something has happened. In that case, I’ll send the Three Pure Sacred Ancestor to break through the Hidden Sect’s array formation. Gather your disciples and wait in the Hundred Peak Immortal River.”
 The three Sages’ eyes lit up.
 They were waiting for this sentence!
 Sage Jin’an smiled. “The Three Pure Sacred Ancestor has already gotten rid of Shi Dudao?”
 Li Muyi said, “How can Shi Dudao be a match for the Three Pure Sacred Ancestor?”
 Sect Master Tian Jue stood up and said, “That’s all. I hope that you won’t disappoint
 us.”
 His tone was mocking.
 This was all caused by Li Muyi!
 If he didn’t scheme against Han Jue, how could he have lost the Primordial Purple Qi?
 It was strange.
 Sages plotted against Han Jue, but he always had a way to break through. This was the first time they encountered such a situation.
 Mortals were like ants on a sand table. Sages looked down on them and could see their path from above. Whatever they used could block their path. The ants were tiny and were on the sand table again. From its point of view, it couldn’t see the people standing outside the sand table. Every time it encountered something that blocked its way, it could only bypass it. Now, the Sages had dug a pit behind the small slope in front of the ant. Logically speaking, the ants could not see it at all, but the ant had already gone around before it even went up the slope. It was really strange. Han Jue was that ant!
 The Sages were puzzled.
 No matter how they schemed against him, he could always avoid them and even make them suffer.
 It didn’t make sense!
 Another seven hundred years passed.
 There were more and more in-name disciples in the Hundred Peak Immortal River. It wasn’t that Han Jue had expanded again, but that those in-name disciples had begun to reproduce.
 This matter was arranged by Han Zuitian. Ever since he was threatened by Sect Master Tian Jue, he felt that there was a risk in recruiting disciples outside. It was better to create more himself. In any case, the Hundred Peak Immortal River was big enough and could contain many living beings.
 Han Jue turned a blind eye to this.
 The Hidden Sect needed its own development system. It was indispensable for generations to pass.
 One day, Li Daokong suddenly came to visit him.
 Han Jue let him enter the Daoist temple.
 “Sect Master, the Heavenly Dao’s providence has been changing recently. I’m afraid it’s not good,” Li Daokong said in a low voice.
 Han Jue remembered that he had once stepped into the Heavenly Dao directly. Perhaps he really had a way to observe its providence.
 “What’s wrong?”
 “I suspect that a Sage wants to conceal the heavenly secrets and obtain the short period of time to enter the Immortal World for himself. To a Sage, no matter how short the time is, it’s enough to kill the enemy he wants to kill.”
 Li Daokong’s expression was very ugly. He meant that the Sages wanted to personally deal with the Hidden Sect.
 Shocked, Han Jue asked cautiously, “Can the current Heavenly Dao Sage break through the array formation of the Dao Field?”
 (4 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎 Continue!
 [Not for the time being.)
 “What if all the Sages attack together?”
 (Yes, but it needs time. The Immortal World can’t withstand the Dharmic powers of more than four Sages.]
 In other words, he was still safe.
 Han Jue cursed silently. Were these Sages crazy?
 Li Daokong asked, “Sect Master, what should we do?”
 Han Jue said calmly, “Cultivate in peace. I’ll deal with the Sages.”
 Li Daokong was stunned.
 Although he knew that Han Jue was stronger than the Heavenly Dao Sage, his confident tone convinced him.
 Such a powerful existence did not fight or hold ambition. How bold and magnanimous was this?
