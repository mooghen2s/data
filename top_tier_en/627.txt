 Han Jue came in front of him and asked, “You still acknowledge me?”
 Fang Liang said, “I’ll acknowledge you forever. If not for you, I wouldn’t be here today. In Fang Liang’s heart, Grandmaster’s kindness is the greatest.”
 Han Jue asked, “Then, can you tell me why you want to rope in other Sages?”
 Fang Liang was silent.
 Han Jue said, “The battle of the Sages has nothing to do with me. However, if it affects the Heavenly Dao, I will also help. I want to cultivate in peace. The Heavenly Dao can protect me from being disturbed.”
 Fang Liang sighed. “What I’m doing is precisely to support the Heavenly Dao. Grandmaster, you should already know. These Sages are actually puppets with the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End controlling them. If we can’t sever karma, the Heavenly Dao will always be the puppets of the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End.
 “I want the Heavenly Dao to escape its shackles. This is also the Dao Ancestor’s will.”
 With that said, Fang Liang’s eyes became firm.
 He had changed after becoming the Heavenly Emperor. The reason why he changed was that he had no choice.
 He felt the same as the previous Heavenly Emperor. Even if he stood at the peak of the immortals, he was still a puppet in the hands of the Sages.
 Many times, they wanted to do something for the Heavenly Dao, but when it involved their benefits, they had no choice but to give up. This feeling was of extreme grievance.
 Han Jue asked, “The Dao Ancestor is already dead?”
 If not for his death, how could he be called a will?
 “Yes, the reason why the Dao Ancestor disappeared was to destroy an extremely terrifying existence. That terrifying existence wanted to devour the Heavenly Dao and the Great Dao. After the will left behind by the Dao Ancestor chose me, it told me that the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End has already been infiltrated by that terrifying existence. If the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End devours the Heavenly Dao and releases the countless terrifying things imprisoned in the Ancient Desolate, the next to suffer will be the Chaos,” Fang Liang said in a low voice.
𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com “I also wanted to tell this to the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End, but I almost died in the Dark Forbidden Zone. After that, I understood that the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End is unreliable. If I want to save the Heavenly Dao, I have to rely on my own efforts!
 “Grandmaster, I know that you only want to cultivate in peace. I don’t want to drag you into the problem, but please don’t stop me. I’m already determined to dedicate myself to the Dao and risk my life for it.”
 Fang Liang’s tone was determined and no longer as indifferent as before.
 Han Jue silently used the derivation function and consumed 4 billion years of his lifespan to see that Fang Liang was not lying.
 From the looks of it, he really cared about the Heavenly Dao.
 Perhaps this was also the reason why the Heavenly Dao chose him.
 Han Jue said, “I hope you can do what you say. What do you think about the Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage?”
 The Dao Ancestor was not dead, but he told Fang Liang that he wasn’t. Han Jue felt that things might not be that simple.
 However, he couldn’t say it clearly. The current Dao Ancestor was an existence he couldn’t provoke. Even if he said it, Fang Liang wouldn’t believe him. Fang Liang was determined to stir up trouble himself.
 Fang Liang said, “We have to suppress him. He’s the saber arranged by the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End, and he won’t be the last. After the Heavenly Dao restarted, the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End has already planted three blades in the Heavenly Dao. It’s ridiculous. They didn’t choose from all living beings but sent them from the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End. Their intentions are already clear. Perhaps in their opinion, the current Heavenly Dao is nothing to fear. There’s no need to hide it. After all, the Dao Ancestor is already gone.”
 Han Jue was relieved after understanding Fang Liang’s thoughts.
 He was afraid that this fellow would collude with the Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage.
 The two of them chatted for a while more. When Han Jue left, Fang Liang personally sent him to the entrance of the hall.
 After returning to the Hundred Peak Immortal River, Han Jue sat on the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus. The first thing he did was enter the simulation trial and fight the Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage.
 An hour later.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and frowned. He couldn’t kill him!
 The Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage was not his match, but in the Heavenly Dao, the immense providence of the Heavenly Dao supported him. If Han Jue killed him ten thousand times, he would revive ten thousand times.
 It was a little difficult to deal with.
 If Han Jue became enemies with the Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage, he could only trick him out of the Heavenly Dao.
 However, if he did so, he might be killed by the mighty figures in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End.
 Han Jue began to try to subdue the Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage, but he was too powerful and difficult to suppress. If Han Jue used too much strength, he would kill him and start the revival loop.
 No, he had to think of a way to become stronger and capture the Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage in the future.
 The Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage was truly too powerful. Even if the other Sages joined forces, they weren’t his match. Han Jue couldn’t allow such an existence to control the providence of the Heavenly Dao alone.
 Han Jue suddenly thought of the Great Dao fragment.
 When he gathered another nine Great Dao fragments, he could create a Great Dao Mystical Power that was especially used to suppress enemies.
 He currently had six Great Dao fragments and only had three left.
 As his cultivation level increased, the difficulty of triggering the system’s choice also increased.
 The Mystical Powers he had created with the Great Dao fragment were the Primordial Chaos Reincarnation Great Dao, the Great Dao of Extreme Origin, the Dark Nightmare, and the Primordial Divine Rage. They were all impressive opportunities.
 After confirming his target, Han Jue continued cultivating
 …
 More than two thousand years later, Han Jue passed the 140,000th year but still didn’t trigger the system’s choice. It was probably only triggered once every hundred thousand years.
 On this day.
 An uninvited guest arrived outside the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 ‘”I am Great Loose Heaven, and I have specially come to acknowledge the master of the Hidden?Sect!”
 Great Loose Heaven’s voice entered the Hundred Peak Immortal River, causing the disciples to be in an uproar.
 They were very familiar with the name Great Loose Heaven. If they closed their eyes and looked at the Heavenly Dao Providence Board, they would see this name there. It was still in the top position.
 After Li Daokong, Shi Dudao, and Fang Liang successfully attained the Dao, their names disappeared. They couldn’t encounter any opponents for the time being.
 Of course, the more important reason was that the Heavenly Dao Providence Board was already useless. All living beings did not care about it at all.
 Under the Fusang Tree, Xun Chang’an asked curiously, “Why did he come to seek refuge with us?”
 Chu Shiren said, “Needless to say, he was played by a Sage and had no choice. With his current status and cultivation, if he can’t become a Sage, why would he fight for providence? How can anyone in the Immortal World kill him?”
 As the Supreme Buddha in his previous life, Chu Shiren knew too well.
 With a word from a Sage, all living beings would fight even if they had to risk their lives.
 However, Sages were not omnipotent!
 Han Jue didn’t reply.
 Great Loose Heaven knelt in front of the Hundred Peak Immortal River, looking determined to stay.
 The living beings witnessed this scene. News spread throughout the Immortal World in the following decades and shocked all living beings.
 The Hidden Sect squeezed into the eyes of all living beings again!
 Outside the 33rd Heaven.
 In the Universal Hall. The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate teased. “This Great Loose Heaven is really shameless, but it’s useless. If you want to become a Sage, you can’t just submit to anyone unless it’s the Dao Ancestor.”
 Sect Master Tian Jue nodded.
 They also felt bad about Great Loose Heaven, but they had no choice. They wanted to compensate him, but he didn’t accept it and instead angered them.
 In the eyes of the Sages, Great Loose Heaven thought too highly of himself.
 If he didn’t become a Sage, he would only be an ant floating in the mortal world. How many calamities could he survive?
 Without the help of a Sage, the Immeasurable Calamity could obliterate him!
