 The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate, Sect Master Tian Jue, Fuxitian, and Emperor Xiao were extremely nervous.
 Qiu Xilai’s miserable state gave them immense pressure.
 They attacked one after another. Boundless Dharmic powers transformed into four torrents that collided with the huge black hole in the distance, but they did not cause any damage.
Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m The Dao Heavenly Devil tore at the black hole and quickly widened it.
 His sinister and terrifying head stretched out with a greedy expression. His long tongue stretched out from his mouth and stirred the Chaotic Qi of the 33rd Heaven.
 Sect Master Tian Jue slashed out with his sword. An extremely dazzling sword Qi attacked and almost instantly collided with the Dao Heavenly Devil’s head.
 The Dao Heavenly Devil suddenly took a deep breath and sucked the sword Qi into his stomach.
 Immediately after, the Dao Heavenly Devil crawled out as if he had gone mad. A terrifying roar resounded in the 33rd Heaven. All the living beings in the Immortal World could vaguely hear it.
 Inside the Daoist temple.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and looked up. He saw the Dao Heavenly Devil enter the 33rd Heaven and fight with the Sages. The Sages weren’t the Dao Heavenly Devil’s match at all. They were completely suppressed. Endless Heavenly Devils surged out from the black hole behind the Dao Heavenly Devil. They were ferocious and terrifying.
 Again?
 Han Jue raised his eyebrows but didn’t attack immediately. It was a good opportunity to kill with a borrowed knife.
 The Sages had always been plotting against him. He could use this opportunity to suppress them. However, he didn’t want them to die. At the very least, he wanted them to be severely injured so that he could rest in peace for many years to come.
 Han Jue continued the simulation trial and looked for a strategy.
 Every time he ended a trial, he would look up at the battle situation. Sages were Sages, after all. Even if they couldn’t win, they wouldn’t die so easily.
 Furthermore, in the area of the Heavenly Dao, even if their bodies were destroyed, the Heavenly Dao would revive them.
 It repeated the cycle.
 Half a year passed.
 Han Jue ended the simulation trial again. The time needed to kill the five Dao Heavenly Devils decreased to five minutes. This was already the limit.
 He looked up again and discovered that Empress Houtu had actually gone to help.
 If it was any other Sage, Han Jue could leave them in the lurch. However, Empress Houtu was on good terms with him, and Reincarnation needed her. Han Jue couldn’t let her die.
 Han Jue stood up and stretched. “I’ll hide and ambush them later.”
 Han Jue thought silently. In the simulation trial, the opponents set up would directly attack the challenger. He had no chance to ambush them.
 In reality, if the sneak attack succeeded, the time it took to kill the Dao Heavenly Devil might be even shorter.
 After stretching, Han Jue jumped out of the Dao Field nervously and came to the 33rd Heaven.
 He turned invisible and hid in the darkness.
 The Dao Heavenly Devil was surrounded by the Sages, and countless Heavenly Devils floated outside the battle area. These Heavenly Devils couldn’t touch the Sages at all. Even if they were destroyed, they would still advance one after another.
 The battlefield covered a radius of billions of kilometers. The Heavenly Devils were everywhere. Han Jue still had to find the direction.
 He quietly circled behind the Dao Heavenly Devil.
 The Heavenly Devils could be revived. Han Jue had to use the Void Fiendcelestial and the Devour Fiendcelestial’s power to eliminate them.
 The Void Fiendcelestial turned the Heavenly Devils into nothingness and the Devour Fiendcelestial devoured them directly. Both could directly eliminate the Heavenly Devils.
 The Dao Heavenly Devil was stronger than ordinary Heavenly Devils. Even if Han Jue combined these two powers, he couldn’t insta-kill him. However, as long as he could suppress him, he could exhaust the Dao Heavenly Devil to death.
 The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate was killed by Dao Heavenly Devil again. His Sage Soul quickly escaped. A pillar of light descended from the sky and shone on his Sage Soul. Immediately after, it reformed his body.
 The other Sages continued to fight. Even Qiu Xilai was fighting
 Empress Houtu was located behind the Sages, waving her long staff. Seven-colored light scattered down and guided the providence of the Heavenly Dao into the Sages.
 This was…
 Support?
 Han Jue cursed silently when he saw this scene.
 Then, he transformed into a Heavenly Devil and quietly approached the Dao Heavenly Devil.
 He used the power of the Hidden Fiendcelestial as if he was a true Heavenly Devil. The other Heavenly Devils couldn’t sense at all.
 “No! We can’t block it!”
 Emperor Xiao sent a voice transmission. The Sages had established a Sage Sense voice transmission that allowed them to communicate easily without opening their mouths.
 Sect Master Tian Jue gritted his teeth and sent a voice transmission, “We have to! We have no way to retreat! We have no choice!”
 Qiu Xilai’s eyes were also extremely determined. At this moment, he had already forgotten his fear.
 He would still die even if he left the Heavenly Dao!
 They could only fight!
 Empress Houtu looked at Dao Heavenly Devil’s terrifying and mighty body with fear.
 SU
 The terror of the Dao Heavenly Devil was something that could be sensed with the naked eye. In the 33rd Heaven, his height was immeasurable, as if all living beings were extremely tiny in front of him.
 The Sages tried their best to fight, but their hearts were filled with despair.
 Their only hope now was Ancestor Xitian!
 They hoped that Ancestor Xitian would return in time!
 However, every time Ancestor Xitian went out to discuss the Dao, it would take at least a million years for him to return. How many years had it been since he left?
 They could only hope that Ancestor Xitian could sense the Heavenly Dao’s danger.
 “Are you afraid? Is this the power of the Heavenly Dao Sages? “Among the grudges I absorbed, many ghosts are filled with reverence for Sages. If they knew that Sages were so humble, what would they think?”
 The Dao Heavenly Devil laughed wildly, his tone filled with killing intent.
 The Sages fought in silence.
 At this moment…
 The Dao Heavenly Devil suddenly sensed something and turned around.
 Han Jue was already ten thousand kilometers away from him.
 Ten thousand kilometers was extremely far for mortals, but to them, it was already an extremely dangerous distance.
 The moment the Dao Heavenly Devil turned his head, Han Jue suddenly revealed his true form. His Supreme Treasures were activated and emitted a dazzling divine light. Two Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols suddenly emerged from Han Jue’s body and pounced on the Dao Heavenly Devil.
 Void Fiendcelestial!
 Devour Fiendcelestial!
 They were black shadows.
 The Void Fiendcelestial wrapped around the Dao Heavenly Devil as quickly as possible. The Devour Fiendcelestial pounced on the Dao Heavenly Devil and bit off its huge head.
 Han Jue shook his arms, and the remaining 72 Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols erupted at the same time. In an instant, the void was occupied by the 72 majestic and terrifying figures.
 The 72 Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols surrounded the Dao Heavenly Devil and attacked!
 The Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial punched out angrily. The wind from his fist swept through the ten million Heavenly Devils and pierced through their abdomens.
 Shadow Flood Fiendcelestial transformed into countless fiendcelestial shadows that attacked the Heavenly Devils in all directions.
 The Extreme Ice Fiendcelestial struck out with his palm, causing the power of extreme ice to freeze the Chaotic Space. Even the Sage Dao Field was frozen.
 The Qi Fiendcelestial dispersed the Chaotic Qi, leaving only the Dao Heavenly Devil and the Fiendcelestial Dharma Idol in the Fiendcelestial Battlefield.
 The other Dharma Idols used their Great Dao to destroy the Dao Heavenly Devil.
 The Dao Heavenly Devil was suppressed until he couldn’t fight back.
 The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate, Sect Master Tian Jue, Emperor Xiao, Qiu Xilai, and Empress Houtu were all dumbfounded and speechless.
 “Erm…”
 Qiu Xilai trembled in disbelief. He couldn’t accept what was happening.
 He knew that Han Jue was very strong, but he didn’t expect him to be so strong!
 The lawless Dao Heavenly Devil was directly pressed down by him and couldn’t move. He endured Han Jue’s torture!
 Impossible!
 Didn’t he just attain the Dao?
 Why was he so strong?
