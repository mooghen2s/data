 With the help of the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus, Han Jue was no longer ravaged by the curse.
 He pinched his fingers to deduce, but he couldn’t deduce the source of this curse.
nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎 Looks like they’re also afraid of being discovered. They’re all imitating me. Han Jue thought disdainfully to himself, “You can curse anyone but me!”
 “I want to know who cursed me!”
 (100 million years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?] Continue!
 He had consumed a lot of his lifespan recently, but it was still far from hitting a round number. Han Jue was not afraid of spending it.
 Immediately after, Han Jue felt dizzy and realized that he had jumped into another scene.
 He opened his eyes and discovered that he had arrived in an underground cave. A figure was cursing someone with a book in front of him.
 It was Xue Minghe.
 Han Jue was very familiar with this guy. After all, this fellow had led many ancient races to create the Darkness Sect.
 Bastard!
 You even dare to curse your ancestor. If you don’t die, who will?
 Han Jue was furious.
 At this moment, he suddenly heard Xue Minghe muttering, “Dark Forbidden Lord, do you feel it? I hope you’ll like this!”
 What did he mean?
 Han Jue was surprised. The reason why Xue Minghe cursed him was to attract his attention?
 Wait!
 How did Xue Minghe know that he was the Dark Forbidden Lord?
 The Demon Emperor, Zu Tu, the Heavenly Dao Buddha, and the other mighty figures did not know. How could he?
 The scene shattered and Han Jue returned to the Connate Cave Abode.
 He continued to ask, “Does Xue Minghe know that I’m the Dark Forbidden Lord?”
 [No]
 This time, the system did not deduct his lifespan.
 Han Jue couldn’t help but ponder. Why?
 Could it be that it involved his current karma and would not deduct his lifespan?
 That didn’t seem right.
 Could it be the after-sales service?
 Han Jue couldn’t figure it out and couldn’t be bothered to think about it anymore. He started to think about Xue Minghe.
 Before long, the curse vanished.
 It was obvious that Xue Minghe was not targeting him. But why was he cursed?
 Han Jue couldn’t help but think of the forces related to him. Could it be that Xue Minghe was cursing the Heavenly Court or the Nether Race?
 Han Jue continued to ask in his heart, “Why did Xue Minghe curse me?”
 (50 million years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 (He is cursing the Heavenly Court.]
 Indeed.
 Han Jue immediately took out the Book of Misfortune and started cursing Xue Minghe.
 Although Xue Minghe was very likely his fan, he threatened the Heavenly Court. Han Jue had to take action.
 Han Jue prepared to spend a billion years to warn Xue Minghe.
 Several days later.
 In the catacombs.
 Boom!
 The terrifying aura shook the cave. Xue Minghe was meditating and circulating his energy with an extremely pale face.
 He was being cursed!
 “It’s definitely the Dark Forbidden Lord!”
 Xue Minghe shivered. This was the first time he had felt such a powerful curse. Only such a curse could drive the Demon Emperor and the Heavenly Dao Buddha mad.
 Therefore, it could only be the Dark Forbidden Lord!
 Not only was Xue Minghe not afraid, but he was also very excited.
 The Dark Forbidden Lord finally responded!
 With the Dark Forbidden Lord’s strength, he could definitely curse him to death easily. However, he did not, which meant that he was transmitting information.
 The Dark Forbidden Lord was hiding in the Heavenly Court?
 It was possible!
 No wonder nothing happened to the Heavenly Court among the four overlords.
 The Demon Court was about to collapse, the Buddhist Sect had lost a Buddha, and the Divine Palace had changed owners. Only the Heavenly Court had obtained the help of the Dao Sect.
 No matter how he looked at it, the Heavenly Court was protected by the Dark Forbidden Lord!
 As Xue Minghe was thinking, an even stronger curse surged over.
 Oh no!
 He couldn’t withstand it!
 Xue Minghe spat out a mouthful of blood and formed hand seals with both hands to stabilize the Dharmic powers in his body. Fortunately, the curse did not continue to strengthen. It dissipated after five minutes.
 Although Xue Minghe had suffered internal injuries, it was not serious.
 He didn’t hate the Dark Forbidden Lord. Instead, he was happy.
 The Dark Forbidden Lord did not kill him because he wanted to accept him! Xue Minghe put himself in his shoes. If he was the Dark Forbidden Lord, he wouldn’t hold back if he wanted to kill someone.
 With these thoughts in mind, he felt even more respect for the Dark Forbidden Lord. “From now on, the Heavenly Court cannot be targeted. I have to ally with them to show my good intentions.” Xue Minghe wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and revealed a sinister smile.
 He felt that he was too smart! This way, he could confirm where the Dark Forbidden Lord was.
 “Zu Tu, you pretended to be the Dark Forbidden Lord. Just wait for your death. I can’t defeat you, but the Dark Forbidden Lord will definitely not let you go!”
 Xue Minghe began to look forward to the outcome.
 After teaching Xue Minghe a lesson, Han Jue continued cultivating.
 Time passed.
 Ten years later.
 Han Jue’s cultivation level increased again. He stopped cultivating and took out the Heavenly Dao Token to contact the Heavenly Emperor.
 Soon, the Heavenly Emperor connected to his divine sense.
 Han Jue asked, “Your Majesty, have you found Hao’er?”
 The Heavenly Emperor said with a solemn tone, “I’ve found him, but I can’t bring him back. Next, if he looks for you, you can pretend that you had never accepted him as your disciple.” “What do you mean? Did he betray us? Or was he possessed?”
 “I can’t say. He wasn’t possessed, but he’s in danger now. Believe me.”
 Between Long Hao and the Heavenly Emperor, Han Jue definitely trusted the Heavenly Emperor more.
 The Heavenly Emperor was someone who treated him well, and Long Hao was definitely someone who Han Jue treated well.
 Han Jue said, “I understand. How’s the Heavenly Court recently?”
 The Heavenly Emperor said, “Not bad. We’re constantly devouring the territory of the Demon Court and have also obtained the allegiance of many forces, including the most prominent Darkness Sect. They took the initiative to express their goodwill and formed an alliance with the Heavenly Court. It’s probably the Dark Forbidden Lord’s intention.”
 Han Jue thought to himself, “Xue Minghe is quite perceptive!”
 In that case, he did not have to die.
 Han Jue said seriously, “Your Majesty, the Dark Forbidden Lord is mysterious and unfathomable. You have to be careful not to be used.”
 “Don’t worry, I know what to do. As long as they don’t go against the Heavenly Court, everything can be discussed.”
 The two of them continued to chat for a while before severing their divine sense connection.
 Heavenly Court!
 In the Imperial Garden.
 The Heavenly Emperor put down the Heavenly Dao Token and muttered, “Is he really unrelated to the Dark Forbidden Lord?”
 Xue Minghe said that it was the Dark Forbidden Lord’s intention to cooperate with the Heavenly Court. If that was true, the Dark Forbidden Lord should be from the Heavenly Court.
 He couldn’t help but suspect Han Jue again.
 However, Han Jue told him to be careful of the Dark Forbidden Lord.
 It didn’t make sense.
 “What am I thinking? His talent is already strong enough, why would I still expect him to rely on his own methods to help the Heavenly Court?”
 The Heavenly Emperor shook his head and laughed, feeling that he had too many fantasies about Han Jue.
 He frowned. Since the Dark Forbidden Lord had nothing to do with Han Jue, it was very likely that he would harm the Heavenly Court.
 Why did the Darkness Sect take this step?
 In the Immortal World now, the Heavenly Court was already the strongest force. Under such circumstances, the Darkness Sect helping the Heavenly Court would only help them successfully win the calamity.
 If the Heavenly Court won, what could the Dark Forbidden Lord obtain?
 A conspiracy!
 The more the Heavenly Emperor thought about it, the more uneasy he became. After all, the calamity had yet to reach its peak. Perhaps the Heavenly Court’s calamity had yet to truly arrive.
