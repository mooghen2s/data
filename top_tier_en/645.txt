 However, on second thought, something was wrong. He had already created the Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial. If there was another Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial, the two Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestials should be able to sense each other. After all, they were both of the same Great Dao.
 This old dog is tricking me? Han Jue asked in his mind, “Is Ancestor Xitian tricking me?” (170 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 (Yes]
 Han Jue secretly heaved a sigh of relief. He was very dissatisfied with Ancestor Xitian. Why are you tricking me for no reason? Trying to mess with me? I think you’re asking for a curse! Seeing that Han Jue didn’t answer, Ancestor Xitian continued to ask, “What? Do you have something you can’t say?” Han Jue pretended to be bitter and said, “I don’t understand what you mean, Ancestor. I’m the Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial. The Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial is me. There can’t be two Chaotic Fiendcelestials that are the same. What do you want to say to me, Ancestor? I don’t understand how I offended you. I can be said to be diligent in dealing with the Heavenly Dao. I interfere every time the Heavenly Dao is in trouble. I don’t usually rely on the Heavenly Dao to cultivate. I have a clear conscience towards the Heavenly Dao. If the Heavenly Dao doesn’t tolerate me, I’ll leave!”
 He immediately stood up.
 The other Sages dissuaded him. “Fellow Daoist Han, what are you doing?” “Ancestor doesn’t mean that. He’s just puzzled.” “Ancestor, Han Jue really sacrificed a lot for the Heavenly Dao. During the time you left, if not for him, we would have long collapsed.” “Yes, so what if Han Jue is not the Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial? In any case, he belongs to the Heavenly Dao.”
 “Sect Master, if you want to leave, I’ll leave too!”
 The Sages took Han Jue’s side. The reason was that Ancestor Xitian was about to leave. They could still rely on Han Jue. Ancestor Xitian said helplessly, “I’m just asking. I don’t really know the Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial. Why are you angry, Young Friend Han Jue?”
 Han Jue sat down angrily and sighed. “I don’t know why. I’ve always been cultivating in seclusion, but there are always people coming to find trouble with me or question my identity. It might be related to the variable that the Dao Ancestor said. The Dao Ancestor’s words have screwed me over. In the past, not only did the Heavenly Dao Sages try to rope me in, but even the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End’s Dijun, Empress Nüwa.”
 The eyes of the Sages flickered. They also remembered the variable that the Dao Ancestor had mentioned, but they didn’t expect the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End to have also tried to rope Han Jue in.
 Ancestor Xitian was expressionless, but he was also dissatisfied with Dijun.
 Hmph!
 He didn’t expect Dijun to scheme behind his back.
 Ancestor Xitian said, “Since you are the Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial, I will entrust the Heavenly Dao to you. Only you are a Freedom Sage. I hope that you can protect the Heavenly Dao. If I can return alive, I will give you a huge opportunity!” Han Jue neither agreed nor disagreed. Why was he tricking him for no reason? To put it bluntly, he didn’t trust him! He couldn’t take Ancestor Xitian’s opportunity! Heavenly Venerate Wufa couldn’t help but ask, “Senior, your cultivation is so high. Are you really going to offer yourself to the Ancient Desolate?” In his opinion, even if Pangu’s killing intent broke out, Ancestor Xitian could still hide.
 Back when Pangu attained the Dao, some Chaotic Fiendcelestials had survived.
 Ancestor Xitian glanced at him and said, “Destroying Pangu’s killing intent is not only to protect the Heavenly Dao and the Chaos but also to attain the Dao. Whoever can defeat Pangu will inherit his vast providence.”
 I see.
 The Sages were enlightened. In that case, they believed him.
 As Sages, they knew Sages the best. How many Sages could risk their lives for the sake of righteousness? Ancestor Xitian continued, “Alright, I’ve already said what needs to be said. I’ll leave the Heavenly Dao to you in the future.” With that said, Ancestor Xitian’s figure gradually vanished. He was like a phantom from head to toe. The Sages looked at each other. Han Jue stood up and prepared to leave. Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du stopped him and said, “Fellow Daoist Han, come to the Universal Hall.” Han Jue nodded, and the two Sages left.
 The other Sages were not curious. Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du often met the Sages alone. The Sages had also communicated in private. Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du had only arranged the matters of the Heavenly Dao and did not have any selfish motives.
 Universal Hall.
 Han Jue and Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du sat down. Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “Ancestor Xitian is suspicious of you. You have to be careful.” Han Jue said, “I understand.”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du’s favorability towards him far exceeded Ancestor Xitian’s. Han Jue also had a good impression of him. “I called you here this time to talk about the Reincarnation Space. I’ve decided to occupy the Earth Immortal World. Next, the Reincarnation Space will fight against the Infinite Space with all its might. After expelling the Infinite Space, I’ll let the Reincarnation Space occupy the Earth Immortal World and personally connect the providence of the Earth Immortal World to the Heavenly Dao to expand it,” Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said in a low voice.
 Seeing that he didn’t have to interfere, Han Jue put down his concerns and asked, “Are you confident?” “Don’t worry. Now that the mighty figures of the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End can’t make a move in time, Zhen Yuanzi has also been invited to the Ancient Desolate. The mysterious Chaotic Fiendcelestial of the Earth Immortal World and the Sage behind the Infinite Space are not the Freedom Sages and are not my match. I’m the best choice for this task. After all, my master is still very intimidating. After I leave, Fellow Daoist Han, help me keep an eye on Sect Master Tian Jue,” Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du continued.
 Sect Master Tian Jue?
 This fellow…
 Han Jue thought of the Heavenly Sect Master who was suppressed in the Ancient Desolate. Could it be that the Heavenly Sect Master was planning on backstabbing him? “I’ll keep an eye open.” “Yes, let’s talk about the Heavenly Dao…” Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du began to describe his next arrangements for the Heavenly Dao. It still had to continue expanding. The Flame Race had given the Sages too much stimulation. The living beings of the entire Heavenly Dao were actually unable to defeat the Chaotic Race. It was simply a great humiliation. The Sages would think of a way to increase the Spirit Qi in the Immortal World and constantly teach Dao techniques to increase the strength of all the living beings. However, where the rules of the Heavenly Dao were, it was impossible for them to increase without any worries. Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du mentioned Fang Liang. The Sages were thinking of a way to gather the Jade Slip of Creation for him. Fang Liang said that he had a way to expand the Heavenly Dao. Two hours later. Han Jue had just left the 33rd Heaven.
 He returned to the Hundred Peak Immortal River and sat on the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus. He asked in his mind, “Does Sect Master Tian Jue plan to betray the Heavenly Dao?” [4 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?] Continue!
 [Yes]
Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m Han Jue cursed silently.
 He was indeed a traitor.
 In that case, he wouldn’t be polite anymore. The next day. Han Jue came to Sect Master Tian Jue’s Dao Field. Sect Master Tian Jue opened a door and smiled at
 him.
 “Fellow Daoist Han, you are such a rare guest. Is this your first time visiting me?” Sect Master Tian Jue asked with a smile. Han Jue smiled. “Yes, I want to invite you to the Hundred Peak Immortal River as a guest. The Jie School has taken good care of the Holy Mother Sect. You and I can get closer.”
 The two of them spoke at the entrance of the Dao Field. Presumably, the other Sages could hear them.
 Sect Master Tian Jue smiled even wider. “That’s a good thing!”
 Han Jue grabbed his wrist affectionately and directly used the power of the Imprisonment Fiendcelestial to immobilize him. The two of them disappeared. At first glance, the two of them seemed to be leaving hand in hand. They were very close.
