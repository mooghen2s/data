 He prepared to curse Jade Emperor Zhou Yan until he was severely injured.
 He didn’t want this fellow to harm his grand-disciple.
 Han Jue cursed as he stared at the attributes panel.
 His lifespan had already decreased by 80 billion years!
 Even many stars couldn’t live that long!
 Continue!
 90 billion years!
 100 billion years!
 110 billion years!
 120 billion years!
 130 billion years!
 140 billion years!
 Han Jue’s heart started to bleed and he hesitated to continue.
 Damn it!
 Let’s go!
 He had already sacrificed so much. How could he give up?
 He would succeed if he persisted for a little longer!
 He couldn’t waste all his efforts!
 Han Jue insisted on cursing. Strands of strange black aura wrapped around his body. It was very strange and terrifying. Soon, his lifespan decreased by 150 billion years. Jade Emperor Zhou Yan was still persisting!
 Han Jue almost died of anger. He could only grit his teeth and continue.
 When Han Jue’s lifespan was deducted to nearly 170 billion years, he finally saw an email.
 (Because of your curse, your enemy Jade Emperor Zhou Yan’s Dao Fruit cracked. His mental demons haunted him. His Dharmic powers surged and he lost his mind.]
 Han Jue hurriedly stopped cursing.
 Almost 170 billion years of lifespan!
 Han Jue’s heart bled.
 Too painful.
 As expected of a Pseudo-Sage. Such curses only made him lose his mind.
 It seemed that if he wanted to use the curse to kill Jade Emperor Zhou Yan, he was underestimating the Pseudo-Sage. What Han Jue could do was to mess with the other party.
 After putting down the Book of Misfortune, Han Jue started to think hard. What should he do to kill Jade Emperor Zhou Yan?
 Han Jue suddenly thought of Xue Minghe. He had an idea.
 He immediately used his Mystical Power, Dark Nightmare, and sent him a dream.
 Immediately after, he entered the dream realm and saw Xue Minghe.
 This was a mountain peak. Xue Minghe was meditating. He suddenly opened his eyes and was pleasantly surprised to see Han Jue.
 He hurriedly stood up and knelt in front of him. “Greetings, Dark Forbidden Lord!”
 Han Jue pretended to be the Dark Forbidden Lord and said in a low voice, “I want Jade Emperor Zhou Yan dead.”
 Xue Minghe looked up and said without hesitation, “What do you need me to do? Just tell me!”
 Previously, he was present when Li Daokong repelled Jade Emperor Zhou Yan. The reason why Jade Emperor Zhou Yan retreated was clearly that he was cursed by the Dark Forbidden Lord.
 After that, Xue Minghe firmly believed that Jade Emperor Zhou Yan was not the Dark Forbidden Lord’s match!
 After being humiliated by him, Xue Minghe had been waiting for an opportunity.
 The opportunity had finally arrived!
 “Jade Emperor Zhou Yan wants to slaughter all living beings and replace the Dao Ancestor’s influence on the Heavenly Dao, controlling the Heavenly Dao alone. Spread this news,” Han Jue said.
 His tone was calm, and it was difficult to guess his emotions.
 Xue Minghe immediately said, “I’ll immediately let the Darkness Sect and the Asura Race spread the news!”
 He didn’t care if what Han Jue said was true. Even if it was a lie, he had a way to make it true!
 “Mm.”
 Han Jue stared at him and stopped talking.
 Feeling his gaze, Xue Minghe felt uneasy, not knowing what Han Jue was going to say. After a long while…
 Just as Xue Minghe was about to collapse, Han Jue suddenly dismissed the dream.
 After returning to the Connate Cave Abode, Han Jue was depressed.
 Why was Xue Minghe so obedient and did not ask for anything?
 Should he read his mind?
 Forget it.
 It didn’t mean much. Even if Xue Minghe was disobedient, it didn’t affect him.
 Han Jue felt that he couldn’t be addicted to spending his life.
 After reaching the Zenith Heaven Realm, it would take a long time to break through.
 He didn’t want to use up all his lifespan before it was refreshed again. Even if he used half, it wouldn’t be good.
Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m Habits were too terrifying and difficult to change.
 Han Jue performed Dark Nightmare again. This time, he used it on Jing Tiangong of the Jie School and told him the same thing.
 Jing Tiangong also agreed readily. However, unlike Xue Minghe, he asked Han Jue about the Jie School’s attitude.
 Han Jue replied ambiguously, claiming that if the Jie School did not become his enemy, he would not target them.
 Jing Tiangong was relieved and said that he would definitely defame Jade Emperor Zhou Yan.
 Han Jue was unhappy.
 What did he mean by defame?
 This was the truth!
 After dreaming twice, Han Jue stopped messing around and continued cultivating.
 He would visit the Heavenly Emperor in a few decades.
 Recently, the Heavenly Emperor seemed to have become peaceful. He didn’t cause trouble anymore, and no one cursed him.
 That made sense. Everyone thought that the Heavenly Emperor had already died.
 “Heavenly Emperor, wait a little longer. When I kill Jade Emperor Zhou Yan, you will be saved.”
 Han Jue thought silently. Killing a Pseudo-Sage required time. After all, Han Jue was not a Pseudo-Sage.
 In the Numinous Palace, the Immortal Gods gathered.
 An old immortal said, trembling, “Your Majesty, Jade Emperor Zhou Yan wants to slaughter all living beings and replace the Heavenly Dao. This matter has already spread to the heavens. The Heavenly Court can’t cooperate with him. On the contrary, we have to declare war on Jade Emperor Zhou Yan!”
 The Divine General stood up and said in a low voice, “That’s right. Jade Emperor Zhou Yan must die!”
 Li Daokong’s eyes were cold as he stared at Fang Liang.
 The hall was extremely noisy.
 Upon hearing that Fang Liang wanted to confer the title of Emperor to Jade Emperor Zhou Yan, the immortals exploded.
 The Heavenly Court was on the decline because of Jade Emperor Zhou Yan. Now that they were working with Jade Emperor Zhou Yan, where was the Heavenly Court’s backbone?
 Fang Liang said expressionlessly, “I’ve already heard your opinions. From now on, Jade Emperor Zhou Yan will be an eternal enemy of the Heavenly Court. At the same time, we will abolish Jade Emperor Zhou Yan’s position and sever his karma and faith with the Heavenly Court.”
 The immortals cheered upon hearing this.
 Li Daokong smiled.
 Li Xuan’ao clicked his tongue in wonder. “Severing karma and faith. How ruthless.”
 One moment ago, he was talking about conferring the Emperor title, and the next, he was cutting off Jade Emperor Zhou Yan’s escape route.
 Li Xuan’ao didn’t know if Fang Liang was a fence-sitter or ruthlessly decisive.
 No matter what Fang Liang thought, Jade Emperor Zhou Yan could forget about involving the Heavenly Court.
 Fang Liang looked at Ji Xianshen and asked, “How’s the situation overseas?”
 Ji Xianshen replied, “We have already recruited 100,000 immortals. Half of them are above the Heaven Immortal Realm.”
 The Literature Immortals were shocked.
 So many?
 Fang Liang smiled and said, “Can you continue recruiting?”
 “Yes, but we have to use the Divine Investiture Board. Those cultivators are worried. They hope to have the providence of immortals.” Ji Xianshen nodded.
 The Divine Investiture Board was a shackle to some immortals and gods, but to most people, it was a guarantee to step into the Immortal Realm.
 Immortals were not self-appointed. They needed to obtain the recognition of the Heavenly Dao, regardless of race. Under the Heavenly Dao, immortals were treated better than all living beings. There was no dispute.
 It was precisely because of this that immortals did not dare to rashly create slaughter, afraid of violating the heavenly rules and attracting monstrous negative karma.
 Fang Liang asked, “Has the human race expanded overseas?”
 Ji Xianshen shook his head and said, “No, the humans are consolidating internally.”
 At this moment, a Literature Immortal stood up and said, “Your Majesty, the humans have declared that they want to destroy the Numinous Palace and must be suppressed. They shouted that humans should be ranked higher than immortals and gods, stirring up the hearts of the people. This is not a good sign!”
 Humans should rank higher than immortals!
 Fang Liang couldn’t help but frown. The immortals were the same.
