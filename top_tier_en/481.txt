 “I was wrong!”
 “I was wrong!”
 Near the Hundred Peak Immortal River, Long Hao knelt on the mountaintop and kept kowtowing
 One by one, the disciples of the Hidden Sect rushed over. Because they were separated by the array formation, they could only look at Long Hao from afar.
 Tu Ling’er was pleasantly surprised. She didn’t expect Long Hao to still be alive.
 After all, she had watched him grow up and had always treated him as a junior.
 The other disciples were also very happy. After all, they were old friends.
 Zhou Fan curled his lips. “I didn’t expect the high-spirited Dragon Emperor to kowtow and apologize.”
 Clearly, he had met Long Hao in the calamity.
 The Black Hell Chicken smiled. “He’s your senior brother.”
 Zhou Fan was silent.
 Zhao Xuanyuan sighed. “I didn’t expect Long Hao to survive. In that case, the Hidden Sect is the greatest winner of the calamity.”
 The others also discussed.
 Only Su Qi, Fang Liang, and Yang Tiandong had yet to return.
 At the mention of Yang Tiandong, the Chaotic Heavenly Dog couldn’t help but ask, “Do you think Yang Tiandong is still alive?”
 After all, it had gone through thick and thin with him.
 “In the calamity, the cycle of reincarnation collapsed. Senior Brother Yang has fallen into the cycle of reincarnation. He’s probably doomed…” Xun Chang’an frowned.
 Yang Tiandong was a great pity for the Hidden Sect.
 Most importantly, Yang Tiandong’s death was a warning. He had taken the initiative to challenge others and was killed.
 Dao Comprehension Sword smiled and said, “Don’t worry, Master definitely has a way. We can cultivate well and listen to him. Yang Tiandong and Long Hao didn’t listen to Master and ended up like this.”
 The others nodded. Although life in the Hidden Sect was boring, it was safe.
 Long Hao had to kowtow for a thousand years, so even if they asked, they wouldn’t receive a reply.
 Year after year, the disciples stopped visiting him. They believed that after he finished kowtowing, Han Jue would naturally let him in.
 A thousand years was a long time before the calamity, but after it, it was very fast.
 A thousand years soon passed.
 Long Hao was already in a daze. He felt that his knees had taken root.
 When his vision blurred, he suddenly woke up and discovered that he was kneeling in a Daoist temple. The figure sitting in front of him was Han Jue.
 Under the light of the Sun and Moon Yin-Yang Protection, Han Jue looked so unfathomable.
 Long Hao was filled with reverence. He kowtowed while trembling and shouted, “Mas… Master…”
 He had never expected an apology to be so painful.
 This was even more terrifying than being in the endless purgatory!
 As he kowtowed and apologized, the past kept appearing in his mind. All sorts of emotions and experiences turned into one word: regret.
 Han Jue said, “Hao Tian, come out.”
 He could feel a powerful soul hidden in Long Hao’s body, but it seemed to be severely injured and was not a threat at all.
 Hearing this, a soul body rose above Long Hao’s head. It was Hao Tian.
 Hao Tian looked at Han Jue and smiled. “The younger generation is truly impressive.”
 He was secretly nervous.
 He couldn’t see through Han Jue at all. It felt like he was facing a Sage.
 Han Jue said, “You and Hao’er have already become one. I don’t object. However, if you want to enter my Hidden Sect, you have to forget about the past. From now on, you will focus on pursuing eternal life. Without my permission, you are not allowed to go out.”
 Hao Tian nodded. He was already mentally prepared before coming.
 Han Jue directly opened the authority to the simulation trial to them.
 He believed that after they tried for a period of time, they would return.
 Han Jue waved his hand and gestured for them to leave.
 Soon, the other disciples rushed over. They surrounded Long Hao and asked him all at once.
 Looking at the current Hidden Sect, Long Hao felt both unfamiliar and relaxed.
 This was his true home!
 After understanding it, Long Hao and Hao Tian were shocked.
 The Hidden Sect actually had more than 200 Immortal Emperors. A total of 10,000 experts!
 This number…
 How terrifying!
 Even the Heavenly Court at its peak did not have so many Immortal Emperors!
 How did Han Jue do it?
 “Come, come, come. Let’s enter the simulation trial and play. You’ll definitely be even more shocked,” the Black Hell Chicken said with ill intentions.
 The others also revealed strange smiles. They had all experienced the simulation trial, so they looked forward to Long Hao’s reaction.
 Indeed.
 In less than a day, Long Hao was immersed and could not extricate himself.
 It was as if he and Hao Tian had opened a brand new world. He didn’t expect the Hidden Sect to hide so deeply. Han Jue had fought with so many experts.
 Hao Tian did not have to use Long Hao’s body in the simulation trial, allowing him to enjoy the battle that he had not experienced for a long time.
 Not long after, Hao Tian discovered someone.
 Ancestor Xitian!
ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m Impossible!
 Han Jue had even fought with Ancestor Xitian?
 Hao Tian tried but was blown to death by Ancestor Xitian.
 How terrifying!
 Han Jue was definitely not a junior. He must be an ancient mighty figure who had always kept a low profile!
 For a time, Hao Tian’s mentality began to change.
 (Hao Tian has a favorable impression of you. Current favorability: 5 stars]
 Han Jue looked at the favorability notification and didn’t care.
 Now, he no longer cared about Hao Tian.
 If he decided to follow the Hidden Sect in the future, Han Jue would not mind.
 Having one more person cultivate the Great Dao of Extreme Origin was also a good thing for him.
 He continued to cultivate.
 At this moment, a vast heavenly might descended.
 “I’m Ancient Fiendish Yin. Today, I will use Connate lifeforms to create the Ancient Race. I’m willing to lead the Ancient Race to civilization and prosperity. I will expel the ferocious beasts of the Heavenly Dao and return the Heavenly Dao to prosperity!”
 The voice resounded through the sky.
 Han Jue raised his eyebrows.
 Who was this fellow?
 Why had he never heard of it before?
 He really knew how to gamble. He directly established his race with the first batch of Connate lifeforms. How daring!
 They were probably cannon fodder!
 Han Jue couldn’t even be bothered to derive Ancient Fiendish Yin’s identity.
 The Heavenly Dao Race had already decided whether the ancient races would either live or die.
 Although Han Jue didn’t care, the forces remaining in the Immortal World were shocked.
 Under the Fusang Tree.
 Long Hao opened his eyes, and Hao Tian appeared. He sighed. “Ancient Fiendish Yin, this person is an Immeasurable Emperor. He has experienced the Immeasurable Calamity several times. I didn’t expect that he would dare to be the first. Looks like he’s full of confidence.”
 The Black Hell Chicken asked curiously, “Is this person very strong?”
 Hao Tian nodded. “Absolutely.”
 Pseudo-Sage!
 The Black Hell Chicken was speechless. A Pseudo-Sage was too far away from it.
 On the endless wasteland, a lone peak stood.
 A figure stood at the top of the mountain. Majestic, he wore green leather armor. His black hair was wild, and he held a huge spear in his hand.
 He was Ancient Fiendish Yin. He looked down at the densely packed Connate lifeforms in the wasteland, his eyes filled with joy.
 “A talent visible to the naked eye. This is my right to break through to the Sage Realm!”
 Ancient Fiendish Yin smiled. He had already formed a plan in his mind.
 First, he had to enlighten these Connate lifeforms and help them transform!
 At this moment…
 A Connate lifeform that looked like a huge turtle said, “What right do you have to be our leader?”
 Upon hearing this, the eyes of many Connate lifeforms flickered.
 Some of the Connate lifeforms present had already developed their own intelligence.
 Ancient Fiendish Yin looked at the Connate lifeforms who had ill intentions and frowned.
 Strange.
 How did their intelligence grow so quickly?
 Most importantly, they were ambitious!
