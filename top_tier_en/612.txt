 He had worked with Han Jue and didn’t want the other Sages to be afraid and hostile towards him.
 Since ancient times, there had been several times when a Sage had been too strong and was surrounded by other Sages.
 Of course, Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du felt that these Sages weren’t Han Jue’s match. He was just afraid that they would die.
 “That’s right. As long as we kill the Dark Sage King, anything is fine.”
 “Why do I feel that we’re not needed anymore?”
 “Why not? If not for us asking our seniors to take action and coming personally, how would Fellow Daoist Han dare to come? He would think that it was a trap.”
 “Tsk tsk, Fellow Daoist Han is so powerful, but he’s so cautious. How strange.” “It’s good to be cautious. Han Jue never takes the initiative to become enemies. He was forced to take action. This is something worth learning. If we unite and strengthen the Heavenly Dao, our cultivation levels will definitely increase. Perhaps it will be a better outcome if Sages don’t fight among themselves.”
 The Sages communicated as they ran.
 Han Jue appeared in front of Immortal Emperor Samsara and asked him to immediately end the Invocation Technique and cut off the black vortex.
 Immortal Emperor Samsara did as he was told, then asked curiously, “What happened? Why are you in such a hurry?” Han Jue said, “We were fighting just now.” “With who?”
 “An existence that surpasses the Heavenly Dao Sages.”
 Immortal Emperor Samsara was stunned.
 He suddenly recalled the last time he used the Invocation Technique, that terrifying aura.
 What kind of existence was Han Jue?
 After Han Jue asked Immortal Emperor Samsara to cancel the Invocation Technique, he came to the second Dao Field.
 (The Chaos Deity’s hatred towards you has increased. Current Hatred Points: 6 stars]
 Great!
 Time to use the Book of Misfortune!
 Han Jue cursed silently. The Great Dao Divine Spirit guarding the Chaotic Order was actually the Dark Sage King’s backing!
 He didn’t think too much about it. In any case, the Chaotic Deity was only a Great Dao Divine Spirit and couldn’t enter his Dao Field.
 Inside the Daoist temple.
 Han Jue let Han Tuo out.
 Han Tuo lay on the ground unconscious. Han Jue waved his hand and pulled out a soul.
 It was the white-robed man Han Tuo had encountered in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End.
 This was only a soul fragment.
 The white-robed man had a solemn expression as he asked, “Who are you? You can actually kill the Dark Sage King. Do you know who’s behind him?”
 Han Jue directly killed him. Since it was not his main body, something would happen if he kept it here.

 Hatred notifications began to appear in front of Han Jue. He was stunned.
 A total of 26 mighty figures had developed hatred towards him, many of which were names that had appeared in Chinese mythology.
 What happened?
 Han Jue was shocked. He checked the portraits of these mighty figures and heaved a sigh of relief when he discovered that there was no Dao Creator.
 To be safe, Han Jue still used the derivation function.
 “Can the mighty figures who developed hatred towards me just now break through the array formation of my Dao Field?”.

 Continue!
 [No]
 Han Jue completely relaxed.
 After calming down, he figured it out.
 Could it be that these mighty figures were behind the Dark Sage King?
 Then, why did these mighty figures still help them, the Sages, restrain the existence behind the Dark Sage King? Self-directed drama?
 Han Jue was terrified. Could it be that the mighty figures wanted to use the Dark Sage King to shatter the Heavenly Dao?
 Why was this happening?
 Han Jue couldn’t figure it out.
 [Dijun sent you a dream. Do you accept?]
 When Han Jue saw this notification, he didn’t agree immediately but asked, “Will I be in danger if I accept his dream?”
 (150 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 (No]
 Relieved, Han Jue accepted Dijun’s dream.
 In the dream, the two of them stood above the clouds.
 Dijun stared at him and asked in a low voice, “When did you attain the Freedom Realm?”
 To prevent the mighty figures from thinking of the Great Dao of Extreme Origin, Han Jue couldn’t help but say, “To be honest, I was originally at the Freedom Realm. Han Jue is only part of my training in the Immortal World in this life.”
 Dijun frowned.
 If what Han Jue said was true and they didn’t see through him before, didn’t that mean that Han Jue’s main body might be stronger than them?
 Han Jue pretended to be calm. Dijun was still his good friend, and there was no hatred for the time being, so Han Jue wanted to hear what he had to say.
 “You killed the Dark Sage King. This is not good,” Dijun said faintly.
 Han Jue said, “I killed him for the Heavenly Dao. The other Sages begged me to help. I believe the mighty figures of the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End will protect us.”
 Dijun said, “Indeed. Are you really only protecting the Heavenly Dao?”
 “What else?”
 Dijun stared at him.
 Han Jue also had a guess, but he didn’t say it, as if he didn’t know that 26 mighty figures were hostile towards him. “If the Heavenly Dao is in danger in the future, don’t do anything. We have arrangements in place.”
 With that, Dijun ended the dream.
 In reality.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and asked in his mind, “Is Dijun also one of the Dark Sage King’s backing?”

 Han Jue’s heart sank.
DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎 “Is the reason these mighty figures self-directed this drama to destroy the Heavenly Dao to overthrow the Dao Ancestor’s lineage?”
 Han Jue could only think of this reason.

 [Yes]
 Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief.
 Being targeted by so many mighty figures was not a good thing. Han Jue’s only advantage was the Dao Field. He couldn’t go out easily in the future.
 Those mighty figures didn’t know that he had already guessed the truth and might not directly fall out with him. At most, they would be wary of his identity. Dijun was the best example.
 Han Jue was confused.
 What was going on?
 [Empress Nüwa sent you a dream. Do you accept it?]
 Accept! Han Jue entered the dream again and saw Nüwa.
 The dream was the mountain range of Buzhou Divine Mountain. The scenery was magnificent.
 Nüwa asked, “Han Jue, what’s your relationship with the Dao Ancestor?” Indeed, it was another suspicion!
 Han Jue said, “It’s fine. Why do you ask?”
 He pretended to be puzzled. “I only killed the Dark Sage King. Why did all the seniors come to visit me in my dreams? Did I kill the wrong person?”
 Nüwa shook her head. “No, you killed the right person. It’s just that your strength surprised?us.”
 Who are you trying to fool?!
 I’ve already deduced your conspiracy!
 Han Jue frowned. “Isn’t it good that I’m powerful? I can protect the Heavenly Dao.”
 “That’s right, but why do you have the Buzhou Divine Mountain? Back then, the Buzhou Divine Mountain was broken by the Ancestral Magus, and the remaining mountain was taken away by the Dao Ancestor…” Nüwa asked with deep meaning.
