 He wanted to get rid of the black aura!
 This killing intent shocked him.
 “What’s wrong with me?”
 Su Qi didn’t understand his state of mind. He felt that he had changed. He looked at his body. It was like a soul, but he felt blood flowing.
 “Don’t worry. Cultivate well. I’m here.”
 A familiar voice sounded. Su Qi wanted to cry.
 It’s indeed Master!
 Su Qi felt that if anyone in the world would save him, it would only be his master.
 Su Qi hurriedly asked, “Master, where am I? What’s around me?”
 Han Jue didn’t hide anything and told him his plan to create the Chaotic Fiendcelestial, including the fact that Su Qi was already the Death Fiendcelestial.
 After he finished speaking, Su Qi was shocked.
 Chaotic Fiendcelestial!
 He had heard of the Chaotic Fiendcelestial. It was an existence from before the creation of the world. Thinking of it, it would always be on par with the creation of the Giant God Pangu.
 What kind of existence is Master?
 Could it be that he had already died countless years ago and his master had already attained the Dao and even surpassed the Heavenly Dao?
 Su Qi was excited. The thought of becoming a Chaotic Fiendcelestial made him unable to help but think of the future.
 He could finally escape the fate of being a jinx!
 “Master, what Fiendcelestial am I?” “Death Fiendcelestial.”
 “Uh…”
 Su Qi was stunned.
 Was there a difference between the God of Misfortune and the Death Fiendcelestial?
 He still couldn’t escape his fate!
 “Don’t worry. You’re no longer restricted by the Heavenly Dao. Control your power well. You won’t be like before.”
 Han Jue consoled. Hearing this, the gloominess on Su Qi’s face disappeared. He trusted his master completely.
 The master and disciple chatted for a long time.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and sighed.
T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by nov(ê(l)biin.co/m Seeing that Su Qi woke up, he heaved a sigh of relief. He had been worried that Su Qi would die from his experiment.
 Fortunately, there was no danger. From now on, Su Qi was considered reborn. As a Chaotic Fiendcelestial, his potential would be stronger than Li Daokong and Dao Sovereign!
 Han Jue smiled and continued cultivating.
 He planned to hide the matter of Su Qi first and wait for him to become a Sage.
 The Heavenly Dao Sage position was limited, but the path Han Jue took had nothing to do with the Heavenly Dao. The Heavenly Dao couldn’t control it.
 Time passed.
 Sixty years later.
 The Hundred Peak Immortal River welcomed another visitor.
 “Han Jue, I’m Emperor Xiao’s avatar. I’m here for a visit.”
 Hearing this voice, Han Jue did not open his eyes.
 Why was this fellow here?
 Is something the matter?
 Han Jue used the simulation trial first.
 [Emperor Chen: Perfected Pseudo-Sage Realm, Sage’s Dharma Idol, Human Emperor, Immeasurable Emperor]
 Eh?
 The Sage of the Devil Race actually had the identity of a Human Emperor?
 Han Jue couldn’t complain anymore and started the simulation trial.
 Instant kill!
 After thinking about it, Han Jue directly moved Emperor Chen into the Daoist temple and didn’t give him a chance to wander around. The Daoist temple had a system barrier, and Emperor Chen’s divine sense couldn’t penetrate it.
 Emperor Chen was stunned.
 He subconsciously spread his divine sense, but it was isolated by the mysterious restriction.
 He immediately understood. It seemed that Han Jue did not want him to see the Dao Field’s interior.
 “Why has the Sage come here?” Han Jue asked.
 Emperor Chen sat down and said, “I want to invite you to my Dao Field. You’re too cautious, so I can only come personally.”
 Han Jue didn’t say anything and waited for him to continue.
 Emperor Chen said, “To be honest, I’m a Sage of the Devil Race. A long time ago, the Dao Ancestor stepped on the Devil Race to attain the Dao, but he didn’t kill them all and gave them a chance of survival. Even so, the Devil Race has always been suppressed, and most of the sins in the world are blamed on us. Everyone thinks it’s natural as long as the Devil Race is responsible for the sins.
 “After the Dao Ancestor left, the situation of the Devil Race became even more difficult. Now, the four Sages of the Dao Sect are plotting something. Qiu Xilai took in Sage Fated Secrets, who has transformed into a Mad Sage. Fuxitian also has a close relationship with Qiu Xilai. The Sages have already divided into two factions. If you and I don’t join forces, we will probably be targeted.”
 Han Jue was silent and didn’t answer immediately.
 It was very important for Sages to differentiate factions. After all, they had to fight for providence.
 As for Han Jue, providence was not necessary.
 However, the Sages were plotting against him. He had to disgust them.
 Previously, Sect Master Tian Jue had called for all living beings to besiege the Hundred Peak Immortal River. There were also the Three Pure Sacred Ancestor, Thousand Madness Devil, and other mighty figures attacking.
 Han Jue said, “What do I have to do to join forces with you? What’s your plan?”
 Han Jue could do it alone. If he worked with Emperor Xiao, he was worried that he would be implicated.
 After all, it was the Devil Race!
 Han Jue admitted that he was indeed biased against the devils.
 Emperor Chen said, “I don’t need you to do anything for the time being. I’ll do what I want. If it involves a faction conflict, I’ll only need you to help. Of course, if you need my help, just tell me. I’ll consider my actions.”
 Han Jue changed his opinion of Emperor Xiao. At least, he did not look greedy.
 However, there was the mysterious Devil Ancestor behind him. Han Jue didn’t dare to agree rashly.
 “How about this? I’ll consider it again. If I want to cooperate with a Sage, I’ll definitely choose you first. To be honest, I know that the other Sages have plotted against me. I won’t join forces with them. You can rest assured about this,” Han Jue said seriously.
 Emperor Chen frowned, but he did not say anything
 Their conversation was short.
 Five minutes later, Han Jue sent Emperor Chen out.
 After Emperor Chen left, Han Jue suddenly had an idea.
 “I want to know who has the strongest providence of the Heavenly Dao before the next calamity begins.”
 Han Jue asked in his mind.
 [4 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Four billion only!
 Continue!
 A figure appeared in Han Jue’s mind.
 Qiu Xilai!
 Han Jue raised his eyebrows.
 Why was it him?
 Could it be that the Heavenly Dao was supporting him?
 “I already want to fight for providence. Why isn’t it me?” Han Jue frowned.
 “I want to know how my relationship with Qiu Xilai will be when the next calamity begins.”
 (You have already become a Sage. You can’t deduce yourself anymore. Otherwise, karma will surge in reverse and the Great Dao will reject you.]
 Can’t deduce?
 Han Jue was vexed.
 “Then, I want to know how my Hidden Sect will be faring before the next calamity.”
 [Ten billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 Han Jue entered the illusion.
 He opened his eyes again and saw that he had arrived at the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 He frowned. The Hundred Peak Immortal River had actually been razed to the ground. It was barren. Even the Fusang Tree was no longer there.
 “Could it be that I’ll move the Dao Field away in the future?”
 Han Jue frowned and thought that it was very likely.
 At this moment, he saw a figure standing on the wasteland.
 He focused his gaze and discovered that it was Li Daokong.
 Li Daokong held his sword in one hand. His hair was disheveled as he looked up at the sky.
 In the crimson sky, it was as if dusk had arrived. Above the layers of clouds, six peerlessly mighty figures could be seen.
 South Extreme Heavenly Venerate, Sect Master Tian Jue, Sage Jin’an, Qiu Xilai, Fuxitian, and Sage Fated Secrets.
 (South Extreme Heavenly Venerate snorted. “The Hidden Sect no longer exists. Your sect master is isolated by the Heavenly Dao. Li Daokong, I’ll give you another chance. Kneel down!”
