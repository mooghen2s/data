 80 trillion years!
 Curses were too expensive. When using the derivation function, it was unlikely to exceed a trillion years of lifespan.
 Killing enemies and obtaining information were indeed two different matters!
 Han Jue gritted his teeth and persisted.
 He would stop at 100 trillion years. These dogs were too ruthless.
 Han Jue thought silently.
 90 trillion years!
 95 trillion years!
 (Because of your curse, your enemy, Sage Jin’an, lost his Sage Heart and became a Mad Sage.]
 Han Jue immediately stopped. His forehead was covered in sweat.
 He was nervous!
 Fortunately, he succeeded!
 Han Jue cursed silently. This consumed too much energy.
 He couldn’t curse any more next time. He might as well do it himself!
 Han Jue recalled that he had copied Sage Jin’an’s data before. He began the simulation trial and challenged him.
 Soon, Han Jue opened his eyes again.
 Sage Jin’an was something!
 He was stronger than Fuxitian and was faster than Li Muyi.
 Han Jue continued the simulation trial and looked for a way to insta-kill the other party.
 Several months passed. When Li Daokong came to find him, the fastest Han Jue killed Sage Jin’an was using three breaths of time.
 Not enough!
 Far from it!
 If he couldn’t insta-kill the enemy, he would be insta-killed!
 Han Jue sighed and let Li Daokong enter the Daoist temple.
 “Sect Master, recently, my cultivation has increased again. I believe that among the Pseudo-Sages, no one can do anything to me. I can represent the Hidden Sect to fight for the Sage position. What do you think?” Li Daokong asked.
 He stared at him with a serious expression.
 Han Jue said, “You want the Primordial Purple Qi?”
 Li Daokong nodded.
 Han Jue raised his right hand, and the Primordial Purple Qi appeared in his hand. He said, “I have it. You don’t have to go out. It’s just that if you rely on the Primordial Purple Qi to attain the Dao now, your future achievements among Sages won’t be high.”
 Li Daokong’s eyes widened as he looked at Han Jue’s right hand in disbelief.
 He rarely showed such an expression.
 He was really shocked this time.
 Why did Han Jue have the Primordial Purple Qi?
 Could it be that the Dao Sect was not slandering Han Jue when they surrounded him?
Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m Han Jue didn’t hide anything and told him about Li Muyi helping Xuan Qingjun.
 Li Daokong sighed. He had once respected Li Muyi the most. Now that he looked at him, he felt that his master was really despicable. He wasn’t as righteous as he looked.
 “Cultivate well. When you reach the perfected Pseudo-Sage Realm, this Primordial Purple Qi will belong to you. On the contrary, if the other disciples reach it first, you can forget about it,” Han Jue said calmly.
 He indeed thought highly of Li Daokong, but he couldn’t show it too clearly.
 Li Daokong took a deep breath, bowed, and left.
 Han Jue thought of the Great Dao Purple Qi.
 He didn’t decide who to give it to for the time being. He wanted to see the disciples’ performance first.
 Then, Han Jue continued cultivating.
 After becoming a Sage, he had yet to cultivate.
 The cultivation of a Sage was no longer breathing exercises but comprehending the Great Dao. The deeper one’s understanding and control of the Great Dao, the higher one’s cultivation would be.
 Han Jue had grasped the Great Dao of Extreme Origin and could continue cultivating.
 The Primordial Chaos Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal was not his limit!
 When he began cultivating, the Primordial World in the depths of his soul began to surge with Chaotic Qi and nebulous Primordial Qi.
 His world of stars had already been renamed Primordial World. The Fiendcelestial Qi was still being nurtured. The Chaotic Origin Stone was producing Chaotic Qi faster and faster.
 The Reroll World was extremely tiny and couldn’t keep up with the Primordial World’s development.
 If not for Han Jue’s Dharmic powers isolating it, the Reroll World would probably be crushed by the Stellar Primordial Body’s nebulous Primordial Qi.
 Han Jue had to think of a way to completely fuse the Reroll World and the Primordial World.
 What should he do?
 Han Jue thought of the White-Robed Buddha.
 The White-Robed Buddha controlled the current Reroll World’s providence. Both sides lived together. If the White-Robed Buddha fused with the Primordial World, the Reroll World would naturally be the same?
 How should he fuse them?
 Han Jue thought of Su Qi again. Why not let the White-Robed Buddha imitate him?
 “Let’s wait and see for a while.”
 Han Jue closed his eyes and didn’t say anything else.
 In the blink of an eye, five hundred years passed.
 After Han Jue succeeded in attaining the Dao, the Sages didn’t find trouble with him anymore. Qiu Xilai didn’t even visit his dreams. Peace returned to the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 Han Jue had also been cultivating.
 Already five thousand Nether Race members had stepped into the Deity Realm. The Nether Race’s talent was outstanding. In order to ensure their talent, Empress Houtu even sacrificed their reproduction ability. Now, the Immortal Qi in the Dao Field was definitely the richest place below the Heavenly Dao. In addition, Han Jue would preach the Dao from time to time, so their cultivation levels naturally increased. They almost didn’t encounter any bottlenecks.
 After attaining the Dao, Han Jue no longer cared about the Deity Realm. His current requirement for his disciples was the Zenith Heaven Realm.
 On this day.
 Xing Hongxuan came to find Han Jue.
 After half a year, Xing Hongxuan put on her clothes and sat beside him. She asked, “Husband, why do I feel that you’ve changed?”
 She felt that Han Jue wasn’t as cold as before. There was more humanity in him now.
 Of course, she couldn’t say it directly.
 Han Jue thought for a moment and told her about his experience in the mortal world.
 Xing Hongxuan wasn’t angry after hearing that. She wasn’t his only woman. Speaking of which, Han Jue had very few women compared to others of the same realm.
 Xing Hongxuan sighed. “That Qingluan’er had some affinity with you. Aren’t you going to help her cultivate?”
 Han Jue said calmly, “There’s no need. The person she knows is only a mortal, but I left her soul behind. I’ll plan in the future.”
 Han Jue originally wanted to let Qingluan’er reincarnate directly, but before she died, his heart softened.
 He thought of Han Tuo.
 He had to at least leave behind a relative for him.
 Yes, that’s what I thought.
 Han Jue thought silently.
 “Then, what about your son? He’s not returning to the Hidden Sect? Husband, why aren’t you having a child with me? No, I want to give birth now!” Xing Hongxuan asked and started to move. She raised her hand to take off his clothes.
 Han Jue glared at her and said angrily, “What cultivation level are you at? Hurry up and cultivate. If you have a child, can you still cultivate properly?”.
 Xing Hongxuan curled her lips. “Then, what cultivation level do I need to make our child?”
 Han Jue said, “The meaning of having a son is to inherit. We have to live forever. Having a son is not important. If you really want to, when you reach the Zenith Heaven Realm, I will leave a son for you.”
 “Really?”
 “Really!”
 After receiving Han Jue’s promise, Xing Hongxuan beamed.
 Her mentality had already changed. She felt that the Zenith Heaven Realm was not unattainable.
 Xing Hongxuan asked, “Where’s Han Tuo? Are you really going to let him go? If not, bring him back. I’ll help you take care of him. No matter what, he’s still your child.”
 Han Jue shook his head. “After so many years, he has already grown up. Ignore him. One day, when he needs me, I will help. It’s just that it’s not suitable now.”
 Han Tuo had inherited his bloodline and was very likely to become the second Primordial Fiendcelestial.
 Besides cultivating, Han Jue would still care about Han Tuo.
 This kid had just experienced love a while ago. Unfortunately, it ended without a cause. Because he wasn’t strong enough, he couldn’t protect his wife. He began to cultivate diligently. This was a good thing.
 Han Jue hoped that after Han Tuo experienced the myriad worlds, he would have the same pure cultivation heart as him.
