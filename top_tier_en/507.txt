 (4 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 (Yes]
 Han Jue frowned. Li Daokong was right.
 He took out the Book of Misfortune and decided to cause trouble for the Sages.
 He couldn’t directly curse Li Muyi or the Sages of the Chan School. He had to think of a way to drive them away.
 Yes!
 Han Jue decided to curse Qiu Xilai. He didn’t use much strength and just wanted to scare him.
 On the surface, he and Qiu Xilai were still on good terms. The other party wouldn’t suspect him and would only suspect other Sages.
 Sage Li Muyi wouldn’t suspect Han Jue. They were thinking of dealing with him. It didn’t make sense for Han Jue to provoke the other Sages now.
 Just like that, Han Jue started cursing Qiu Xilai.
 Five days later, his lifespan began to decrease.
 He would only curse for five days. If it was too much, it would be meaningless.
 He had to at least curse the other party until he was vexed. His lifespan should be consumed between a trillion years and ten trillion years.
 Han Jue felt that it was enough after he had spent three trillion years.
 Outside the 33rd Heaven, in the Western Hall.
 Qiu Xilai frowned.
 He was targeted by the Dark Forbidden Lord again!
 This time, he clearly felt that the curse power of the Dark Forbidden Lord was far greater than before.
 Thinking of Sage Fated Secrets’ miserable state, his heart couldn’t help but palpitate.
 “Who is it?”
 Qiu Xilai’s eyes flickered. The Dark Forbidden Lord was definitely one of the Heavenly Dao Sages. This was already a publicly acknowledged fact in the Sage circle. Other than them, only Ancestor Xitian was left. It was impossible for him to do such a thing.
 Qiu Xilai began to recall the recent past and felt that Li Muyi was the most likely.
 Previously, Li Muyi asked him to control Han Jue, but he rejected him.
 However, the karma was too obvious. If he were Li Muyi, he would definitely not curse himself.
 Li Muyi was famous for being cunning at the Sage level.
 It was not Li Muyi, so it could only be him.
 Qiu Xilai had always suspected the three schools of the Dao Sect. The Dao Sect was orthodox, and if he wanted to eliminate the Sages, he could only use curses.
 Could it be Sect Master Tian Jue?
 No!
 South Extreme Heavenly Venerate!
 This fellow couldn’t stand him.
 Sage Jin’an was also a possibility. This fellow did not reveal himself and was unfathomable.
 Qiu Xilai was even more afraid of Sage Jin’an because he didn’t know his weakness. Although Li Muyi was strong, he cared too much about his reputation and was very easy to target.
 The curse power was still strengthening. The more Qiu Xilai thought about it, the angrier he became.
 After spending three trillion years of his lifespan, Han Jue put down the Book of Misfortune, satisfied.
 He thought for a moment and started cursing Emperor Xiao.
 Apart from the three schools of the Dao Sect, all of them were cursed. Only then could he divert the trouble and make them suspect the Dao Sect.
 He spent another 3 trillion years.
 It was settled now.
 Han Jue thought silently and put away the Book of Misfortune.
 After making arrangements, he heaved a sigh of relief.
 How wonderful.
 I hope you can fight soon!
 Han Jue smiled and continued cultivating.
 Qiu Xilai and Emperor Xiao weren’t good people and would definitely find trouble with the other Sages. The two of them thought about it and quickly suspected the Sages of the three schools.
 Time passed.
 Year after year passed.
 People broke through in the Hidden Sect every year. The number of in-name disciples had already exceeded a million and was still rapidly increasing.
 It had to be said that these in-name disciples’ reproduction ability was very strong. They were almost comparable to the humans. Han Zuitian realized this problem and hurriedly stopped them.
 Three hundred years later.
 An influential figure had appeared in the Hidden Sect, Long-arm Ape! He had risen too quickly in the hundred-year competition. After all, he was already Li Xuan’ao’s disciple and was qualified to participate in the simulation trial. His performance had also obtained the recognition of the other disciples. Everyone became more and more familiar with him, causing him to be like a bright star in the in-name disciples’ eyes. Most of the in-name disciples worshiped him.
 Han Jue knew about this and guessed that Li Xuan’ao was supporting the Long-arm Ape, but he didn’t take it to heart.
 The stronger the Long-arm Ape was, the stronger the Hidden Sect seemed. It couldn’t always only have a few stronger people.
 Han Jue even supported such actions. He hoped that the second-generation disciples could nurture admirable disciples.
 On this day.
 Han Jue was about to stand up and go out to preach the Dao when he suddenly caught an aura rapidly approaching the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 Very strong! Stronger than the Pseudo-Sage he had encountered!
 He focused his gaze and saw a huge Daoist figure rising in the sky. Upon careful look, it wasn’t rising, but the other party was rapidly approaching.
 In front of this Daoist, everything in the world seemed short. He was at least a million feet tall, or even more.
 He had white hair and wore a green Daoist robe. His eyes were sharp as if he could see through everything in the world. His gaze had already landed on the Hundred Peak Immortal River. Han Jue looked over and felt that the other party was looking at him.
 Han Jue immediately used the simulation trial test.
 (Three Pure Sacred Ancestor: Perfected Pseudo-Sage Realm, strongest in the Immortal World]
 Boom
 The Three Pure Sacred Ancestor struck the sky above the Hundred Peak Immortal River. Space distorted, forming a transparent indent that was visible to the naked eye. The scene was shocking; it was as if the sky was collapsing.
 The ground shook and all the disciples went out. They looked up and saw the Three Pure Sacred Ancestor looking down at the Hundred Peak Immortal River. They were all dumbfounded and in disbelief.
 “Who is this?”
 “I’ve never seen him before! Could he be a Sage?”
 “Sage? Could it be Sect Master Tian Jue?”
 “What should we do?”
 “Don’t panic, the array formation isn’t broken yet!”
 The disciples exclaimed in fear.
 The Three Pure Sacred Ancestor waved his palm again and struck the Hundred Peak Immortal River. It was still isolated by the Dao Field array formation and did not cause any substantial damage to the Dao Field.
 This time, the Three Pure Sacred Ancestor frowned.
 “What’s happening?”
 The Three Pure Sacred Ancestor was surprised. He had used his full strength, so why couldn’t he break through the formation?
 He took out a golden ruler from his sleeve and struck it down like a golden river descending from the sky.
 Han Jue walked out of the Dao Field. The divine light emitted by the Sun and Moon Yin-Yang Protection covered his body.
 The Three Pure Sacred Ancestor saw him immediately.
 His intuition told him that this person was very dangerous.
 Han Jue directly condensed the Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial Dharma Idol and quickly grew taller, becoming as majestic as the Three Pure Sacred Ancestor.
 Without another word, the Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial punched out. The terrifying aura suffocated everyone in the Dao Field.
 “It’s here!”
 Li Daokong’s eyes lit up as he stared at the Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial.
 He had often been beaten up by the Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial in the simulation trial. He couldn’t forget this terrifying Dharma idol.
 Under the feet of the Three Pure Sacred Ancestor and the Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial, all living beings were as tiny as sand.
 Boom
 The Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial’s fist wind collided with the Three Pure Sacred Ancestor, knocking him back. The golden ruler in his hand shook violently.

 What a domineering power!
 This was what the Ancestral Magus used to be!
 The Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial continued to punch. The Fiendcelestial Dharma Idol flew out of the Dao Field and leaped. As it fell, it punched at the Three Pure Sacred Ancestor. The terrifying wind directly collapsed the ground and mountains and rivers shattered.
 The Three Pure Sacred Ancestor raised his ruler and struck. Nine golden lotuses appeared behind him. They were dazzling like ancient divine objects that could create the world. It was addictive to look at and warranted worship.
