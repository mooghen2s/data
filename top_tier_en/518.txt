 He began to break through in seclusion.
 How could he break through?
 It was naturally to comprehend the Great Dao of Extreme Origin!
 His Dao heart had transformed into the Sage Heart, and his soul had transformed into the Sacred Soul!
 Fifty years later.
 The Hundred Peak Immortal River was enveloped by a vast aura, startling many disciples out of their cave abodes.
 “This aura…”
 “It’s the aura of a Sage! I’ve heard a Sage preach the Dao before. I still can’t forget this pressure!”
 “A Sage is attacking?”
 “No! Is Sect Master breaking through?”
 “Sect Master is indeed a Sage.”
 The disciples discussed, and the news quickly spread throughout the Hidden Sect.
 The disciples were relieved as long as this pressure was not from an enemy.
 As for Han Jue breaking through, most of the disciples felt that it was normal.
 His breakthrough speed was always very fast!
 The personal disciples were stimulated and cultivated even harder.
 At the same time.
 Han Jue’s consciousness entered a vast universe.
 It was the world of stars in the depths of his soul.
 Countless stars began to be born. The stars that already existed emitted a dazzling light, causing the entire world of stars to become resplendent.
 Above all the stars, countless nebulous Primordial Qi surged over and condensed together. As time passed, a palace condensed. Forty-nine Fiendcelestial stone statues condensed around the palace. They were sinister and terrifying. Their postures were different. The courtyard in the palace was separated, and each had its own strengths.
 Sacred Palace!
 This was also Han Jue’s Dao Fruit!
 After the nebulous Primordial Qi surged into the Sacred Palace, it transformed into higher-level Dharmic power, far exceeding before!
 Han Jue’s illusion appeared above the Sacred Palace. It was the manifestation of his soul. The holy power that overflowed from the Sacred Palace surged into the illusion of his soul and helped him transform. His soul body emitted seven-colored light that illuminated the entire world of stars.
 Han Jue seemed to have understood something as his voice echoed in the world of stars.
 “This world is called Primordial Chaos!”
 All the living beings in the world of stars heard Han Jue’s voice. They were in an uproar and didn’t understand who was speaking.
 Inside a palace.
 The White-Robed Buddha, who was cultivating, opened his eyes. His expression was strange as his eyes revealed shock.
 “Primordial Chaos… Chaos… What kind of existence is he?”
 The White-Robed Buddha had always been very curious about Han Jue’s background. He felt that Han Jue’s cultivation speed was really unreasonable. It was very likely that he was the reincarnation of a mighty figure. Now, Han Jue was not afraid of great karma and created the Primordial Chaos, which surprised him even more.
 Ignoring the White-Robed Buddha’s shock, Han Jue focused on breaking through.
 At the same time.
 In the 33rd Heaven, all the Sages in the various Dao Fields opened their eyes, including Ancestor Xitian.
Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎 Ancestor Xitian calculated with his fingers and frowned.
 He actually could not deduce it!
 “Who’s attaining the Dao?” Ancestor Xitian muttered to himself. He hesitated for a moment before standing up.
 On the other side.
 The four Sages of the Dao Sect gathered together.
 “Someone is attaining the Dao!” South Extreme Heavenly Venerate said in a low voice with an extremely ugly expression.
 Under their eyes, someone had actually reached the height of Dao attainment!
 Most importantly, they couldn’t guess where the other party was.
 Li Muyi’s eyes flickered. “Could it be the master of the Hidden Sect?”
 Sage Jin’an said, “Even if it’s not him, it’s related to the Hidden Sect. We Sages can’t enter the Immortal World. Our disciples can’t enter the Hundred Peak Immortal River and can only watch as he attains the Dao. Next, we have to consider changing our attitude towards the Hidden Sect.”
 Sect Master Tian Jue sighed.
 The four Sages fell silent.
 Apart from the four Sages of the Dao Sect, the other Sages were also shocked.
 Qiu Xilai even sent a dream to Han Jue.
 Han Jue ignored him.
 After a while, Qiu Xilai started to spam.
 (Qiu Xilai wants to visit you in your dreams. Do you accept?]
 (Qiu Xilai wants to visit you in your dreams. Do you accept?]
 (Qiu Xilai wants to visit you in your dreams. Do you accept?]
 [Detected that you are breaking through to attain the Dao. It has extraordinary significance. The system has activated the autonomous protection mechanism. You are temporarily immune to all dreams.)
 Han Jue was about to become furious when he saw the system’s words. He heaved a sigh of relief.
 Previously, he could still think that Qiu Xilai was doing this because of his personality. Now, he felt that Qiu Xilai was a lunatic!
 He would definitely seek revenge when he succeeded in attaining the Dao!
 Han Jue calmed down and continued to attain the Dao.
 He would become a Sage when his Sacred Palace successfully condensed and his soul transformed into a Sacred Soul!
 Another hundred years passed.
 Han Jue successfully attained the Dao!
 His Dharmic powers had completely transformed into Sage powers. It was endless!
 The Sacred Soul was born!
 Han Jue was so happy that he wanted to scream, but he held back.
 He checked his attributes panel.
 [Name: Han Jue]
 (Race: Primordial Fiendcelestial (Immeasurable Emperor)]
 [Cultivation: Early-stage Primordial Chaos Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm (Perfect Sage)] [Technique: Primordial Chaos Reincarnation Great Dao (Great Dao), Heavenly Cycle Body Tempering]
 (Great Dao: Great Dao of Life and Death, Great Dao of Karma, Great Dao of Extreme Origin]
 Primordial Chaos Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal!
 His lifespan was almost doubled!
 120 sextillion years!
 However, Han Jue was still a little puzzled.
 He couldn’t live forever even now?
 On second thought, this was already equivalent to eternal life. Such a lifespan was extremely long. Furthermore, he had been breaking through. Every time he broke through, his lifespan would be refreshed.
 Perhaps this was the Primordial Fiendcelestial’s definition of Undying and Imperishable!
 Han Jue stopped thinking and continued to consolidate his cultivation.
 At the same time.
 In the entire Hidden Sect, all cultivators who stepped into the Great Dao of Extreme Origin had their providence and cultivation increased.
 This feeling was extremely obvious, making them shocked.
 The personal disciples understood that it was because Han Jue was breaking through.
 The in-name disciples thought that Han Jue was using a Mystical Power.
 In a valley in the Immortal World.
 Han Tuo was meditating in the array formation when he suddenly opened his eyes and looked at his hands in shock.
 “What’s going on? Why did my cultivation speed suddenly increase?” Han Tuo muttered to himself, his eyes revealing surprise.
 He still remembered this feeling.
 It was the same thing when he was young. His potential suddenly exploded.
 Could it be that he had broken through his limits again?
 Han Tuo was very excited.
 “Just you wait. I’ll kill all of you when I successfully break through!”
 Han Tuo snorted and continued cultivating.
 Fifty years later, Han Jue’s cultivation completely stabilized.
 He had truly become a Sage!
 [Detected that you have used your strength to attain the Dao and become a Perfect Sage. You have the following choices:]
 [1: Exit seclusion immediately and suppress the heavens to become the strongest Sage. You can obtain a Mystical Power inheritance, a Heavenly Dao Spirit Stone, and a Great Dao Fragment.)
 [2: Cultivate in a low-profile manner and stay away from trouble. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment, a Supreme Treasure, a Heavenly Dao Spirit Stone, and a Sage-level Dao Field guard.]
 Han Jue chose the second option after seeing it.
 Sage-level Dao Field guard!
 So strong!
 (You chose to cultivate in a low-profile manner and obtained a Great Dao Fragment, a Supreme Treasure, a Heavenly Dao Spirit Stone, and a Sage-level Dao Field guard.]
 (Congratulations on obtaining the Heavenly Pure Dao Control Robe.]
 (Heavenly Pure Dao Control Robe: Defensive Heavenly Dao Supreme Treasure. It can defend against Karma Mystical Powers and can defend against the strongest attack of ordinary Sages.]
