 The black shadow said, “There’s something wrong between the Sages recently. We have to think of a way to rope Han Jue in. If he doesn’t come, you can send your clone over to show your potential. I’m worried that the Sages will attack the devils again.”
 Emperor Xiao frowned even more and could only sigh.
 “Forget it, I’ll go find him myself.”
 The same year.
 Heavenly Ancestor Ji Xianshen came to visit the Hundred Peak Immortal River. Han Jue moved him in and asked Li Xuan’ao to bring him around.
 Ji Xianshen was shocked.
 “Why is the Connate Qi here so dense? Impossible, it’s even denser than the Sage Dao Field!” Ji Xianshen shouted in his heart. He finally understood why the Hidden Sect had hundreds of Immortal Emperors.
 In the Dao Field here, even a pig could become an Immortal Emperor!
 Ji Xianshen was moved when he passed by the Nether Race’s territory.
 No!
 Not just Immortal Emperors!
 How did these guys reach the Deity Realm?
 Thousands of Deity Realm cultivators?
 Ji Xianshen couldn’t control his expression at all.
 Li Xuan’ao noticed the change in his expression and was extremely pleased. He smiled and said, “They’re our Hidden Sect’s Nether Zenith. Their potential is not bad.”
 Ji Xianshen couldn’t help but ask, “How many Deity Realm cultivators are there in the Hidden Sect?”
 Li Xuan’ao chuckled. “That’s hard to say.”
 Ji Xianshen saw his smile and wanted to hit him.
 “The Hidden Sect is actually so powerful. I’m afraid that all the forces in the entire Immortal World combined are inferior to it. If the Hidden Sect has a Sage, won’t they be able to directly control the Immortal World?”
 Ji Xianshen’s heart beat faster.
 He had never heard of any faction having thousands of Deity Realm existences. He had even suspected that there weren’t thousands of them in the Immortal World.
 Next, Ji Xianshen sensed several extremely powerful auras.
 Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal!
 There were actually several Zenith Heaven Golden Immortals in the Hidden Sect!
 When he arrived at Han Jue’s Daoist temple, he was almost frightened to death.
 “Sage… Sage?” Ji Xianshen asked with a trembling voice. He looked at Zhang Jue as if he had seen a ghost.
 Zhang Jue remained silent and continued meditating
 Li Xuan’ao said, “Sect Master, he’s here.”
 “Yes, you can leave. Ji Xianshen, come in.”
 Han Jue’s voice floated out.
 Ji Xianshen subconsciously walked over.
 When he passed by Zhang Jue, he was alarmed and did not dare to look at him.
 “Why is the Sage of the Human School here?”
 Ji Xianshen couldn’t figure it out.
 Could it be that Li Muyi was behind Han Jue?
 It was very likely!
 No wonder Li Daokong and Li Xuan’ao joined the Hidden Sect!
 Ji Xianshen was enlightened. All his doubts were resolved.
 After entering the Daoist temple, he was dazzled by the divine light of the Sun and Moon Yin-Yang Protection.
 Han Jue greeted him and activated Absolute Purification.
 After chatting for a few days, the Absolute Purification ended.
 Han Jue said, “Your hidden threat has been treated. It’s time to go back.”
 Ji Xianshen was stunned. He asked in surprise, “Done?”
 He carefully checked his body and discovered that his mental demons were gone. His limbs no longer rejected him.
 Could it be…
 Ji Xianshen was excited.
 He gritted his teeth and said, “Han Jue, I hope that the Hidden Sect will support me. I’m willing to join you. Can you agree?”
 Ji Xianshen lowered his head.
 He had always wanted to compare himself with Han Jue. He knew that once he said this, he wouldn’t be able to raise his head in front of him in the future.
 At least, he would never be as good as him.
 Han Jue asked, “If I support you, what can I obtain? What can the Hidden Sect obtain?”
 Ji Xianshen frowned, “Providence. Authority. What do you want? The Heavenly Race can serve you as long as I control them.”
 Han Jue remained silent.
 He subconsciously wanted to reject him.
 But on second thought, he was already a Sage. What was there to be afraid of?
 If the Heavenly Race could fight for providence and weaken the providence of the other Sages, their cultivation levels would also decrease.
 It was very difficult for the Heavenly Dao Sages to become stronger. They were bound by the Heavenly Dao. Their strength was different. It mainly depended on the providence of their Dao. This was also why so many times after the calamity ended, when the Heavenly Dao Race alternated, only the Dao teachings of the Sages remained. Why would a Sage use the calamity as a chessboard?
 s
 a
 Wasn’t it just a legitimate fight for providence!
 Not everyone had the courage to create their own Heavenly Dao like Li Muyi.
Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates For example, the Heavenly Dao still wanted to deal with Han Jue. This was not good.
 “I want to know if the Heavenly Dao will be used by me if I control all the providence in the Immortal World?”
 (Ten billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [As long as you control half of the Heavenly Dao’s providence, it will obey you.)
 Han Jue was enlightened.
 No wonder the Dao Ancestor could transcend the Heavenly Dao. Back when the Dao Sect was at its peak, it could be said to be omnipotent. All the Sages were Dao Ancestor’s disciples.
 Having an idea, Han Jue said, “I can accept you and help you, but the power of the Hidden Sect can’t be shown on the surface, understand?”
 Ji Xianshen was pleasantly surprised. He immediately knelt down and said, “Disciple Ji Xianshen greets Master!”
 Han Jue didn’t deny it. The two of them had a close relationship and could be master and disciple.
 “From now on, you’re my ninth disciple. Go back for the time being. Later, I will send someone to support you. Of course, if you encounter trouble, you can come to the Hundred Peak Immortal River at any time,” Han Jue stared at him and said softly.
 Ninth disciple?
 Ji Xianshen was secretly shocked. What kind of monsters were the first eight disciples?
 He asked carefully, “Master, outside the door…”
 “His name is Zhang Jue. He only has Li Muyi’s cultivation and appearance.”
 “Zhang Jue…”
 Ji Xianshen was dumbfounded. He had the cultivation of a Sage?
 What was this!
 Wait!
 He could duplicate the cultivation of a Sage…
 Wasn’t Han Jue…
 Sensing Ji Xianshen’s gaze, Han Jue didn’t hide anything, in case Ji Xianshen was frightened by the other Sages.
 “Yes, I’ve become a Sage. Only the Sages know about this. You can’t tell anyone.”
 “Master…”
 Ji Xianshen landed on the ground outside the Hundred Peak Immortal River, still in a daze.
 He took a deep breath and perked up.
 His lips curled up as he muttered, “So my benefactor had already appeared long ago.” Now that he thought about it, it made sense. If not for Han Jue, he would probably have died under the Heavenly Troops many years ago. If not for Han Jue, he wouldn’t have been promoted by the Heavenly Emperor.
 If not for Han Jue, he wouldn’t have been highly regarded by Fang Liang, much less become the leader of the Heavenly Race.
 Everything came from Han Jue.
 This was his master.
 After Ji Xianshen left, Han Jue continued cultivating.
 He didn’t immediately make arrangements to support the Heavenly Race. There was still time.
 The Hidden Sect’s principles wouldn’t change. They wouldn’t leave the mountain unless they reached the Pseudo-Sage Realm.
 Currently, only Li Daokong could represent the Hidden Sect to go out, but Han Jue was afraid that he would be surrounded. He still had to cultivate for a while.
 In the blink of an eye.
 Two hundred years passed.
 On this day, Han Jue, who was cultivating, suddenly opened his eyes. He looked happy.
 A Fiendcelestial in the Primordial World was successfully born and its intelligence awakened.
 Su Qi!
 Death Fiendcelestial!
 In the Fiendcelestial Qi, Su Qi was curled up into a ball. His form had already condensed to his previous life. He was naked.
 He slowly opened his eyes and looked around in confusion.
 His memories of his life surged like water, and his eyes gradually became clear.
 “Sage Fated Secrets… Dao Destruction Mystical Power…”
 “Why am I still alive?”
