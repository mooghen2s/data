 You’re really a talent.
 The Jie School wasn’t a mortal sect. In just a few thousand years, he had become the vice sect master from an ordinary disciple. It was simply unheard of. No one would believe such a story.
 Han Jue fell silent.
 He suddenly did not want to recall Huang Zuntian.
 If he continued to stay, he might directly control the Jie School.
 Han Jue felt that it was quite beautiful.
 After a moment of silence, he said in a low voice, “If I let you come back now, wouldn’t all my efforts be in vain? Although you’ve suffered all these years, your cultivation has indeed become stronger. Hold on for a while longer. One day, I’ll personally fetch you back.”
 Huang Zuntian’s eyes darkened. However, when he thought of Han Jue personally receiving him, he was immediately excited.
 What he meant was…
 At that time, Han Jue wouldn’t be afraid of the Jie School!
 Han Jue said meaningfully, “Many people who faced the Immeasurable Calamity this time are from the Scarlet Cloud World. You should know about this, right? If your information is powerful, you should know that those who have karma with me have all survived and are doing well.”
 Huang Zuntian was moved. He had been puzzled about this before.
 In that case…
 Huang Zuntian didn’t dare to think about it.
 He suppressed his excitement and asked, “What else do you need me to do?”
 Han Jue said, “Continue what you did previously. I don’t want to assign you a mission. If you have too strong of an intention, it will easily attract trouble. Stay in the Jie School. You only need to be a good disciple and cultivate seriously.”
 Huang Zuntian nodded and couldn’t help but ask, “How much longer do I have to wait?”
 Han Jue thought for a moment and said, “Not long.”
 Huang Zuntian was relieved.
 “You just finished listening to the Dao?” Han Jue asked.
 Huang Zuntian smiled. “You’re really perceptive of the myriad worlds. I can’t hide anything from you.”
 “The Sages of the Jie School treat you very
 well.”
 “I’m ashamed to say this. The Sages preach to the elite disciples. They preach the Great Dao, but I can only comprehend myself and not the Great Dao.”
 Huang Zuntian looked pained.
 This wasn’t the first time he had heard a Sage preach the Dao, but the Great Dao was too profound for him.
 Han Jue smiled and said, “Then, I’ll teach you a Great Dao. How about that?”
 Huang Zuntian was stunned. He stared at him.
 Under the light of the Sun and Moon Yin-Yang Protection, Han Jue was like a god. Huang Zuntian seemed to see a Sage.
 Sages were so high and mighty.
 Since Han Jue could teach him the Great Dao, didn’t that mean…
 Huang Zuntian didn’t dare to continue thinking
 He nodded quickly.
 Han Jue said, “Don’t say that I taught you this Great Dao. Say that you comprehended it by chance, and don’t use it unless you have no choice. Use it only as a cultivation technique to comprehend.”
 “No problem!”
 Huang Zuntian hurriedly agreed.
 Twenty years passed quickly.
 Huang Zuntian opened his eyes as brilliance flashed.
 He looked at his Daoist temple and felt as if a lifetime had passed.
 “What a profound Great Dao. It feels even more unfathomable than the Great Dao of a Sage. Why can he easily teach it to me, when I don’t understand the Dao of a Sage?
 “Could it be that he’s already stronger than a Sage?”
 The moment this thought appeared, it was like weeds growing violently in Huang Zuntian’s mind. It was unstoppable.
 At this moment, the voice of a Jie School disciple came from outside the Daoist temple.
 “Master, the Sage has invited you.”
 Huang Zuntian took a deep breath and immediately stood up. He made up his mind to hide the preaching. As he walked, he used his Mystical Power to erase the memory of Han Jue teaching him the Great Dao.
 At this moment, even he didn’t know where the Great Dao of Extreme Origin came from.
 He could only guess that it was related to Han Jue’s dream.
 In that case, even if a Sage searched his soul, he wouldn’t be able to find Han Jue.
 After returning to the Daoist temple, Han Jue entered his cultivation state again.
 Cultivate!
 Cultivate!
Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com His goal was to become a Sage!
 With the Primordial Chaos Reincarnation Great Dao cultivation technique, the Great Dao of Extreme Origin, and the Stellar Primordial Body, Han Jue did not need to walk the path of providence to attain the Dao or Merit to become a Sage. He could attain the Dao with brute force.
 This method was recorded in the Primordial Chaos Reincarnation Great Dao.
 After all, the Primordial Chaos Reincarnation Great Dao was a Great Dao cultivation technique created by the nine Great Dao fragments!
 The Hidden Sect disciples would occasionally head to the Myriad Worlds Hall to chat. They were clearly very close. Some people liked to chat in the group all the time, causing it to never quiet down.
 Time passed quickly.
 In the blink of an eye.
 A thousand years passed.
 At 11,000 years old, Han Jue didn’t receive a system notification. His heart also sank.
 This meant that there would only be a notification once every ten thousand years. After all, it started once every ten years.
 Would it happen once every million years or once every billion years in the future?
 Han Jue didn’t dare to think too much.
 At that point, he should already be very strong.
 A thousand years later, the entire Hidden Sect, including Fairy Xi Xuan, Chang Yue’er, and ten thousand Nether Race members, had all reached the Immortal Emperor Realm.
 This was related to Han Jue frequently preaching. Every 300 years, he would preach the Dao once, and each time, he would preach for at least 30 years.
 On this day.
 Han Jue called Dao Sovereign, Zhao Xuanyuan, Jiang Yi, Zhou Fan, and Li Yao into the Daoist temple.
 Not long ago, Li Yao had just stepped into the Deity Realm.
 “I’m prepared to teach you the Great Dao,” Han Jue said.
 The five of them lit up.
 Dao Sovereign was the first to ask, “Is it really the Great Dao? I heard that only Sages can teach the Great Dao…”
 Han Jue said, “The Great Dao Inheritance is actually beneficial to the Dao preacher. If you cultivate the Great Dao of the Sages, you will never be able to surpass them. Similarly, it’s the same for cultivating my Great Dao. However, if I’m stronger, your Great Dao will also be stronger. It depends on whether you have confidence in me and whether I can surpass the Heavenly Dao Sages and those high and mighty existences.”
 Zhou Fan snorted. “Definitely. You’re the only person I acknowledge!”
 The other four nodded.
 Until today, they no longer dared to compete with Han Jue. They only had endless admiration for him.
 Every time they entered the simulation trial when they were arrogant and were insta-killed by Han Jue, they knew that they were still far from it.
 They were all very confident that before those Heavenly Dao Sages attained the Dao, their talent might not be stronger than theirs.
 However, Han Jue was different. Even the three Chaotic Physiques couldn’t catch up to him.
 Han Jue’s future achievements were immeasurable.
 “Hurry up and teach it.” Li Yao urged.
 Han Jue smiled and immediately started preaching
 The reason why he could completely impart the Great Dao to others was mainly that he had created the Great Dao of Extreme Origin.
 For example, when Ancestor Xitian taught the Great Dao of Karma, the listeners couldn’t completely comprehend it because Ancestor Xitian wasn’t the Great Dao of Karma’s creator. He was only the first cultivator.
 This preaching ended after nine years. It was mainly because these five people were too talented. In the entire Immortal World, few could compare to them.
 However, the five of them still needed a long time to comprehend the Dao before they could completely master it.
 They had basically obtained a cultivation method and had just started.
 After the preaching ended, Han Jue stood up and walked out of the Daoist temple to the Fusang Tree.
 He walked in front of the spatial vortex and asked, “How’s the situation recently?”
 Ma Chao replied, “Often, living beings approach this cave and even want to barge in, but they are frightened by my aura.”
