 He wasn’t afraid of offending a Sage now. Even if all the Heavenly Dao Sages came, they still wouldn’t be able to break through his Dao Field.
 However, he found it troublesome and kept a low profile.
 Although Han Jue was no longer afraid of the Heavenly Dao Sages, there was still Ancestor Xitian in the Immortal World.
 Although Ancestor Xitian had a favorable impression of him, it was not high. What if Ancestor Xitian suddenly lost his mind and wanted to kill him?
 In order to prevent this situation, Han Jue had to maintain his determination to cultivate diligently.
 He had reached this point because of his cultivation attitude.
 He could relax occasionally, but not always.
 Thirty years later.
 Li Xuan’ao came to visit him.
 He was stunned when he saw Zhang Jue.
 When he came back to his senses, his first reaction was to escape!
 However, he wasn’t an ordinary person and quickly sensed that something was wrong.
 How could a Sage come here?
 He was even guarding the door?
 As for the possibility of Han Jue being killed by Li Muyi, it was just that Li Xuan’ao felt that Han Jue was stronger than the other party.
 Han Jue’s voice floated over. “What is it?”
 Coming back to his senses, Li Xuan’ao couldn’t help but ask, “Sect Master, why is my master… Sage here?”
 Zhang Jue opened his eyes and glanced at him before quickly closing them again.
 “It’s just my Mystical Power. He has your master’s appearance and cultivation level, but he’s not your master. His name is Zhang Jue.”
 Li Xuan’ao widened his eyes.
 Only the same appearance and cultivation?
 What kind of Mystical Power was this?
 It was unheard of!
 Li Xuan’ao suddenly felt that he had underestimated Han Jue. He could even duplicate the cultivation of a Sage…
 “If there’s nothing, leave.”
 Han Jue’s words interrupted his thoughts. Li Xuan’ao hurriedly said, “Sect Master, the Long-arm Ape is now very capable. I think we can let him out and teach the Long-arm Ape Race to develop hidden forces for the Hidden Sect.”
 He had already said this opportunity before. Han Jue thought for a moment and said, “Alright, I’ll send him out directly.”
 “Thank you, Sect Master. He’s already prepared.”
 “Mm.”
 Han Jue moved the Long-arm Ape out of the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 After landing, the Long-arm Ape was not surprised. It was just a little reluctant.
 It actually liked living in the Hundred Peak Immortal River, but Li Xuan’ao had given it a mission.
 “If you encounter this person in the future, acknowledge him as your master.”
 Han Jue’s voice floated into the Long-arm Ape’s ears. Then, Han Tuo’s face appeared in his mind.
 The Long-arm Ape was stunned. He was extremely familiar with Han Jue’s voice. Not to mention him, the entire Hidden Sect was the same. It was precisely because this voice often preached the Dao that their cultivation speed was unstoppable.
 The Long-arm Ape couldn’t help but ask, “He is…”
 “Don’t ask. I personally gave you this mission. After it’s done, I won’t mistreat you. Don’t tell the Second Guardian, either,” Han Jue shouted, almost scaring the Long-arm Ape away.
 The Long-arm Ape did not dare to ask and could only nod in fear.
 “Go. I’ll watch you.”
 The Long-arm Ape took a deep breath, adjusted its emotions, and flew into the distance.
 On that day.
 Li Daokong came to Han Jue’s Daoist temple. He sized up Zhang Jue in shock and was silent.
 In the end, he didn’t disturb Han Jue and left without saying anything.
 No one knew how shocked Li Daokong and Li Xuan’ao were by Zhang Jue’s appearance.
 Han Jue noticed Li Daokong’s arrival. Since he had nothing to do, he started to check his emails.

 Han Jue was stunned when he saw the Primordial Chaos Heavenly Devil.
 This fellow finally moved!
 Although the portrait was still there, Han Jue didn’t see any movement from him, as if he was in a deep sleep.
 [Primordial Chaos Heavenly Devil: Early-stage Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm, from the Chaotic Forbidden Zone. The Devil Race of the Ancient Era was defeated in the Immeasurable Calamity. The Devil Race was expelled from the Heavenly Dao. Later, in another Immeasurable Calamity, they were summoned by the Buddhist Sect. The Primordial Chaos Heavenly Devil is connected to the White-Robed Buddha’s Devil Heart. After separating from the White-Robed Buddha, the Primordial Chaos Heavenly Devil followed your instructions and returned to the Buddhist Sect. He has been thinking of you. Current favorability: 6 stars]
 The Primordial Chaos Heavenly Devil had become a Buddha at this moment. Could it be related to the invasion of the Heavenly Devils?
 Since the favorability of the Primordial Chaos Heavenly Devil didn’t change, Han Jue was not worried.
 It just so happened that he could use the Primordial Chaos Heavenly Devil to spy on the Buddhist Sect.
Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates Han Jue also noticed that Ji Xianshen’s Dao heart was transforming. Was this fellow turning to the dark side?
 As for Ancestor Xitian, who was he discussing the Dao with?
 Where?
 Outside the 33rd Heaven, or the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End?
 Empress Houtu had already surpassed the Heavenly Dao, yet she could still be attacked by an Inauspicious Evil?
 Han Jue felt that his circle of friends had expanded greatly.
 After reading the emails, he sent a dream to Ji Xianshen.
 Han Jue still had a good impression of him. The two of them came from the same mortal world and had even fought against the Immortal Gods together, although Ji Xianshen had performed terribly.
 After so many years, the calamity had ended. Ji Xianshen still missed their feelings. In the previous Heavenly Race Banquet, he had taken care of the Hidden Sect.
 Han Jue didn’t want him to walk the path of no return.
 The dream space was a forest outside the Jade Pure Sacred Sect from a long time ago.
 Ji Xianshen was stunned when he saw him.
 Han Jue was covered by the divine light of the Sun and Moon Yin-Yang Protection, but Ji Xianshen immediately recognized him.
 “You’re here,” Ji Xianshen said with a complicated expression.
 He had always wanted to surpass Han Jue, but no matter how hard he tried, the difference between them kept increasing.
 Although it had been many years, the strength displayed by the Hidden Sect made him not dare to underestimate Han Jue.
 This fellow was probably already a Pseudo-Sage!
 Han Jue asked, “How have you been feeling recently? Do you need my help?”
 Ji Xianshen was stunned. He asked in surprise, “Why do I need your help?”
 “No?”
 IIII
 Ji Xianshen was silent.
 Han Jue wasn’t in a hurry.
 After a long while…
 Ji Xianshen took a deep breath and said, “I indeed need your help. I just don’t know if you can help me.”
 Han Jue said, “Go ahead.”
 Ji Xianshen said, “To be honest, in order to become stronger, I fused with the remnant body of a Pseudo-Sage in the calamity. Although my cultivation level has increased greatly, there are mental demons everywhere. Now, it causes me to be unable to cultivate in peace. If this continues, I’m afraid I’ll lose my mind and even become another person.”
 He paused for a moment and then continued, “I suspect that I’m being targeted by a Sage. The reason why I fused with the remnant body of a Pseudo-Sage was because of a technique given by a Sage. At that time, the Sage promised that nothing would happen to me…”
 Speaking of this, Ji Xianshen became angry.
 “There’s always a voice in my mind. He’s shouting a name.
 “Primordial Fiendcelestial!”
