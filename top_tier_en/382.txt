 Han Jue thought as a black vortex appeared behind him.
 After this ended, he had to upgrade the Invocation Technique so that he did not have to deduce it every time.
 [Ten thousand years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?)
 Continue!
 Ten thousand years was simply looking down on him!
 A name appeared in front of Han Jue.
 [Xing Hongxuan]
 This woman…
 Han Jue was speechless and heaved a sigh of relief. As long as it was not Long Hao.
 After hesitating for a moment, he still stepped into the black vortex.
 The next second, Han Jue passed through the black vortex and came to a magnificent palace. All kinds of paintings and jade artifacts were arranged. A refreshing fragrance filled the hall.
 Han Jue saw Xing Hongxuan sitting in front of the table, which was covered in fine wine and food.
 Han Jue couldn’t help but remain silent.
 Xing Hongxuan smiled and said, “Husband, come and sit!”
 “Sit for what? I taught you the Mystical Power, and this is how you use it?”
 “Oh, come on.”
 Xing Hongxuan took the initiative to walk over and pulled him over.
 Han Jue was helpless. This was a treacherous plot.
 After sitting down, the two of them exchanged drinks. The atmosphere gradually changed.
 In less than five minutes, Han Jue’s robe was removed.
 A month later.
 A male voice came from outside the palace, “Saintess, an Immortal Emperor is preaching in the Holy City today. I have an invitation. Do you want to go?”
 Xing Hongxuan sat on Han Jue’s lap and replied, “No, I’m in seclusion recently.”
 “This Immortal Emperor is not simple…”
 “No means no!”
 “Alright, continue cultivating. If you come out of seclusion, you can look for me anytime.”
 “Mm.”
 After the man outside the hall left, Han Jue asked, “Who is he?”
 This palace had a special restriction. The people outside couldn’t sense anything inside. Xing Hongxuan said disdainfully, “In my husband’s words, an ugly frog who wants to eat swan meat. “Ignore him. Let’s continue.”
 “Oh? You’ve not had enough?”
 “It’s not enough, it’s never enough!”
 …
 After returning to the Connate Cave Abode, Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief.
 If not for him reaching the Deity Realm and closing the Invocation Technique, he would have had to cross the heavens and fly back to the Nine Nether Purgatory. Now, he could directly open the way back. He had the Six Paths Insignia in the Connate Cave Abode and could find the spatial node.
 Han Jue shook his head and laughed. This woman always treated him differently.
 After a few months, he could finally relax.
 Han Jue began to study the Invocation Technique.
 Two years later.
 With his comprehension ability at the Deity Realm, Han Jue raised the Invocation Technique’s level. From now on, he could feel who was summoning him.
 He had already warned Xing Hongxuan not to summon him whenever she was free!
 After her pestering, Han Jue allowed her to summon him once every hundred years. After raising his cultivation level to the Deity Realm, Han Jue felt that he could use the Dark Nightmare again.
 This time, he wanted to visit Xue Minghe in his dreams.
 When Xue Minghe left the Nine Nether Purgatory, it happened to be near Hidden Sect Island. Han Jue copied his data and knew his face, which made it convenient for him to make the other party dream.
 After a while.
 He had succeeded!
 Han Jue forcefully created a dream realm for Xue Minghe and pulled him into it.
 This was a dark world filled with volcanoes. Han Jue transformed into the Dark Forbidden Lord, ghastly and terrifying.
 After Xue Minghe opened his eyes, he was frightened when he saw Han Jue. However, he immediately seemed to realize something and asked carefully, “Are you the Dark Forbidden Lord?”
 Xue Minghe could sense that he could directly jump out of the dream realm, but the other party could forcefully drag him inside, which meant that the other party was stronger than him. The strength of the dream realm could only mean that the other party was expressing goodwill.
 This image…
 The first name that appeared in Xue Minghe’s mind was Dark Forbidden Lord.
 Han Jue asked calmly, “Do you feel comfortable using my name?”.
 When Xue Minghe heard that, he felt as if he was struck by lightning. He knelt down in fear and cupped his fists. “Senior, the Darkness Sect and I really respect you and are willing to serve you!”
 Han Jue asked, “You have the Asura Race. Why do you want to serve me?”
 Xue Minghe said in shame, “To be honest, the Asura Race is inherited from the Blood Sea Asura of the Ancient Era. We’re a race that the Heavenly Dao doesn’t like. I’ve been looking for a chance to break through. I hope you can allow us to serve you!
 “From now on, the Asura Race will be at your disposal. Our expectations are not high. We only hope that you can protect us.” Han Jue said, “Your Asura Race has survived until now. Don’t you have a way to deal with the calamity?”
 Xue Minghe smiled bitterly. “We have, but we’re born with negative karma. The Heavenly Dao is suppressing us more and more. You’re secretly manipulating the calamity because you fear the Heavenly Dao. We’re on the same
 path.”
 Han Jue was silent and didn’t reply.
 Xue Minghe’s heart skipped a beat. Had he said something wrong?
 Han Jue stared at Xue Minghe quietly. His strange purple eyes made the latter feel weak, and he hurriedly lowered his head.
 The world fell silent.
 After a long while…
 When Xue Minghe was about to collapse, Han Jue said faintly, “I heard that you worked with the Heavenly Court. Actually, I’m not related to the Heavenly Court. The reason why I don’t curse them is that they are an important pawn of mine.”
 Xue Minghe looked up at Han Jue in surprise.
 “To destroy an overlord, one must first make them arrogant.”
 Xue Minghe was enlightened.
 He asked carefully, “Is your final goal to destroy the Heavenly Court? Or to reshuffle the Heavenly Dao forces?”
 Han Jue said, “For myself.”
 For himself!
 Xue Minghe immediately let his imagination run wild.
 This answer was also the easiest to believe.
 If not for him, what benefits would there be in controlling the calamity?
 Does he want to become a Sage?
 (Xue Minghe has a favorable impression of you. Current favorability: 4 stars]
 Han Jue said, “Continue to help the Heavenly Court. Now that a Sage has interfered in the calamity, the true colossus has yet to surface. You can attach yourself to the Heavenly Court and protect yourself first. Wait and see.”
 A Sage was interfering?
 Xue Minghe’s eyes widened as he broke out in cold sweat.
 He thought of those ancient legends.
 Any calamity that Sages participated in would destroy the world. Even the Immortal World would find it difficult to protect itself.
 (Xue Minghe’s favorability towards you has increased. Current favorability: 4.5 stars]
 Xue Minghe said respectfully, “This subordinate understands!” His attitude changed quickly. Han Jue waved his hand and the dream shattered.
 Xue Minghe returned to reality and sighed as he recalled everything.
 Was this the Dark Forbidden Lord?
 It was indeed unfathomable!
 In the Connate Cave Abode, Han Jue wondered if there was anyone else he could use.
 Apart from Xue Minghe, he didn’t know who else worshiped the Dark Forbidden Lord.

 That’s all for now.
 Han Jue perked up and continued cultivating.
 Recently, because of Xing Hongxuan, he had lost a lot of cultivation time. He had to make up for it.
 Han Jue’s absorption speed of negative karma had been steadily increasing. He wasn’t far from the Four Mystic Divine Origin now. At least, he could see signs of it.
 Time flew.
 Thirty years later.
 Liu Bei returned faster than Han Jue had expected.
 Liu Bei smiled and said, “Master, I’ve found the place you’re looking for! It’s even better than the Nine Nether Purgatory!”
