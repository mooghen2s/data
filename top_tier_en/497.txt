 He moved the entire Human Race several regions away from the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 Zhou Fan was stunned when he saw this. Then, he heaved a sigh of relief.
 When he heard that the Human Race might be extinct, he instinctively felt pity. In the end, the Human Race was moved away. He suddenly woke up.
 How could the Human Race be destroyed so easily!
 Many disciples in the Hidden Sect were from the Human Race!
 At the same time, he was shocked by Han Jue’s cultivation.
 His divine sense could no longer capture the humans. Han Jue blew them away in a single breath. Such ability was unimaginable.
 Inside the Daoist temple.
DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com Han Jue looked impatient.
 “They only know how to talk. They aren’t ever satisfied!” Han Jue muttered to himself. No matter if the Human Race was really in danger or if it was the arrangement of the Buddhist Sect, Han Jue couldn’t be bothered to pursue it and directly sent them away!
 In the past few years, the humans had been building cities crazily and had almost completely surrounded the Hundred Peak Immortal River. This was not a coincidence. Unfortunately, they had overestimated themselves.
 In front of absolute power, any schemes were a joke!
 Han Jue probed the ground with his divine sense. Of the thousand Qilin eggs, 90% had already hatched. Not bad.
 At this period, the longer Connate lifeforms were nurtured, the greater their physical potential.
 Of course, it was only the physical potential.
 At Han Jue’s level, physical potential was no longer important. He cared more about comprehension.
 Li Yao’s physical potential was not top-notch, but her comprehension was extremely strong. This was also the reason why she could chase after the top-notch disciples of the Hidden Sect.
 At this moment.
 Li Daokong suddenly came to visit him.
 Han Jue smiled and asked, “Why are you here?”
 After Li Daokong and Li Xuan’ao joined the Hidden Sect, they had been very well-behaved. It was better than Han Jue had expected.
 Especially Li Xuan’ao, who even took the initiative to befriend other disciples.
 After interacting with them for so many years, Han Jue had already completely accepted them.
 Li Daokong asked, “Sect Master, may I ask what status we have in the Hidden Sect?”
 Han Jue said in a low voice, “From today onwards, you will be the Hidden Sect guardians. Your status will be equivalent to second-generation disciples. You will be the first guardian, and Li Xuan’ao will be the second. How about that?”
 Li Daokong smiled. “Thank you, Sect Master!”
 He didn’t dare to think of sitting on the same level as Han Jue. Now that his mentality had changed, in his heart, Han Jue was even higher than the Heavenly Dao Sage!
 Li Daokong didn’t stay any longer. He bowed and left.
 Han Jue thought for a moment and called Jiang Yi in.
 “From today onwards, you are a guardian of the Hidden Sect. Your status is equivalent to a second-generation disciple.”
 Sed
 Jiang Yi was pleasantly surprised. He asked, “Am I the only guardian?”
 “You’re the third guardian. You’re ranked behind Li Daokong and Li Xuan’ao.”
 “Huh?”
 Jiang Yi’s smile instantly collapsed. However, on second thought, it was not nice to let him be in front of Li Daokong. He wasn’t Li Daokong’s match at all.
 Just like that, Jiang Yi became the third guardian.
 He spread this news smugly.
 The Three Guardians sounded stronger than the Four Disciples!
 Regarding this, the disciples of the Hidden Sect were envious and jealous. Guardians sounded stronger than disciples. After Li Daokong, Li Xuan’ao, and Jiang Yi became Guardians, the entire Hidden Sect felt even more condensed.
 The previous Hidden Sect was too loosely defined. In the past few years, Han Jue had gradually confirmed the identities of the people he knew, as if he was sending a signal.
 The Hidden Sect was getting serious!
 Rules were set in place!
 After the humans were moved away, the Hundred Peak Immortal River regained its calm. After witnessing Han Jue’s power, the disciples cultivated even harder. They yearned for the ability to move mountains and seas.
 Time passed.
 Another thousand years passed.
 Ie
 Han Jue’s cultivation level increased again. He was getting closer and closer to the perfected Pseudo-Sage Realm.
 What he saw was not the perfected Pseudo-Sage Realm, but the Sage Realm!
 The Sage Realm was the starting point!
 On this day.
 The ground and the mountains shook as it approached again. It was not a phenomenon, but a battle between powerful figures in the distance.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and discovered that two Zenith Heavens were fighting. One of them was a Buddha and the other had the aura of a god, but it was not completely similar to the aura of an Immortal God. It should be someone from the Heavenly Race.
 The battle between Buddha and Heaven was extremely powerful. Both sides wanted to kill the other.
 Han Jue wasn’t interested after taking a look.
 Weaklings were fighting.
 However, from the looks of it, the Buddhist Sect had begun to fight with the Heavenly Race, probably to fight for the position of Heavenly Dao Sage.
 It was fine as long as it didn’t threaten Han Jue.
 [Emperor Xiao sent you a dream. Do you accept?)
 Emperor Xiao?
 A Sage of the Devil Race?
 Han Jue didn’t want to participate and decided to ignore it.
 Several days later, Emperor Xiao sent him another dream. Han Jue continued to ignore
 The cycle repeated. Five months passed. Emperor Xiao sent him dreams seven times.
 The battle between the Zenith Heavens finally ended. Both sides were injured and no one died. They were lonely.
 [Emperor Xiao sent you a dream. Do you accept?]
 Again!
 Han Jue frowned and asked secretly, “Is it dangerous to accept the dream?”
 (4 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [Not for the time being.]
 Han Jue chose to accept the dream.
 In the dream, Han Jue saw Emperor Xiao. This place seemed to be chaotic. Gray mist surged continuously. Emperor Xiao wore a black robe and looked like the Dark Forbidden Lord.
 Han Jue asked warily, “Dark Forbidden Lord?”
 Emperor Xiao frowned. “What Dark Forbidden Lord? I’m a Sage. It’s an urgent matter, so I’m visiting you in your dreams!”
 Han Jue bowed in fear and cupped his hands. “Greetings, Sage.” “Do any Sage want you to compete to become a Heavenly Dao Sage?”
 “Yes!”
 “It’s all fake. Nüwa’s Primordial Purple Qi is missing. The Sages want to support a Pseudo-Sage and share their Sage providence with the candidates to help them become a Sage on the surface. They actually want to use them to execute the Dao Destruction Mystical Power.”
 Emperor Xiao began to explain to Han Jue what the Dao Destruction Mystical Power was.
 The more Han Jue listened, the more he frowned.
 Sages were really ruthless!
 They actually wanted to use the Dao Destruction Mystical Power!
 It turned out that in the previous calamity, other than the Heavenly Race, the other providence sects had suffered heavy losses. When Su Qi used the Dao Destruction Mystical Power, their disciples did not leave and were still in the Immortal World. In the end, most of the disciples died.
 After the calamity ended, the Dao Sect Sages secretly held their breaths and wanted to take revenge.
 Han Jue found it strange. Shouldn’t Sages take revenge on Sage Fated Secrets?
 Emperor Xiao said, “You’re a variable that the Dao Ancestor has determined. If the Heavenly Dao faces danger, you might have to reverse the situation.”
 Han Jue said fearfully, “I don’t have the ability.”
 Emperor Xiao said impatiently, “I’ve already said what needs to be said. That’s all.”
 He waved his hand and the dream shattered.
 Han Jue’s consciousness returned to his body.
 “Is Emperor Xiao lying to me?”
 (4 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?] Continue!
 [No]
 Huh?
 Han Jue was stunned.
 The Sage of the Devil Race was stopping the Sages of the Dao Sect from destroying the world?
 Did he take the wrong script?
 Wait!
 The Dao Ancestor actually did not destroy the devils and even let them become Sages. Could there be something else involved?
 From Han Jue’s understanding, the Heavenly Dao Sages might not be all good. They were all working for their own ends and plotting against the heavens. From this point of view, they might not be as noble and kind as Emperor Xiao.
