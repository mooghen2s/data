 Not bad!
 Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief.
 He suddenly thought of another question and asked again, “If I use the Book of Misfortune to curse others, will it also strengthen the Curse Fiendcelestial?”
 If that was the case, wouldn’t the Book of Misfortune be useless?
 (No]
 Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief. If not for the Book of Misfortune, he wouldn’t have been able to kill those powerful enemies that far exceeded him. Han Jue immediately made his choice.
 (You choose to cultivate in a low-profile manner and stay away from the Curse Fiendcelestial. You will obtain a Great Dao fragment and a Heavenly Dao Spirit Stone.) He took out the Book of Misfortune and the Heavenly Dao Spirit Stone and started to fuse them.
 Several months later.
 The Book of Misfortune was successfully upgraded. It transformed from a Freedom Numinous Treasure to a Freedom Supreme Treasure. After successfully upgrading the Dharma treasure, Han Jue entered cultivation.
 Next, he wanted to break through to the mid-stage of the Freedom Primordial Chaos Realm.
 The birth of the Curse Fiendcelestial did not affect the Immortal World. Ever since the Sages discussed about Cundi’s death, the various Sage Sects began to take action.
 The Sage Sects each sent disciples to the various mortal worlds to teach Dao techniques. Not only was the Immortal World developing rapidly, but the mortal worlds were also the same. The Chaotic Cities of the Immortal World began to recruit living beings to search the nearby Dark Forbidden Zone and create a teleportation formation to help the Immortal World expand.
 For a time, the entire Heavenly Dao fell into a busy state. The Sages did not stop and continued preaching More and more Zenith Heaven Golden Immortals appeared. In addition to the existence of the Heavenly Dao Providence Board, their reputation spread very quickly. Five thousand years passed in a flash. Han Jue’s seclusion ended and he began to preach the Dao to the Hidden Sect disciples. The Great Dao of Extreme Origin covered the Hundred Peak Immortal River while his gaze looked at the Immortal World.
 Han Yu had just reached the Deity Realm not long ago. He was now one of the ten great War Gods of the Human Race. His providence was connected to the Human Race.
 Ever since Li Daokong became a Sage, the providence of the Human Race had increased steadily. They had already entered the strongest ten races in the Immortal World. After the demons dispersed, the Immortal World became peaceful. The various races were busy cultivating and had no time to fight for territory. The Sages had always been preaching a philosophy that the Immortal World would become larger and larger. There was no point in fighting for territory now. Han Jue didn’t expect much from Han Yu, but he still looked forward to his development. If Han Yu could become one of the prodigies of the Immortal World, Han Jue would naturally be happy. Unfortunately. If Han Yu was tied down by the humans, they might tie him down in the future, preventing him from doing whatever he wanted. Han Jue turned his gaze to the netherworld. The netherworld was also developing. From time to time, Empress Houtu would preach the Dao to the Ghost Deities and build a Chaotic City at the end of the Yellow Spring. It was said that the end of the Yellow Spring was the weakest point of the Heavenly Dao. If the enemy wanted to invade the Heavenly Dao, the netherworld would definitely be the best place to attack. In addition, ever since the Dark Sage King died, the Immortal World’s Reincarnation Mystic Realm had been sealed by the Sages. The entrance was guarded by Pseudo-Sages all year round, and no living beings were allowed to approach. Everything was on track! Han Jue smiled in satisfaction and started to check his emails.
 Even someone as strong as Ancestor Xitian was still being attacked by the Inauspicious Evil, mysterious Dao Devils, and mysterious mighty figures. It was truly tragic. Indeed, only the Heavenly Dao was the safest. Han Jue thought silently. (The Curse Fiendcelestial has developed hatred towards you. Current Hatred Points: 6.5 stars] This notification appeared in front of him, indicating that the intelligence of the Cursed Fiendcelestial had already been born.
 Han Jue didn’t care.
 A hundred years later, the lecture ended and he continued cultivating. Five hundred years later, he finally had the chance to break through!
 Han Jue began to break through in seclusion.
 Unknowingly, Han Jue was already 160,000 years old.
 He could be called an ancient existence by all living beings. Han Jue sighed as he consolidated his cultivation. At the same time. Outside the Immortal World, towards the north, a majestic sea of fire attacked from the darkness. The sea of flames was unknown. In the torrential flames, figures emitting a terrifying aura stepped on the flames.
 In the lead was a burly figure that was a million feet tall. He wore purple-black heavy armor and held a spear that was longer than his body in each of his four arms. His waist was surrounded by fire dragons that constantly breathed out, looking sinister and terrifying. “Children of the Flame Race, the Heavenly Dao is ahead! As long as we break through the Heavenly Dao, the Flame Race won’t have to hide anymore!” The million-foot-long figure roared angrily. His voice alerted the Chaotic City at the edge of the Immortal World. Before he could finish speaking, the billions of Flame Race living beings swept over like a wave. The Chaotic City was shocked. They gathered the disciples of the various sects to prepare for battle.
 A world-shattering battle erupted! Outside the 33rd Heaven, the South Extreme Heavenly Venerate walked out of his Dao Field. He waved his right hand and wanted to cast a spell to directly destroy the Flame Race, but his expression changed. The moment his Dharmic powers left the Heavenly Dao, they were negated by a domineering force. An existence beyond the Sages was lurking in the dark! “Hmph, don’t interfere in battles below the Sage Realm.”
 A cold voice sounded, causing the South Extreme Heavenly Venerate’s face to turn ashen. At this moment, a sword Qi shot out from the Universal Hall and vanished into the darkness. “You don’t know your limits!” The cold voice sounded again. Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du’s sword Qi dissipated as soon as it left the Heavenly Dao.
ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels Soon.
 The Sages gathered in the Universal Hall.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du’s expression was dark. “That person just now is called Undying Dao. He was a powerful existence at the same time as the Dao Ancestor and is already on par with the Great Dao. You can’t defeat him.” The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate frowned. “I’ve already ordered the Jie School to resist the Flame Race. However, the Flame Race is very strong. They have more than ten Pseudo-Sages and more than a thousand Zenith Heaven Golden Immortals. Damn it, where did this Flame Race come from?”
 Heavenly Venerate Wufa said, “The Chaos is endless. There are also powerful races hidden. The reason why Undying Dao appeared was to stop the Sages from interfering and facilitate the invasion of the Flame Race. The Heavenly Dao can only isolate existences above the Sages. The Flame Race has no Sages. As long as they break through the defense line, they can enter the Heavenly Dao. If they slaughter all the living beings in the Heavenly Dao and abandon the Heavenly Dao’s providence, the Heavenly Dao will die!”.
 “Everyone, give the order to be on guard. Other than the battle with the Flame Race, the other Chaotic Cities have to increase their manpower.” “Understood!”
 The Sages sent voice transmissions. Emperor Xiao asked, “Should we ask Han Jue to help?” Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “Undying Dao is an existence that far exceeds the Dark Sage King. If Fellow Daoist Han is confident, he will naturally attack. In the previous Heavenly Devil Calamity, Dao Heavenly Devil came from Undying Dao’s subordinate. His hatred for the Heavenly Dao is deeply rooted. He has always felt that he is stronger than the Dao Ancestor, but the Heavenly Dao did not choose him.” The other Sages frowned. Shi Dudao muttered, “Perhaps I shouldn’t have attained the Dao so early.” He was confident in his strength and was invincible among those of the same realm; even Li Daokong was not his match. But he could only be a spectator now.
