 How righteous!
 In the past, the Sages had always declared what they wanted to do in the Heavenly Dao. The Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage had directly raised his target to outside the Heavenly Dao.
 How could the competition for power in the world compare to the power to expand one’s territory!
 However, did the Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage really think so?
 Han Jue felt that it was impossible.
 The Deity Realm of the Ruins of End couldn’t send out only fence-sitters twice. It was already ridiculous for a Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du to appear. The Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage would definitely destroy the Heavenly Dao and at least restrain its development.
 In that case, his declaration was only to rope in more living beings to join the demons and form a greater momentum.
 “I am the Human School’s Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du. The demons are no longer part of the Heavenly Dao Race. Struggling at death’s door will only hinder the development of the Heavenly Dao. From today onwards, the demons will be eliminated. If you see demons, all living beings can eliminate them!”
 “I am Fang Liang of the Heavenly Dao Sect. The Heavenly Dao Sect feels that the demons are an obstacle to the development of the Heavenly Dao and must be eradicated. The demons will immediately leave. Those who ignore the Heavenly Dao Sect will be punished by the Heavenly Dao, and the cycle of reincarnation will not tolerate it!”
 “I am the South Extreme Heavenly Venerate of the Chan School…”
 “I am Sect Master Tian Jue of the Jie School…”
 “I am Qiu Xilai of the Buddhist Sect…”
 The five Sages spoke one after another, forcefully challenging the Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage. All living beings were in an uproar.
 The demons were still celebrating just now. With the backing of a Sage, they would definitely rise in the future. In the end, five Sages wanted to eradicate them.
 They were all in despair.
 How could a Sage defeat five Sages?
 Han Jue’s impression of Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du and the other Sages changed. This shouldn’t be a self-directed act. It seemed that Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du really wanted to protect the Heavenly Dao.
 He looked up at the 33rd Heaven. There was no battle. It was silent and strange.
 It was impossible for the Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage to remain indifferent.
 Han Jue began to look forward to their battle.
 In the area of the Heavenly Dao, it was impossible for the Heavenly Dao Sages to be killed. The Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage couldn’t do anything to the Sages and would probably use the mighty figures in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End.
 With the Sages’ powerful declarations, the situation in the Immortal World changed. The demons were the most affected. Many races who had joined them left. For a time, the demons seemed to collapse.
 Jie School, in the Sect Master’s Daoist temple.
 Huang Zuntian slowly put down the jade in his hand. Sect Master Tian Jue had already given him an order to eliminate the demons at all costs.
 “Why is the battle between Sages so obvious?” Huang Zuntian found it strange.
 In the past, Sages had always been plotting in secret. Unlike this time, they were all angry on the surface.
 Huang Zuntian had a feeling that something big was about to happen.
 He fell into deep thought.
 He wanted to contact Han Jue and understand the truth. Otherwise, if he rashly targeted the demons, Sect Master Tian Jue could withstand it, but he couldn’t.
 The current demons had the backing of a Sage. The Sage couldn’t kill Sect Master Tian Jue, but killing him was as easy as flipping his palm.
 Huang Zuntian felt a headache.
 He still wanted to cultivate well and increase his cultivation level.
 Huang Zuntian thought for a moment and still ordered the disciples to besiege the demons, but it could not be too big.
 As for contacting Han Jue, he couldn’t for the time being. If Han Jue needed it, he would definitely take the initiative to contact him. If he contacted him now, it might let the unknown enemy find a flaw.
 At the same time, the forces supported by the five Sages began to issue orders to besiege the demons.
 This matter couldn’t be delayed. If it dragged on, the demons would think that the Sages were just playing around.
 The demons’ true end had just begun.
 In the blink of an eye, another thousand years passed.
 Han Jue opened his eyes.
𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com He glanced at Great Loose Heaven in the corner of the Daoist temple.
 He was slightly satisfied.
 Great Loose Heaven’s cultivation will was still very strong. Ever since he arranged the things in the sect, he had come to the Hundred Peak Immortal River to cultivate in peace. All these years, without Han Jue saying anything, he wouldn’t disturb him.
 Han Jue checked the emails.
 (Your good friend Emperor Xiao was cursed by a mysterious curse.]
 [Your good friend Yang Du has entered the Dark Forbidden Zone.)
 (Your good friend Evil Heavenly Emperor has transformed into darkness and was enlightened by a mysterious mighty figure.)
 [Your good friend Shi Dudao was attacked by your good friend Li Daokong.]
 (Your good friend Ancestor Xitian was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure] x129
 (Your good friend Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial has comprehended a Mystical Power. His cultivation has increased greatly.)
 (Your good friend Fang Liang has stepped into the River of Time. His soul has passed through the primordial era.)
 [Your good friend Ancestor Xitian was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure and was severely injured.)
 The ancestor was injured!
 Han Jue was shocked.
 Ancestor Xitian was a Transcendent Dao Expert. Even now, Han Jue couldn’t hurt him at all in the simulation trial.
 Han Jue silently used the derivation function to ask who had severely injured Ancestor Xitian.
 [Karma Heaven: Great Dao Divine Spirit, formed by the Great Dao of Karma. Later, it was controlled by Ancestor Xitian and was deprived of the Great Dao Origin. Therefore, it hates the Heavenly Dao. Because you stopped its plan to destroy the Heavenly Dao, it has developed hatred towards you. Current Hatred Points: 4 stars]
 It was him!
 Han Jue mourned for Ancestor Xitian.
 Being targeted by a mortal enemy was probably not as simple as being severely injured.
 Han Jue couldn’t help but think of Dijun, Jade Bodhi, and Seven Dao Sage. Thinking about it, the four of them had a favorable impression of him. They must have a good relationship. He didn’t expect them to stab Ancestor Xitian in the back.
 Ancestor Xitian’s tragedy strengthened Han Jue’s determination not to leave the Heavenly Dao.
 He looked at Great Loose Heaven and said, “Cultivate outside the Daoist temple and explore the Hundred Peak Immortal River.”
 Hearing this, Great Loose Heaven opened his eyes and bowed before leaving.
 He was also very curious about the Hundred Peak Immortal River, but Han Jue’s Daoist temple isolated his divine sense and he couldn’t spy on it.
 After Great Loose Heaven left, Han Jue took out the Book of Misfortune.
 He prepared to reinforce Ancestor Xitian. Coincidentally, Karma Heaven wanted to kill him.
 It would be great if Ancestor Xitian and Karma Heaven were still fighting.
 Five days later.
 Han Jue’s lifespan began to decrease. He opened his attributes panel and emails and stared at them.
 10 billion years!
 100 billion years!
 A trillion years!
 10 trillion years!
 Han Jue’s mentality was still considered calm. Perhaps he had gotten arrogant. As long as he didn’t spend more than a quadrillion years of his lifespan, it felt fine.
 His lifespan continued to decrease!
 500 trillion years!
 600 trillion years!
 [Because of your curse, your enemy Karma Heaven’s Dao heart has wavered.)
 (Your enemy, Karma Heaven, was attacked by your good friend Ancestor Xitian and was severely injured.]
 Han Jue immediately stopped.
 He sighed silently. “Ancestor, I’ve returned the favor of your preaching back then.”
 After resting for a few days, Han Jue started cursing Cundi.
 He would curse based on his Hatred Points. The higher the Hatred Points, the more he would curse first. There was no need to curse anyone below three stars.
 A month later.
 Han Jue gave Cundi and the Chaotic Deity a quadrillion years of lifespan each. The two mighty figures were cursed until their Dao hearts were damaged.
 Han Jue had an octillion years of lifespan. He didn’t even spend a significant number now.
 He suddenly had a bold thought.
 Should he take out ten quadrillion years to play?
 Even if he couldn’t curse the Chaotic Deity to death, he could at least severely injure him.
 The moment this thought appeared, Han Jue’s heart started to beat faster.
 Try!
 The Chaotic Deity had 6.5 stars of hatred towards him. The earlier he got rid of him, the better!
 Han Jue adjusted his condition for a few days and took out the Book of Misfortune again.
