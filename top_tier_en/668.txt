 Even more afraid now, Han Tuo asked curiously, “Is he stronger than the Dao Ancestor?” The Evil Heavenly Emperor replied, “I’m not sure. That existence is not something I can assess. Don’t think about it usually. Whatever you can think of, he can learn of it.”
 Han Tuo nodded and became even more nervous. It could even spy on thoughts. It was too terrifying “You can return to the Immortal World to take a look when you’re free. If I’m not wrong, you should have a younger brother or sister soon,” the Evil Heavenly Emperor said. Han Tuo nodded, feeling complicated. To be able to resonate with his bloodline, how strong was his potential?
 Han Jue didn’t know that his youngest son had caused such a huge commotion. He was still focused on cultivating. Another four thousand years passed. Han Jue was finally close to breaking through. He was in a good mood. After his seclusion, he preached the Dao to the Hidden Sect disciples for a hundred years.
 Not long after the lecture ended, Li Xuan’ao and Han Zuitian came to visit. As the first living being to transform in the Hundred Peak Immortal River, Han Zuitian was already Li Xuan’ao’s right-hand man. They managed the affairs of the Hundred Peak Immortal River together.
 Han Jue let them in and the two of them knelt down.
 Han Zuitian began to report the situation in the sect.
 Ten thousand Nether Race members were still stuck at the Six Mystic Divine Origin. Even so, it was still an extremely powerful force. Apart from that, the number of Deity Realm disciples had already exceeded 100,000. Not long ago, two Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal disciples had been born. They were both geniuses and had already become personal disciples. Among them, Chu Shiren had taken in the most disciples. He was the Supreme Buddha in his previous life and had his own understanding of taking in disciples.
 However, so far, other than Dao Sovereign, no new Pseudo-Sage had been born.
 The next Pseudo-Sage was most likely Zhao Xuanyuan.
 After Han Zuitian finished speaking, Li Xuan’ao said, “Sect Master, should the Hidden Sect expand? Now that the myriad worlds have welcomed a cultivation frenzy, the disciples of the various providence sects are increasing day by day. The number of mortal worlds they cover is also increasing. Only our Hidden Sect is still guarding the Hundred Peak Immortal River. I remember that more than a hundred thousand years ago, the Heavenly Race divided the nearby three regions to our Hidden Sect. It’s time to use them. Of course, the decision is still yours.”
 The reason why Li Xuan’ao dared to speak was that he could see the current situation of the Heavenly Dao. Previously, when the Calamity Race attacked, Han Jue had also sent Dao Sovereign out to fight, which meant that he still cared about the Heavenly Dao.
 Since he cared about the Heavenly Dao, it was necessary to take root and develop in it. Han Jue said, “Alright, you can arrange it. When the time comes, I’ll send you out together. Build a city around the Hundred Peak Immortal River and expand it. In the future, the Hundred Peak Immortal River will still be the center of the Hidden Sect.”
 He paused and continued, “If anyone among the personal disciples wants to go out, you can bring them along.” Dao Sovereign’s experience meant that not everyone was suitable to cultivate diligently. Occasionally, they needed to go out to train. Now that Han Jue could already completely control the Heavenly Dao, it was naturally fine to let them out.
 He did not let go in the past because he was afraid of causing trouble.
 He wasn’t afraid now. Even if the sky collapsed, he could withstand it.
 Of course, if the disciples caused trouble, Han Jue would also punish them severely. In any case, he had people in the netherworld. Those who had done evil should be severely punished. His principles and bottom line could not be broken. If they killed the innocent today, they might want to kill their master tomorrow.
 “Alright, I’ll arrange it now!” Li Xuan’ao said excitedly. Han Zuitian asked, “Grandmaster, is there a limit to the number of recruits?”
 Han Jue said, “It’s up to you. But if I’m not satisfied, I’ll find trouble with you.” These words immediately brought great pressure to Li Xuan’ao and Han Zuitian. After the two of them left, Han Jue’s gaze landed on Xing Hongxuan. The fetus was still being nurtured. It was the same size as before. At first glance, Xing Hongxuan did not seem to be pregnant. However, Han Jue could feel that the fetus’ aura had become stronger again. Han Jue suddenly had a thought and used the simulation trial to check his surroundings. (Primordial Fiendcelestial: Nurturing State) Wow!
 It was really the Primordial Fiendcelestial!
 Han Tuo only had the qualifications to become a Primordial Fiendcelestial. He had yet to completely evolve into a Primordial Fiendcelestial for the time being, but this fetus was already a Primordial Fiendcelestial when it was still in its nurturing state. Han Jue found it strange. He had only given birth to two sons. Was his bloodline so well-inherited?
 None of them were worthless.
 Han Jue had no choice but to use the derivation function. “I think I know why my youngest son can perfectly inherit my bloodline.” If it was any other father, they would be overjoyed, but Han Jue was instinctively vigilant.
 What if it was a trap?
 For example, Zhou Fan was the Dharma idol of the Seven Dao Sage. Fang Liang was chosen by the Dao Ancestor. Those experts of the Great Dao always had a way to scheme against others without anyone knowing. Han Jue didn’t want his youngest son to become a sharp blade in the enemy’s hands. [It involves karma that surpasses the current limits of the system. It cannot be deduced.] Han Jue’s heart skipped a beat when he saw this line of words.
 The first thing he thought of was the Dao Ancestor.
 The Dao Ancestor had started plotting against him after he had interfered with his Dao Integration plan?
 Han Jue asked, “Is my youngest son being controlled by others? Or is he the reincarnation of another mighty figure?” (100 million years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 As expected of my son. He’s already worth 100 million before he’s even born! (This soul is a new existence. It only involves the Transcendent Rule and is not being controlled by any living being.)
Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m Seeing this line of words, Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief.
 It was fine as long as he was not a spy. In that case, the reason why Han Jue won consecutively was that he had touched a certain Transcendent Rule.
 What was it?
 Han Jue was puzzled. Since he couldn’t figure it out, forget it. Han Jue started to check his emails.
 [Your good friend Jiang Dugu has entered the Dark Forbidden Zone.)
 [Your good friend Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du was cursed by a mysterious curse.)
 (Your good friend Pan Xin was attacked by your enemy, the Heavenly Lord of Primordial Beginning.)
 (Your good friend Ancestor Xitian was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure.)
 [Your good friend Divine Lord Peacock was attacked by an Inauspicious Evil] x209383297
 [Your son Han Tuo received guidance from a mysterious mighty figure in his dreams. His cultivation has increased greatly.)
 (Your good friend Heavenly Calamity Emperor was cursed by a mysterious curse.)
 (Your good friend Divine Lord Peacock comprehended a Mystical Power in battle. His cultivation has increased greatly.]
 (Your son Han Tuo was attacked by a mysterious Dao Devil] x7113924
 Ever since Divine Lord Peacock joined Han Jue’s circle of friends, he had been beaten up so many times that even Han Tuo couldn’t compare.
 Han Jue was surprised. After so long, Divine Lord Peacock still hadn’t escaped from the Inauspicious Divine Emperor?
 Could it be that he had guessed wrongly? It was not that the Evil Heavenly Emperor wanted to recruit Divine Lord Peacock, but that the Inauspicious Divine Emperor wanted to torture him?
 Han Jue hesitated for a moment and decided to visit Divine Lord Peacock in his dreams.
 The dream was still above the Yellow Spring. Seeing him, Divine Lord Peacock immediately revealed an arrogant expression and said, “How is it? The Inauspicious Divine Emperor can’t trap me at all! Do you have anyone else to send? Send them all! I’ll kill as many as they come!”
