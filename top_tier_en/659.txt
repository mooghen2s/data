 Han Tuo frowned and instructed. Yi Tian was always rude. If he offended that mighty figure, he couldn’t protect him. Even the Evil Heavenly Emperor had to be polite to that mighty figure and did not dare to offend him. Yi Tian curled his lips and he did not continue. He only sighed. The Heavenly Court army continued forward.
 At the same time. Outside the netherworld, in the city of the Calamity Race.
 Divine Lord Peacock sat in the quiet palace. Sensing something, he suddenly opened his eyes. A gust of wind blew towards him. The door was clearly closed and there were no windows.
 Divine Lord Peacock’s eyes narrowed as an invisible aura dispersed the strange wind in front of him. “I was wondering who it was. So it’s you, Sacred True Martial. What? You’re also here to attack the Heavenly Dao?” Divine Lord Peacock mocked. With that said, a figure appeared in front of him. The two of them remained ten steps apart.
 Sacred True Martial wore a white robe. His hair was white like a galaxy waterfall and scattered down his shoulders. He had a handsome face and a refined temperament. Compared to Divine Lord Peacock, he gave off a refreshing feeling without any pressure. Sacred True Martial smiled. “No, I’m here to stop you.”
 “You?”
 Divine Lord Peacock stood up as five-colored light lit up behind him. Sacred True Martial said, “Divine Lord, why? We shouldn’t participate in the schemes of the Great Dao Sages. Chess is necessary for the Great Dao Sages, but also not necessary. Do you understand?”
 Divine Lord Peacock said disdainfully, “Then, who are you here for? Which Great Dao Sage?” Sacred True Martial shook his head. “I’m here for you. In this Chaos, the only cultivator I admire is you. I don’t want you to go deep into the mud. Recently, the Heavenly Court’s Evil Heavenly Emperor invited me to join the Heavenly Court. He told me his plan. I think it’s very good. I hope you can join us.”
 Heavenly Court!
 Divine Lord Peacock narrowed his eyes. Sacred True Martial continued, “The Evil Heavenly Emperor is different from the previous Heavenly Emperor. He has already escaped the Great Dao Sage’s control. His Heavenly Court has obtained the recognition of the Inauspicious Evil. Sooner or later, he will unite the Dark Forbidden Zone. If…”
 “Hmph! Shut up. You think you can persuade
 me?”
 Divine Lord Peacock suddenly waved his sleeve and a five-colored divine light shot out, sweeping Sacred True Martial away.
 Immediately after, Divine Lord Peacock vanished from the hall.
 Inside the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 Han Jue, who was cultivating, sensed two extremely strong battle auras. He opened his eyes and saw Divine Lord Peacock fighting a white-robed man.
 The two of them were both Freedom Sages. In order to not affect the Calamity Race, they entered a deeper space to fight. Only those at the Freedom Realm could spy on them. Space seemed to not exist, but it actually existed. It was also divided into many levels. Even Sages might not be able to completely comprehend the rules of space.
 Han Jue couldn’t help but become curious when he saw that the two of them were on par.
 Who was this?
 Invited by Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du? Han Jue watched for a while and felt that something was wrong. These two were sparring, right? The battle was too gentle!
 Han Jue lost interest and continued his seclusion. He closed his eyes and opened them again. Another thousand years passed. Han Jue stood up and twisted his waist while checking his emails.
 (Your disciple Dao Sovereign was attacked by the living beings of the Calamity Race] x7932005
 [Your son Han Tuo was attacked by the living beings of the Calamity Race) x6982233

 How tragic!
 Another thousand years passed. The Calamity Race still occupied the netherworld. The Heavenly Dao living beings came one after another, but they couldn’t drive the Calamity Race out. Now, the Jie School, the Chan School, the Human School, the Buddhist Sect, the Holy Mother Sect, and so on were all constantly sending disciples to reinforce the netherworld.
 The Sages had never attacked. They couldn’t make a move in the Heavenly Dao, but there was Divine Lord Peacock outside the Heavenly Dao. They were not his match.
 Han Jue noticed that Pan Xin had obtained Pangu’s will.
 Tsk tsk, this Pan surname was truly suitable! He checked his interpersonal relationships. Pan Xin’s cultivation had already reached the perfected Pseudo-Sage Realm. It increased very quickly.
 He checked Dao Sovereign’s profile picture again. This kid did not let him down. Early-stage Pseudo-Sage Realm! He finally broke through!
 Han Jue smiled in satisfaction.
 He looked outside the netherworld again. Divine Lord Peacock and the other Freedom Sage had already disappeared. Eh?
 This was a good opportunity!
 Han Jue’s Sage Sense swept over and discovered that the strongest person in the Calamity Race was only a perfected Primordial Chaos Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal. He was equivalent to a perfected Heavenly Dao Sage.
 “I’m going out to capture the Sage of the Calamity Race this time with all my might. I’ll return after capturing him. Is my life in danger?”
Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m Han Jue used the derivation function. The more this was the case, the more cautious he had to be.
 (Ten billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?] Continue!
 [Not for the time being.)
 Seeing these words, Han Jue immediately disappeared from the Daoist temple.
 In the city.
 Patriarch Heavenly Calamity Emperor was cultivating in his palace. She had the image of a woman and wore black armor. Her bearing was extraordinary. Like the other members of the Calamity Race, she exuded a cold and sinister aura. Heavenly Calamity Emperor suddenly sensed something and opened his eyes.
 Almost instantly, a figure shining with divine light appeared behind her. A hand landed on her shoulder, making her unable to move.
 Imprisonment Great Dao! It was Han Jue!
 He grabbed Heavenly Calamity Emperor and left, returning to his Daoist temple. Heavenly Calamity Emperor widened her eyes and looked at him in shock. Impossible!
 Han Jue used the Great Dao of Traversal to come behind her, making her unable to react in time. He then used the Great Dao of Imprisonment to suppress her, and now, he used the Great Dao of Void to disperse her Dharmic powers.
 Heavenly Calamity Emperor was helpless and could only panic. “Who are you!” Heavenly Calamity Emperor asked in a low voice. She was at the perfected Primordial Chaos Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm and was only a step away from the Freedom Realm!
 Han Jue threw her into the Primordial Heavenly Prison without saying anything. Heavenly Calamity Emperor asked, “Are you the Freedom Sage who killed the Dark Sage King?”
 Han Jue remained silent.
 “Hmph, I didn’t expect you to be so strong. You’re probably not much different from the Divine Lord. Why didn’t you attack earlier? “When the Divine Lord returns, he will definitely be able to trace my aura! “Why are you so obsessed with the Heavenly Dao? I can sense that your Heavenly Dao providence is very weak and can’t be compared to the other Heavenly Dao Sages.”
 Heavenly Calamity Emperor kept asking questions.
 Han Jue was impatient. He used the power of the Bewitching Fiendcelestial to pull the Heavenly Calamity Emperor into an endless illusion. The Dao Field immediately quietened down. Next, Han Jue waited for the Primordial Heavenly Prison to succeed.
 The news of Heavenly Calamity Emperor’s disappearance did not spread. She usually cultivated in seclusion, and the living beings in the clan did not dare to disturb her.
 Three hundred years later, Divine Lord Peacock returned
 Discovering that Heavenly Calamity Emperor’s aura had vanished, he immediately came to her cultivation palace.
