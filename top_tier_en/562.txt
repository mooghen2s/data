 The runes of the Great Dao!
 Dao of Karma!
 Could it be left behind by Ancestor Xitian?
 Han Tuo and Yi Tian were clearly comprehending a Mystical Power.
 Han Jue retracted his gaze and asked silently, “Why did Ancestor Xitian leave behind this Mystical Power?”
 (160 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 Han Jue entered the illusion.
 If he didn’t figure these things out, Han Jue wouldn’t be able to eat and sleep in peace. It was mainly because of those Sages that he felt that the mighty figures had their own ambitions and motives.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and discovered that he had arrived at the Great Ultimate Hall.
 Ancestor Xitian sat on the mat. His aura was ethereal, like a phantom.
 A voice sounded, “I’m about to leave. I’ll leave the Heavenly Dao in your care.”
 Hearing this, Ancestor Xitian opened his eyes and frowned. “Why? I have nothing to do with the Heavenly Dao.”
 “The only person I can trust is you.”
 The mysterious voice’s words made Ancestor Xitian silent.
 Ancestor Xitian said, “I don’t want to interfere in the matters of the Heavenly Dao.”
 “You can leave behind some opportunities and let new experts appear in the future Heavenly Dao. After so many calamities, the Sage positions are almost monopolized. They are all passed down from generation to generation by the previous Sages. Many geniuses with greater potential are killed. It’s not a good thing for the Heavenly Dao’s development.”
 “Fine.”
 The illusion shattered.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and heaved a sigh of relief.
 The person who was communicating with Ancestor Xitian should be that mysterious Dao Ancestor. Since he had good intentions, Han Jue didn’t have to worry.
 He looked at his son for a while more and continued cultivating.
 The Heavenly Dao developed very smoothly. As long as there was no situation like the Heavenly Devil Calamity, Han Jue didn’t have to take action. As for the Sages, they didn’t dare to target him openly.
 In a cave abode.
 The Three Pure Sacred Ancestor was communicating with Li Muyi.
 Li Muyi frowned and said, “Li Daokong shouldn’t be targeting you because of Han Jue’s instructions. There’s something wrong with this kid’s temperament. Ignore him.”
 The Three Pure Sacred Ancestor nodded. He was very unhappy when Li Daokong was mentioned.
 He wasn’t holding back on the account of Li Muyi, but Han Jue.
 Li Muyi snorted. “If not for me protecting him in the past, this kid would have died long ago. For the time being, stay here in peace unless I order you otherwise.”
 “Mm.”
 The Three Pure Sacred Ancestor nodded.
 Li Muyi stared at the other party, feeling uncomfortable.
 For some reason, ever since he returned after leaving for a period of time, he felt that the Three Pure Sacred Ancestor had gone out of his control.
 However, the Three Pure Sacred Ancestor only listened to him and was not completely controlled by him. He couldn’t see through him.
 If the Three Pure Sacred Ancestor betrayed him, he could do nothing because he couldn’t enter the Immortal World and the Three Pure Sacred Ancestor could’nt leave the area of the Heavenly Dao.
 In the end, Li Muyi didn’t say anything else and dissipated.
 The Three Pure Sacred Ancestor closed his eyes as the cave abode fell silent.
 Dark clouds covered the sky. Ghost shadows undulated in the sea of clouds. It was ghastly and terrifying. Below was the desolate land.
 Han Tuo, wearing black clothes, and Yi Tian, wearing a beast skin robe, meditated side by side.
 In front of the two of them stood a strange stone tablet that was thirty feet tall. Strange words could be seen on the stone tablet’s surface. They were vivid and looked like flowing blood.
 Yi Tian opened his eyes and said proudly, “I’ve already learned it. What about you?”
 Han Tuo glanced at him and said, “Not as fast as you.”
 Where did this fellow come from? His potential was too terrifying!
 However, Han Tuo was not far from learning the Mystical Power. Yi Tian stood up and said, “Continue cultivating. I’ll go take a look around. There’s a powerful force hidden nearby. I’m very interested in it.”
 With that, he strode forward.
 Han Tuo frowned. “Be careful. This is a forbidden land.”
 “It’s fine. Don’t worry!”
 Yi Tian waved his hand and quickly disappeared at the end of the horizon.
 Han Tuo closed his eyes and continued to comprehend the Mystical Power.
 Several months later.
Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m Han Tuo was excited. He had successfully grasped this Mystical Power!
 “What a domineering Mystical Power. I’m stronger now. Although my cultivation isn’t at the Deity Realm, it shouldn’t be difficult to deal with a powerful enemy who has just entered the Deity Realm.”
 Han Tuo thought confidently. He suddenly felt that something was wrong. Why was Yi Tian not back yet?
 Han Tuo stood up and prepared to go looking for him.
 At this moment, a huge crack suddenly appeared in the sky. Golden light shone from it, illuminating the world.
 Figures in silver armor rushed in, led by the Heavenly God General.
 The immortals immediately dispersed.
 Han Tuo looked over from afar and was shocked by the Heavenly God General’s spirit.
 So powerful!
 “Heavenly Race?”
 Han Tuo immediately used the Earth Escape Technique to leave.
 The Heavenly God General glanced in the direction Han Tuo had left in and his gaze landed on the stone tablet.
 Eh?
 What was that?
 The Heavenly God General immediately flew over.
 For the next period of time, Han Tuo did not leave the forbidden land. Instead, he searched for Yi Tian in the forbidden land. He discovered that more and more forces entered the forbidden land and even fought.
 After searching for eight years, Han Tuo finally found Yi Tian in a cave.
 However, Yi Tian was already petrified. There were many stone statues around him with different postures. They looked like they were sealed without any preparations.
 Shocked, Han Tuo looked around cautiously.
 The cave was dark and filled with a strange mist, like the depths of the chaos.
 Han Tuo suddenly heard a faint panting.
 He was even more nervous.
 His divine sense covered his surroundings, but he didn’t sense anything wrong.
 What happened?
 Han Tuo immediately picked up Yi Tian’s stone statue and prepared to escape. At this moment, a terrifying killing intent enveloped Han Tuo, shocking him to the point that he stopped moving.
 “What a powerful body and blood vitality. The providence of the Heavenly Dao is still very weak. Kid, you’re very suitable to be my body of possession.”
 A cold voice sounded. Ghost flames suddenly burned on Han Tuo’s body, startling him so much that his body shook violently and dispersed the ghost flames.
 Han Tuo raised his arms, and blood patterns that were like the gods on the stone tablet crawled onto his body.
 “Perfect, I’ll use you to test my new Mystical Power!” Han Tuo shouted in a low voice, his eyes a little excited.
 In the Daoist temple of the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 Forty years had passed since the last derivation.
 Han Jue suddenly sensed something and opened his eyes, raising his eyebrows slightly.
 “Eh? Who dares to possess my son? You think you can touch my bloodline?” Han Jue muttered with a strange expression. “Asking to be killed!”
 He silently deduced and discovered that the origins of the existence who wanted to possess Han Tuo were strange and extremely complicated.
 It was like an existence condensed from countless ghosts in the previous calamity!
 It felt like an inferior Strange Deity.
 It was a pity to kill this fellow directly. It was better to let him be Han Tuo’s slave. It could also increase Han Tuo’s survival ability.
 Han Jue immediately cast a spell.
 In the catacombs.
 Han Tuo was also petrified like the surrounding stone statues and could not move. An endless black aura entered his body.
 An unprecedented pain made Han Tuo despair.
 He could clearly feel that his control over his body was fading and his soul was in pain.
 The mysterious existence was still laughing wildly as if he was about to obtain Han Tuo’s body.
 At this moment!
 “Ahhh,”
 The mysterious existence suddenly screamed in horror.
