 Too fast!
 How long had he been at the Emperor Realm?
 Cheating!
 Definitely!
 Han Jue fell into deep thought. Fang Liang’s rapid progress was definitely related to his soul transmigration.
 This kid had definitely set up a trap in the Primordial Era. He didn’t know why he could escape the eyes of a Sage. Perhaps the Dao Ancestor was helping him. If this continued, this kid might be able to reach the Zenith Heaven Realm before the calamity ended.
 Forget it, he couldn’t care less!
 Han Jue could only wish that his grand-disciple could survive this calamity.
 “Let’s break through to the mid-stage Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm first. I’m too weak now. I didn’t even curse Jade Emperor Zhou Yan to death.”
 Han Jue shook his head and continued cursing Jade Emperor Zhou Yan.
 In a cave abode, Xue Minghe looked at a black-robed man across the table with a smile.
 The black-robed man was the Heavenly Emperor.
 “Are you really not the Heavenly Emperor?” Xue Minghe asked with a smile.
 The Heavenly Emperor replied, “The Heavenly Emperor is already dead. I only occupied his body. You can deduce my karma. I plan to pretend to be the previous Heavenly Emperor, and when Heavenly Emperor Fang is defeated, I will control the Heavenly Court in one go and help the Dark Forbidden Lord seize the Heavenly Dao force.”
 At the mention of the Dark Forbidden Lord, Xue Minghe’s expression turned solemn, as if the Dark Forbidden Lord was secretly staring at him.
 The Heavenly Emperor said, “I need you to help me spread the news that the Chan School is secretly manipulating the war of humans and gods.”
 “Not only the Chan School, but also the Jie School.”
 Xue Minghe frowned. “What about the Human School? Although the three schools of the Dao Sect are no longer glorious, they are still a Sage Sect. The three schools are united against the outside world. If we rashly disrupt their plan…”
 The Heavenly Emperor interrupted him, “The Dark Forbidden Lord is related to the Human School. He cares about Li Daokong very much.”
Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m Xue Minghe was stunned.
 Didn’t the Dark Forbidden Lord like the Heavenly Court?
 I see!
 No wonder Li Daokong was so loyal to the Heavenly Court. Without his support, how could that kid, Heavenly Emperor Fang, sit firmly on the Heavenly Emperor’s throne?
 Xue Minghe was enlightened.
 Everything made sense now!
 How could a peerless mighty figure like the Dark Forbidden Lord suddenly appear in the world?
 But it made sense if it came from the most mysterious Human School!
 Xue Minghe had no grudge with the Human School, so this matter only made him more confident.
 “No problem. Leave this to me. I’m best at this kind of thing.” Xue Minghe smiled proudly. Jade Emperor Zhou Yan had lost his reputation because of him.
 The Heavenly Emperor nodded. “I still need your support in the Heavenly Court. From now on, I will help the Forbidden Lord recruit more followers and unite a new era of the Heavenly Dao.”
 Xue Minghe smiled. “Alright! As long as you need me, feel free to ask!”
 He cursed silently.
 Bastard!
 This guy wants to fight for credit!
 Xue Minghe wanted to be the most trusted aide of the Dark Forbidden Lord. He couldn’t let this fellow surpass him.
 After returning to Hidden Sect Island, Xing Hongxuan discovered that even if she obtained the Sage’s inheritance, she could not become the strongest prodigy of the Hidden Sect.
 Especially towards Li Yao, Xing Hongxuan felt a strong sense of danger.
 This woman was too similar to Han Jue. If he chose a Dao Companion, he would definitely choose a woman like her.
 Xing Hongxuan could only work hard and not relax.
 She had thought that she could relax after returning. Unexpectedly, she was working even harder than when she was staying in the human Holy Land.
 From the looks of it, the Hidden Sect was stronger than the Human Race’s Holy Lands?
 Xing Hongxuan shook her head and laughed, feeling that she had been thinking too much.
 Xing Hongxuan wasn’t the only one who felt the pressure. The others were the same.
 There were endless conflicts in the Immortal World, and the internal affairs of the Hidden Sect were no longer relaxed. Fortunately, there was good competition.
 Years passed.
 About fifty years passed.
 Han Jue’s cultivation improved greatly. He finally felt that the mid-stage of the Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm was no longer far away. He actually had the urge to cry. How many years had it been? This was the longest time between breakthroughs. However, although he was not far, it would still take more than a few decades.
 On this day.
 The Strange Deity approached Han Jue again and wanted to enter his body.
 He didn’t stop it. The intelligence of the strange god hadn’t increased for a long time. It was like Han Jue’s pet.
 Ever since he obtained the Ancient God’s memories from the Strange Deity, Han Jue felt that it still had a special function, but the current system couldn’t detect it.
 Could it be that there was another sign or reaction?
 Under Han Jue’s expectations, the Strange Deity completely entered his body.
 Then…
 Han Jue’s eyes widened and he muttered, “Are you playing with me?”
 The Strange Deity sneaked into his soul universe and wandered around wantonly and happily. It didn’t help him at all.
 Han Jue sealed the Reroll World to prevent the Strange Deity from harming it. The strange gods could easily destroy a mortal world.
 After a while, Han Jue suddenly sensed something.
 He began to use his inner vision and discovered that the Strange Deity was stopped in the sea of stars. It split into two balls of black mist.
 The two balls of black mist were condensing. At first glance, it looked like the strange god had laid two eggs.
 Eh?
 Han Jue seemed to have thought of something. He immediately used the Chaotic Body and condensed the Dharma idols of the Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial and the Nine Nether Fiendcelestial on the two balls of black mist.
 The Fiendcelestial Dharma idols began to fuse with the black mist…
 Could it be…
 Han Jue widened his eyes and his breathing quickened.
 The Strange Deity had inherited the providence of all the Chaotic Fiendcelestials. Han Jue might be able to create three thousand Chaotic Fiendcelestials again using the mysterious power of the Grand Unity Aspect and the Strange Deity!
 Han Jue became excited the moment this thought appeared.
 If he could control the three thousand Chaotic Fiendcelestials, wouldn’t he be invincible?
 For a time, Han Jue’s favorability towards the Strange Deity rose to a hundred stars.
 The Strange Deity was already completely controlled by him. Everything it created was naturally controlled by him. Han Jue began to observe the two balls of black mist.
 Unfortunately, the fusion did not succeed.
 Han Jue continued to try. After hundreds of times, the two balls of black mist finally retained a bit of the power of the Fiendcelestial. At least, it was a good beginning.
 Chaotic Fiendcelestials were not so easy to create. Otherwise, they would be everywhere.
 As long as it worked, it was worth it even if it took a long time!
 Several months later, the Strange Deity left Han Jue’s body. The two balls of black mist were still in the universe of stars. Han Jue named them the Fiendcelestial Qi.
 The Fiendcelestial Qi slowly absorbed the nebulous Primordial Qi in the universe as if it was cultivating
 Han Jue stopped paying attention to them and continued cultivating.
 Heavenly Court, Numinous Palace.
 Fang Liang sat on the throne expressionlessly. Below him stood Li Daokong and Li Xuan’ao.
 Li Xuan’ao had an impatient expression as he said, “The Heavenly Court can no longer cooperate with Chan and Jie schools. Otherwise, the Human School will leave!”
 “Now, all the living beings in the Immortal World think that it was the calamity caused by the three schools of the Dao Sect, but our Human School only took advantage of the situation and did not plan to harm all living beings!”
 Li Xuan’ao was truly furious and spoke bluntly.
 Li Daokong was expressionless. He stared at Fang Liang, waiting for his answer. Fang Liang said calmly, “Do you really think that the Human School isn’t involved? Jiang Dugu even dared to attack you. Is the Human School really united? “Although you’re the two orthodox disciples, have you thought about why Jade Emperor Zhou Yan dared to attack you without restraint?”
