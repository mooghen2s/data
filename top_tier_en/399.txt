 To be honest, Dao Sovereign deserved to die.
 His talent was considered top-notch in the Immortal World. Yet, he went around wandering. His death was not a pity. Jiang Yi had already turned over a new leaf. When would Dao Sovereign be able to repent?
 He still had to come to Hidden Sect Island to change his ways! Han Jue decided to kidnap Dao Sovereign in the future and educate him. He would become a member of the Hidden Sect in the future.
 The Chaotic Physique was qualified to enter the Hidden Sect.
 In the dark space, on the sun.
 Zhou Fan was frantically absorbing the True Sun Flame. His entire body had turned into a flaming man, but his eyes were still clear as he stared into the darkness.
 “Almost… Almost… Almost…”
 Zhou Fan gritted his teeth and gasped.
 At this moment, a surprised voice sounded.
 “You can actually absorb the True Sun Flame? How is that possible!
 “Wait, why is the Heaven Earth Firmament Cauldron in your soul?” Di Lantian’s voice was filled with fear. Zhou Fan said coldly, “What? Are you afraid?”
 “Who are you?” Di Lantian asked angrily. He appeared and looked down at Zhou Fan. He was clearly very nervous, and his body was trembling slightly.
 He was the leader of the Golden Crow Divine Clan, a Zenith Heaven cultivator. To make him so nervous, it could be seen that the Heaven Earth Firmament Cauldron was not simple!
 Zhou Fan roared, “I’m a mortal! What? Are you afraid after seeing the Heaven Earth Firmament Cauldron? Are you afraid?”.
 Di Lanyue’s expression changed. Zhou Fan tried his best to calm down. His expression turned sinister as he smiled. “You want to resolve karma? Then give me this sun! I want more suns. Otherwise, you can forget about resolving this karma! Let’s see if you dare to accept it!”
 Killing intent flashed across Di Lantian’s eyes. He asked, “Really?” Zhou Fan smiled and did not reply.
 Di Lantian suddenly raised his hand, and endless True Sun Flame condensed in his palm. It quickly surged into a huge three-legged Golden Crow. He waved his hand, and the enormous three-legged Golden Crow swooped down and swallowed the sun.
 Another ten years passed.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and started to check his emails.
 (Your good friend Zhou Fan has awakened his divine soul. He has obtained the providence of the Heaven Earth Firmament Cauldron. His cultivation has increased greatly.]
 (Your good friend Ji Xianshen was attacked by a Deity Realm mighty figure of the Golden Crow Divine Clan and was severely injured.)
 [Your good friend Li Daokong was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure.]
 (Your grand-disciple Fang Liang was cursed by a mysterious curse.)
 (Your good friend Li Daokong has comprehended the Dao Literature. His cultivation has increased greatly.)
 (Your disciple Hao Tian was cursed by a mysterious curse.)
 [Your good friend Dao Sovereign was attacked by your good friend Li Daokong and was severely injured.]
 Only Zhou Fan attracted Han Jue’s interest. The other emails were not surprising.
 The Heaven Earth Firmament Cauldron sounded impressive. If a Dharma treasure could show its name in the emails, it might be a Heavenly Dao Supreme Treasure.
 Han Jue asked curiously, “Why can Zhou Fan keep obtaining opportunities?”
 (5 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?] Five billion years?
 What the heck?
 Wasn’t this higher than the price for Jade Emperor Zhou Yan’s information?
 Could this guy be a Sage?
 Deduce!
 Han Jue was shocked, but he still gritted his teeth and activated it.
 I want to see what this fellow is hiding.
 [Zhou Fan: Rank Three Immortal Emperor, one of the Sages’ Dharma Idols. He transformed into a mortal body in the cycle of reincarnation. His providence is hidden in the Heaven Earth Firmament Cauldron. During his ascension, the Heavenly Dao fused the Heaven Earth Firmament Cauldron into the depths of his soul. Unless it is the Heavenly Dao’s divine sense, it cannot be seen. His true identity is the Seven Dao Sage.] Han Jue was stunned. Zhou Fan was actually a Sage’s Dharma Idol?
 No wonder his luck was so ridiculous!
 Wait!
 Seven Dao Sage… Isn’t this my good friend?
 After the lecture in the Great Ultimate Hall ended, four existences who were at least Sages had a favorable impression of Han Jue.
 Ancestor Xitian, Dijun, Jade Bodhi, Seven Dao Sage!
 Han Jue immediately checked his interpersonal relationships.
 (Seven Dao Sage: Cultivation unknown. Great Dao Divine Spirit. He controls seven Great Dao and has experienced the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity. He has lived in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End. Because you were praised by Ancestor Xitian, he has a favorable impression of you. Current favorability: 2 stars]
 No wonder the Seven Dao Sage had a better impression of him than Ancestor Xitian and Jade Bodhi. Could it be related to Zhou Fan?
 Han Jue fell into deep thought.
 Since Zhou Fan’s background was not Han Jue’s enemy, he was not worried. In the previous derivation of the future, there had never been news of Seven Dao Sage.
 The Great Dao Divine Spirit was clearly stronger than ordinary Sages. He probably could not be bothered to fight for the providence of the Immeasurable Calamity.
 This fellow had experienced the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity. What was a mere Heavenly Dao Immeasurable Calamity?
 “It seems that those people who can’t die no matter what have great origins. However, it shouldn’t be a coincidence that they landed in the same mortal world as me.”
 Han Jue thought silently. “I want to know if the Seven Dao Sage has any intention of harming me.”
 (5 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [Not for the time being.) Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief.
 That’s good!
 Continue cultivating!
 As the beings he interacted with became stronger and stronger, Han Jue’s sense of urgency increased.
 For an existence like the Seven Dao Sage, Han Jue’s curse was definitely a breeze.
 Not only did his cultivation level have to increase, but so did the Book of Misfortune.
 In the Nine Nether Purgatory.
 Jie School.
 In a Daoist temple, Huang Zuntian knelt down respectfully in front of Jing Tiangong.
 Jing Tiangong smiled in relief and said, “It’s been hard on you during this period.”
 Huang Zuntian forced a smile and said, “I won’t hesitate to serve the Jie School.”
 He felt bitter.
 This sect was too troublesome!
 He had thought that he could avoid the calamity in the Nine Nether Purgatory. He didn’t expect them to fight again. It was even more dangerous than the battles in the Immortal World.
 Jing Tiangong said, “We have already reached an agreement with the Golden Crow Divine Clan. Next, I will return to the Immortal World and ask the ancient mighty figures of the Jie School to help. From today onwards, you will control the Jie School in the Nine Nether Purgatory. With my sword as the token, no disciple will dare to disobey.”
 He waved his right hand, and a bronze sword landed in front of Huang Zuntian.
 Huang Zuntian held his sword and frowned. “You plan to continue fighting with the Golden Crow Divine Clan?”
 Jing Tiangong said matter-of-factly, “Of course. If we can’t even defeat the Golden Crow Divine Clan, how can we fight for the providence of the calamity?”
 Huang Zuntian’s heart skipped a beat.
 Too uncomfortable! It wasn’t over!
Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m Jing Tiangong said with deep meaning, “This calamity is extraordinary. It might cause the Heavenly Dao to reshuffle. Our Jie School has to grasp it. Besides, other than our Jie School, I’ve also contacted the Dark Forbidden Lord. We can’t lose!”
 Didn’t he just lose once earlier?
 Huang Zuntian cursed in his heart. He felt that Jing Tiangong had gone mad.
 The reason why he could reach peace with the Golden Crow Divine Clan was that the Jie School had given most of the Nine Nether Purgatory to them. Now, the Jie School disciples had to squeeze into a small area. How could they maintain the reputation of a Sage Sect?
 “Alright, you can leave. I’ll leave in a few days.”
 After saying this, Jing Tiangong closed his eyes.
 Huang Zuntian bowed and left the Daoist temple.
 After leaving, his expression darkened.
 Although his authority had increased, he was also in danger. This was not good!
