 Han Jue said, “It’s your fate, after all. If you still feel that you belong to the Hidden Sect, you can return at any time. However, don’t think that I will save you and help you. At least during the calamity, I won’t make a move. This is a form of responsibility towards me and the entire Hidden Sect.”
 Duan Hongchen nodded heavily. “I understand. Actually, I’m also doing very well in the Hidden Sect. You have never mistreated me. I’ve always been grateful, so I never caused trouble for the Hidden Sect. If I fight for great providence in the future, I will definitely repay the Hidden Sect.”
 Han Jue closed his eyes and waved his sleeve, signaling that he could leave.
 Duan Hongchen stood up and bowed before leaving
 Han Jue didn’t teach him the Invocation Technique. Although he already had a six-star favorability towards him, Han Jue’s own favorability towards him was limited, let alone this fellow who was facing the calamity.
 Most likely, Duan Hongchen would die in the calamity.
Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com With so many people facing the calamity, how many people could survive?
 Han Jue couldn’t help but worry about the Heavenly Emperor, Ji Xianshen, Fang Liang, Zhou Fan, and the others.
 Many of his good friends had become people facing the calamity. He estimated that a few of them would die. Otherwise, it wouldn’t make sense.
 Han Jue hoped that they would all live. If they really died, he could only mourn.
 With Han Jue’s current cultivation, it was impossible for him to risk his life for others. Even the Heavenly Emperor was the same!
 Although the Heavenly Emperor treated him very well, Han Jue would only help him if his life was not threatened. If it was a decision between his life and the Heavenly Emperor, Han Jue would only choose himself.
 It was the same no matter who replaced the Heavenly Emperor! If he died, what was the point of all this?
 In the long years of cultivation, Han Jue had always been vigilant against himself. He couldn’t forget his original intention.
 Perhaps when he reached the end of his cultivation, he would be able to do as he wished, including making up for his past regrets.
 Duan Hongchen’s departure caused quite a commotion in the Hidden Sect. After all, having interacted for so long, everyone still had feelings for each other. Therefore, they began to discuss the people facing the calamity. As the Supreme Buddha, Chu Shiren knew the most and explained to everyone what a person meant to face the calamity was.
 Han Jue didn’t pay attention to what they were talking about and focused on cultivating.
 This was life. Some had to come and go.
 Han Jue focused on cultivating. His goal was the Zenith Heaven Realm.
 The Four Mystic Divine Origin was indeed half a step away from the Zenith Heaven Realm.
 Time passed quickly. Forty years passed in a flash.
 During this period, Xing Hongxuan used the Invocation Technique to summon him once. After half a year of exercise, Han Jue finally returned.
 It wasn’t torture. To Han Jue, it was a rare form of relaxation.
 Xing Hongxuan always had a way to please him. She was always passionate towards him. Han Jue had no choice but to teach her a Mystical Power and help her become stronger.
 This was how affection should be. Both parties had to be willing. If there was always a one-sided effort, it would be wrong and unfair to the other party.
 On this day.
 Han Jue stopped cultivating and took out the Book of Misfortune to curse Li Xuan’ao for fun.
 Then, he checked his emails.
 (Your good friend Duan Hongchen has joined the Darkness Sect. His providence has increased greatly.] [Your good friend Heavenly Emperor was cursed by a mysterious curse.]
 (Because of your good friend Xue Minghe’s curse, your disciple Long Hao has been plagued by bad luck and developed mental demons.]
 (Your good friend Zhou Fan broke through in the face of death and comprehended the Great Dao of Slaughter, reaching the Emperor Realm.]
 (Your good friend Li Daokong was cursed by a mysterious curse. Because he has a Supreme Treasure, he is not affected.]
 [Your good friend Di Lantian was attacked by your good friend Li Daokong and was severely injured.)
 [Your good friend Huang Zuntian has been enlightened by the providence of the Jie School. His cultivation has increased greatly and he has become the person facing the calamity.)
 [Your disciple Su Qi returned to the Heavenly Dao with endless bad luck and was suppressed by the Heavenly Dao.]
 Duan Hongchen actually joined the Darkness Sect directly. It seemed that he had a good relationship with Xue Minghe. Xue Minghe was very sensible and was really helping the Heavenly Emperor seriously. However, seeing Long Hao encounter misfortune, Han Jue was also not happy. He continued reading.
 Zhou Fan had reached the Emperor Realm!
 This was the most shocking thing to Han Jue.
 This was a true protagonist!
 Han Jue had already met him long ago. His aptitude was average, but he always managed to survive. This experience was definitely that of a fantasy protagonist. Furthermore, after this fellow ascended, his momentum did not decrease but increased instead. He was unstoppable and counterattacked all the way. He actually forcefully reached the Emperor Realm. If this fellow survived the calamity, his future would be limitless.
 However, Han Jue still couldn’t understand how Zhou Fan could be so impressive. Fortunately, Zhou Fan’s favorability towards him did not decrease and would not pose a threat to him.
 Di Lantian was severely injured by Li Daokong. Han Jue could only admire Li Daokong for this.
 This fellow had never lost before!
 Jiang Dugu had been defeated, but Li Daokong was still wandering around.
 Huang Zuntian had become someone facing the calamity. It could only be said that he was unfortunate. There was also Su Qi. He had returned so quickly and wanted to be a shit-stirrer to make the calamity even more chaotic?
 Han Jue watched for a while and only had one feeling
 The calamity was intensifying!
 Danger!
 It was getting more and more dangerous!
 Han Jue had to become a Zenith Heaven as soon as possible. This might even trigger a system upgrade or a Dao Field upgrade. This way, he would be safer. With this thought, Han Jue entered cultivation after cursing Li Xuan’ao.
 Heavenly Court, Numinous Palace.
 The immortals gathered and made a commotion.
 Li Daokong, Li Xuan’ao, the Divine General, the Martial God General, and the Heavenly God General were all here.
 The Heavenly Emperor’s gaze landed on the Heavenly God General. His aura was the strongest among the Three Great Generals. Previously, he had raised the battle for the providence of the War God in the Heavenly Gate. After so many years, not a single War God had defeated him. Until now, no one dared to challenge him.
 With providence pouring into him, the Heavenly God General was already the publicly acknowledged strongest War God!
 The Martial God General noticed the Heavenly Emperor’s gaze and curled his lips.
 Li Xuan’ao was also sizing up the Heavenly God General. He smiled teasingly. “Heavenly God General, how does it feel to reach the Zenith Heaven Realm?”
 The Heavenly God General’s expression did not change. “You might not understand.”
 Li Xuan’ao’s face instantly turned ashen.
 Li Daokong smiled and said, “Let’s spar when you have time. I’ll teach you how to fight in the Zenith Heaven Realm.”
 Facing Li Daokong, the Heavenly God General’s eyes burned with fighting spirit, but he did not reply.
 The Heavenly Emperor suddenly said, “The Dragon Court and the Golden Crow Divine Clan have joined forces, but they have already been defeated and can’t make a comeback for the time being. However, the Heavenly Court is facing a new enemy. What do you think about the humans?”
 With that said, all the gods shut up and looked up at the Heavenly Emperor with different expressions.
 Ever since the calamity, the various Sacred Dynasties of the Human Race had been gathering. Now, they had already become powerful. They didn’t believe in immortals or Sages and said that they wanted to fight for the Human Race.
 As the protagonist of the Heavenly Dao, the greatest advantage of the Human Race was their numbers and countless connections. Almost all the major factions had human figures.
 Li Daokong was the first to speak. “Although the Human School values the Human Race as its foundation, we think they have been bewitched. We should teach them a lesson. They’re the protagonists of the Heavenly Dao, but they still want to control it. Offending your superior is unforgivable!”
