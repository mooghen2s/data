 Soon, the personal disciples pulled him into the simulation trial.
 They also wanted to know how strong Su Qi was, the person who ended the Immeasurable Calamity!
 Su Qi indeed did not fight back, but other than Dao Sovereign, no one could hurt him.
 Even Dao Sovereign couldn’t kill Su Qi.
 “How can this be!”
 Dao Sovereign was shocked. He was a Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal!
 Su Qi was stronger than him just after revival?
 How?
 Su Qi was also very surprised. Dao Sovereign’s aura made him think of the Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal he had encountered in the past. He didn’t expect that he wouldn’t die when facing such an expert. Su Qi, who had transformed into the Death Fiendcelestial, had already surpassed a Heavenly Dao lifeform. He didn’t have a Chaotic Physique, but he was truly a Chaotic Fiendcelestial. The essence of his life was like Pangu before the creation of the world, but not as strong.
 Even Dao Sovereign couldn’t kill him!
 This shocked all the personal disciples. Li Yao and Zhao Xuanyuan also participated. Su Qi was not excited. Instead, he was very embarrassed.
 He knew that the Black Hell Chicken’s suggestion was to resolve the grudge between him and the other disciples, but the situation had instead worsened? What should he do?
 He couldn’t self-destruct. He was the Death Fiendcelestial and represented the Great Dao of Death. He couldn’t let himself die.
 Han Jue witnessed the battle in the Daoist temple. When the disciples entered the simulation trial, he could watch the battle.
 Su Qi’s performance satisfied him.
 As expected of a Chaotic Fiendcelestial.
 He had encountered a Chaotic Fiendcelestial in the past. It was Jade Emperor Zhou Yan. Although he had killed him, no one in the Immortal World was his match back then. He was extremely powerful.
 Han Jue also realized the change in the mentality of the other disciples, but he didn’t interfere. Some grudges couldn’t be appeased with a word from him. It happened to stimulate the other disciples to cultivate diligently.
 A hundred years later.
 Han Jue called Dao Sovereign over.
 Ever since he sparred with Su Qi, Dao Sovereign had begun to enter seclusion crazily. His state was not right.
 Dao Sovereign entered the Daoist temple and bowed.
 Han Jue didn’t ask anything. Instead, he talked about Su Qi’s past.
 Dao Sovereign frowned and did not dare to be rude. He could only listen patiently.
 Han Jue began to talk about how he met Su Qi and how he was plotted against by Sage Fated Secrets. Dao Sovereign had mixed emotions hearing the story. He had to admit that Su Qi was indeed pitiful. He had never been able to control his fate and had always been treated as a pawn.
 “Su Qi has been burdened with bad luck since he was born. Other than the Hidden Sect, he has no friends or relatives. He has always been experiencing pain. The reason why he is stronger than you is not because his potential is better than yours, but because I gave him a body that surpasses all living beings. He’s actually my test subject and was lucky to succeed,” Han Jue said slowly.
 A body that surpassed all living beings?
 Dao Sovereign couldn’t help but ask, “What body is that?”
 He felt that Su Qi was stronger than his Chaotic Physique!
 He had once thought that the Chaotic Physique was the strongest physique. Now, it seemed like a joke.
 Han Jue said, “When you reach the Pseudo-Sage Realm, I will also reward you. As for Su Qi, I hope you won’t blame him anymore. After all, no one can stop the Sages’ schemes. The true culprit is Sage Fated Secrets.”
 Dao Sovereign took a deep breath and nodded.
 Han Jue continued, “Don’t tell the other disciples about this, especially about Su Qi’s body.”
 “I understand.”
 Han Jue sighed after Dao Sovereign left.
 He wondered if this kid would listen.
 If he really annoyed him, he would throw them all into the Primordial Heavenly Prison and gain their absolute obedience. Although it was selfish, it was effective!

 Outside the 33rd Heaven, in the endless chaos, a lofty city was hidden in the mist like an ancient ferocious beast.
 Chaotic City!
 This phenomenon had occurred for more than five thousand years and nothing had happened for the time being. However, for some reason, Zhou Fan felt that something extremely dangerous was hidden in the phenomenon.
 Not long after the Heavenly Devil Calamity, the entire Chaotic City did not let down its guard.
 At this moment, a figure appeared beside Zhou Fan. This person wore a dark gray Daoist robe. He had a handsome face and a jade sword at his waist. “Zhou Fan, it’s my turn. Go cultivate,” the Daoist-robed man said.
Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m Zhou Fan stared at him and said, “Don’t you think something is wrong?”
 The Daoist-robed man asked in surprise, “What’s wrong?” “It seems to be growing.”  The Daoist-robed man couldn’t help but look at the red ball of light in the depths of the chaos. He frowned.
 It was indeed becoming bigger. Although it was a very slow process, they could tell with careful observation with their cultivation.
 “Should we inform the City Lord?” the Daoist-robed man asked.
 Zhou Fan nodded.
 The Daoist-robed man immediately vanished. Zhou Fan was still staring into the depths of the chaos when a voice suddenly sounded in his ears, “Zhou Fan, come here. I’m waiting for
 you.”
 This voice was extremely bewitching. Zhou Fan was momentarily stunned.
 He shook his head, wanting to stay awake, but the mysterious voice sounded again.
 Soon, Zhou Fan fell into a daze. He jumped and flew towards the red ball of light. His speed was extremely fast, and he quickly disappeared into the depths of the chaos.
 Seven hundred years passed.
 Han Jue ended his seclusion. He stood up, stretched his muscles, scanned the Hundred Peak Immortal River with his Sage Sense.
 Su Qi and Dao Sovereign were both cultivating separately. It was quite harmonious.
 Currently, Su Qi lived near the Fusang Tree and established a simple Daoist temple.
 Han Jue retracted his Sage Sense and started to check his emails.
 (Your disciple Zhou Fan was attacked by an Inauspicious Evil] x283
 (Your disciple Zhou Fan is protected by your good friend Seven Dao Sage. His injuries have recovered.)

 (Your disciple Zhou Fan was saved by your good friend Seven Dao Sage and regained his body and soul.]
 Eh?
 What was wrong with Zhou Fan?
 Han Jue pinched his fingers to deduce and couldn’t help but be moved.
 Zhou Fan was no longer outside the 33rd Heaven or within the Heavenly Dao.
 When did he leave the Heavenly Dao?
 Han Jue checked his emails and discovered that Zhou Fan had already left the Heavenly Dao seven hundred years ago.
 All these years, he had been ravaged, dying and reviving.
 It had to be said that the Seven Dao Sage was really powerful. He could revive Zhou Fan remotely even in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End. Han Jue was far inferior to such a Mystical Power.
 Han Jue asked silently, “Where is Zhou Fan?”
 (3 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 The cost of derivation rivaling a Sage was probably related to the environment Zhou Fan was in.
 Han Jue chose to continue!
