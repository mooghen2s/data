 It seemed that the Heavenly Race was indeed in chaos. Ji Xianshen had even begun to search for his own force in the Human Race.
 Unfortunately, you saw wrongly.
 There was the strongest talent in the world hidden here!
 Han Jue wasn’t overly caring of Han Tuo, but hearing how disdainful Ji Xianshen was, he suddenly wanted to promote him.
 No matter what, Han Tuo was still his son. If his name shook the Immortal World in the future, Han Jue would also be proud.
 Han Jue looked at Han Tuo.
 This kid was cultivating in the small mountains in the city. He had not gone to the battlefield in the past five years. It was mainly because, in the past few years, there had not been much danger in the Eastern Guard City. The few times the beast tide had been at the lowest scale.
 The body tempering technique taught by Qingluan’er was not bad. At least among the people of the same age in the Eastern Guard City, including cultivators, they were not Han Tuo’s match.
 Han Jue waved his hand, and a ball of Dharmic powers flew into Han Tuo’s body.
 This ball of Dharmic powers would loosen the bloodline seal in Han Tuo’s body by about a ten-thousandth. It was enough for him to
 soar.
 The reason why he did not release it completely was that the bloodline of the Primordial Fiendcelestial was too powerful. He was afraid that Han Tuo would directly lose himself and even alarm the Sages.
 That day, Han Tuo suddenly felt relaxed and full of strength. His cultivation progressed even more smoothly.
 In this year, a body cultivator prodigy appeared in Eastern Guard City. His name was Han Tuo. He was less than twenty years old and could lift a million-pound boulder. He alerted all the immortals in the city.
 Ten years later.
 Han Tuo relied on his own strength to sweep through all the ferocious beast nests near the city. His reputation spread throughout the nearby human cities.
 That night.
 Han Jue, Qingluan’er, and Han Tuo were eating when Han Tuo suddenly put down his bowl and chopsticks. He took a deep breath and looked up at Han Jue. “Father, I plan to listen to you and leave the Eastern Guard City to pursue the Immortal Dao.”
 The hand that Qingluan’er held the bowl trembled slightly. She forced a smile and said, “Tuo’er, have you thought it through? After leaving home, you can only rely on yourself.”
 She knew best what cultivation meant.
 If Han Tuo returned after leaving, she and Han Jue would probably be buried by then.
 Han Tuo took a deep breath and nodded seriously.
 He looked at Han Jue.
 Even though he was already a famous prodigy of the Human Race, his respect for Han Jue didn’t decrease at all. He had always felt that his father was not simple and had seen the world.
 Han Jue asked, “This might be our last meal. Eat and drink well. I only have two pieces of advice for you when you seek the Dao.
 “Cultivate in a low-profile manner and stay away from trouble.
 “Don’t provoke others, but don’t let others provoke you.”
 Han Tuo’s heart was moved and his eyes turned red. He also knew that if he left now, things would definitely change.
 However, his Dao Heart could not be suppressed. Han Jue snorted. “Don’t act like a child. Remember, tears are the most useless thing. If you cry outside, others will only think that you’re easy to bully.”
 Han Tu could only hold back his tears.
 That night, the lights in the Han family’s residence were kept on.
 The next morning.
 Han Jue and Qingluan’er stood in front of the door and watched Han Tuo depart.
 Han Tuo turned around every three steps before finally disappearing around the corner.
 Han Jue was still a little emotional. He had watched Han Tuo grow up. Now that his son had grown up and was pursuing his own life, he had never felt such emotions. Back then, Yang Tiandong and the Chaotic Heavenly Dog’s departure had not given him such feelings.
 Indeed.
 His own bloodline felt different.
 Qingluan’er still cried in the end and leaned into his arms.
 Time passed.
 Year after year, Qingluan’er began to age.
Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com Han Jue also grew old with her.
 They were like a normal mortal couple.
 Fifty years later.
 The old Qingluan’er lay on the bed and looked weakly at Han Jue.
 She raised her trembling right hand and said softly, “Hus… Husband…”
 Han Jue asked, “What other wishes do you have?”
 “I have no regrets in this life… It’s just that before I die… I don’t know about Tuo’er’s situation…”
 “Don’t worry, he will attain the Dao. If we have a next life, in the cycle of reincarnation, he will probably come to visit us.”
 “Of course.”
 Qingluan’er slowly closed her eyes. A benevolent and expectant smile appeared on her face as she left the world.
 Han Jue’s expression was calm. He felt no sorrow or relief.
 Everything happened naturally.
 The next day, Han Jue dismissed the servants and quietly left Eastern Guard City.
 After leaving, he came to a forest. He took out Qingluan’er’s corpse and buried it in the soil, setting up a tombstone.
 The white-haired Han Jue stood in front of the tombstone. On the tombstone was the words ‘Grave of My Wife: Qingluan’er’.
 If Han Tuo returned and saw the tombstone, he would probably be able to resolve his worries.
 At this moment, a crimson fox appeared behind Han Jue and looked at him obediently.
 Although a hundred years had passed, to the crimson fox, it had only slept.
 Han Jue didn’t seem to notice its arrival and stood in front of the tomb alone to reminisce about his life.
 It had to be said that although life was short, there was always joy and suffering. It was not meaningless.
 However, to Han Jue, the true meaning was eternal life.
 His feelings for Qingluan’er were only for the sake of comprehending the Dao. They were not deep. Even if Qingluan’er died, this lifetime was still blissful.
 This karma ended here.
 “In the cycle of reincarnation, I hope you can still…” Han Jue muttered to himself. He fell silent before he finished speaking.
 “Forget it.”
 Han Jue waved his right hand and turned to look at the crimson fox. He smiled and said, “You still recognize me?”
 The crimson fox replied, “Yes.”
 Han Jue’s white hair fell down like fluttering cotton. His skin quickly recovered, and he turned into an unparalleled appearance again. His black hair was like snow and his white robe fluttered in the wind. The Sun and Moon Yin-Yang Protection appeared behind him and shone with divine light, like an immortal standing in the mortal world.
 The crimson fox was stunned.
 Han Jue looked at Qingluan’er’s tombstone and bowed, just like the wedding ceremony in the hall decades ago.
 “Let’s go.”
 Han Jue turned around and left. He ascended to the sky step by step. It was as if there was an invisible ladder under his feet. The crimson fox flew into the sky and followed closely behind.
 Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 Han Jue and the crimson fox quietly moved to the Daoist temple. Through the Heavenly Puppet, he knew that the Hidden Sect had not changed much in the past hundred years. Everything was as before, and no disciple had come to find him.
 Han Jue said, “Cultivate in front of the Daoist temple in the future. Don’t walk around.”
 The crimson fox was still stunned.
 The Immortal Qi here…
 It felt its cultivation level increase by just breathing!
 Immortal Realm!
 It was definitely in an Immortal Realm!
 It hurriedly nodded and thanked him.
 Han Jue returned to the Daoist temple and sat on the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus.
 He exhaled.
 These hundred years actually felt longer than ten thousand years, but it was not boring.
 Han Jue opened the emails and saw an email that showed that his hundred years of life experience were real.
 [Your son Han Tuo has comprehended a Sword Dao Mystical Power and stepped into the Sword Dao River.)
 Han Jue’s eyes became firm as he muttered, “Sage Dao, I’m finally coming.
 “Sages, are you prepared to welcome me?”
 His Sage Heart had been formed after a hundred years of tempering!
 Today, I will attain the Dao. This is my desire, this is my want!
