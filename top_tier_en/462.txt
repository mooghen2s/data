 The Black Hell Chicken shouted, “What are you fighting for? Isn’t it good to follow Master and constantly increase your cultivation level and stay away from danger? Think about your cultivation levels. Are you really not cultivating as fast as fighting for providence?”
 Everyone woke up after hearing these words.
 “Yes, survival is the most important.”
 “We’re already the minority who survived. When the living beings of the Heavenly Dao appear, we will be big shots.”
 “Once you want to fight to become a Sage, it will be difficult to retreat in the future.”
 “Anyway, I’ll listen to Master.”
 “Me too.”
 Everyone discussed. Han Jue smiled and didn’t continue to speak.
 He began to look around, preparing to build his own Daoist temple nearby. As for Hidden Sect Island, it would be a mystic realm.
 Time was no longer pressing after the Heavenly Dao restarted.
 Han Jue found the right location and waved his right hand, causing a Daoist temple that was not too big to condense in the forest.
 “All of you should cultivate separately. Although there are no longer any living beings in the Heavenly Dao, don’t waste time,” Han Jue said, and the disciples immediately dispersed.
 Xing Hongxuan came over and asked with a smile, “Husband, can I stay in your Daoist temple?”
 Han Jue said, “Move next to me. It’s not convenient for us to stay together.”
 Xing Hongxuan curled her lips and could only nod. It was good enough to be this close to Han Jue.
 Chang Yue’er wanted to say something but hesitated. In the end, she chose to leave with Fairy Xi Xuan.
 The two of them were not as strong as Xing Hongxuan, so they didn’t have the same courage.
 Han Jue didn’t return to the Daoist temple. Instead, he started to wander around the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 Although he was almost 8,000 years old, he had never really been anywhere. In the past, when he came to the Immortal World, he had not stayed long, afraid that he would encounter danger.
 Now, no one below the Heavenly Dao could threaten him. He naturally had more guts.
 The others didn’t follow Han Jue. They knew that he wanted to walk alone.
 Dao Comprehension Sword stared at his back and muttered, “I wonder how strong Master is now.”
 Li Yao said calmly, “He could understand the situation of the calamity at any time in the Dark Forbidden Zone. I suspect that he’s not far from becoming a Sage. He might have already become one. But he doesn’t seem to be interested in the Sage position.”
 Dao Comprehension Sword nodded in agreement.
 Han Jue spread his divine sense as he walked forward.
 He felt that this area might be special. To be able to maintain the landscape in perfect condition, it had to be a holy land before the calamity ended.
 The Spirit Qi here was also abundant, almost comparable to the Spirit Qi Xing Hongxuan had in the Human Race’s Holy Land. Of course, it was still far inferior to his Dao Field.
 Not long after, Han Jue discovered a mysterious restriction hidden underground.
 He immediately dived underground and came to a mysterious cave. In front of him was a huge stone door. It was majestic and had many strange patterns carved on it.
 This stone door contained a powerful restriction. Unless the divine sense of a Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal approached it, they wouldn’t be able to sense its existence, let alone everything inside.
 Han Jue condensed the Void Fiendcelestial Dharma idol. The Void Fiendcelestial raised his hand and waved it, causing the power of nothingness to collide with the stone door. The restriction on the stone door directly turned into nothingness, and even the stone door itself turned into dust.
 Han Jue looked carefully and discovered that behind the stone door was a huge dark cave with huge eggs hidden inside.
 Eh?
 Han Jue scanned with his divine sense and discovered that these eggs actually contained life. Most of them were still alive.
 How did they avoid the Dao Destruction Mystical Power?
 He immediately asked in his mind.
 (2 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 (The Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal of the Qilin Race sacrificed his cultivation and providence with his Innate Mystical Power, isolating this cave from the Heavenly Dao and preventing it from being affected by the Dao Destruction Mystical Power.]
 Qilin Race!
 Han Jue was secretly vigilant. His divine sense didn’t capture the existence of other mighty figures. He had to use the simulation trial to detect them and didn’t capture the existence of the Qilin Race’s Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal.
 In other words, that fellow was really dead.
 Han Jue walked into the cave and counted the eggs.
 Leaving aside the lifeless eggs, there were more than 1,200 Qilin eggs that could survive. There was a certain restriction hidden in the cave that could transport underground Spirit Qi into the Qilin eggs and let them grow.
 “Will subduing these Qilin eggs cause karma with Sages?” Han Jue asked in his mind.
 (3 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [Not for the time being.]
 Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief. In that case, he would take these Qilin eggs.
 He carefully surveyed the cave. After confirming that there was no danger, he called Murong Qi and Dao Sovereign over.
T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by nov(ê(l)biin.co/m Murong Qi was considered the Hidden Sect’s manager. The Hundred Year Competition was organized by him. He was very talented in management, and Dao Sovereign was the strongest disciple.
 “These Qilin eggs belong to the Hidden Sect. Take care of them in the future,” Han Jue instructed.
 Murong Qi and Dao Sovereign were stunned as they looked at the thousand or so Qilin eggs.
 Dao Sovereign sighed. “It’s indeed the territory of the Qilin Race.”
 Murong Qi asked, “The Qilin Race has already perished?”
 Han Jue had no choice but to derive it again. After consuming two billion years of his lifespan, he confirmed that the Qilin Race had been wiped out, and only these eggs were left.
 “Yes, that’s all. They’ll enter the Hidden Sect in the future,” Han Jue replied and left.
 Murong Qi and Dao Sovereign walked into the cave and clicked their tongues in wonder.
 After leaving the underground, Han Jue continued wandering.
 Several days later, he returned to the Daoist temple to cultivate. He created a Heavenly Puppet and went out to inquire about the situation.
 Although he was already strong enough, he still did not want to go out and wander around.
 What if he was surrounded by a hundred Pseudo-Sages?
 Cough cough!
 That was too exaggerated. How could there be a hundred Pseudo-Sages waiting for him?
 Anyway, it wasn’t absolutely safe. Han Jue still didn’t want to leave the vicinity of the Dao Field.
 He enveloped the new Daoist temple with the system barrier. The outside world wouldn’t be able to spy on the inside.
 The excitement of being in a new place was quickly wiped away by time. The Hidden Sect disciples also began to enter seclusion to cultivate.
 In the blink of an eye, decades passed.
 In the Daoist temple, three lines of words suddenly appeared in front of Han Jue.
 [Detected that you are 8,000 years old and your life has taken another step forward. You have the following choices:]
 [1: Come out immediately and preach to the world, leaving behind a glorious name. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment and a Mystical Power inheritance.]
 [2: Cultivate in a low profile manner and do not participate in disputes. You can obtain a Dao Field guard.)
 Han Jue chose the second option without hesitation.
 This Dao Field guard could only be a Pseudo-Sage, so he chose Shi Dudao again.
 [Dao Field Guard has begun to duplicate]
 Han Jue thought for a moment and asked in his mind, “Can I move the Dao Field out of Hidden Sect Island?”
 The Dao Field covered an extremely large area. It was not appropriate to restrict it to Hidden Sect Island now.
 (100 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?] So expensive?
 Han Jue cursed silently. Fine!
 For safety reasons, it was better to move out.
 Continue!
