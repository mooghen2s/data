 He was at least a Great Dao existence!
 In the darkness, a huge object was surging. It was terrifyingly huge, as if it could devour everything.
 Han Jue used the simulation trial again.
 [Chaotic Deity: Great Dao Divine Spirit, guardian of the Chaotic Order]
 It was indeed a Great Dao Divine Spirit!
 At this moment.
 Li Zizai suddenly fled and vanished.
 The extremely dangerous aura vanished. It was probably chasing after Li Zizai.
 Han Jue’s gaze landed on the Great Dao of Extreme Origin again. Ever since he arrived, the light and darkness of the Great Dao of Extreme Origin had changed, as if it was responding to him.
 Should he rush in?
 Han Jue could feel that the Great Dao of Extreme Origin would not reject him. Now that there were no other living beings nearby, this was the best opportunity. Even if it didn’t work, he could still leave.
 With that thought, Han Jue controlled Hidden Sect Island and rushed into the Great Dao of Extreme Origin.
 Almost instantly, the Great Dao of Extreme Origin shrank and the entire space fell into darkness.
 Inside the Great Dao of Extreme Origin, Hidden Sect Island was bathed in a strong light.
 (Detected the existence of the Great Dao of Extreme Origin]
 A line of words appeared in front of Han Jue. He immediately tried to absorb the Great Dao of Extreme Origin. The Great Dao of Extreme Origin was too huge. Han Jue couldn’t absorb it directly. It seemed that he could only fuse it here.
 Han Jue began to fuse with the Great Dao of Extreme Origin with a nervous mind.
 After a while, the Great Dao of Extreme Origin emitted a light. Just like before, it illuminated the dark space.
 For the next period of time, Li Zizai and the Chaotic Deity did not return.
 The peace lasted for 860 years.
 Han Jue suddenly sensed something and opened his eyes. A figure appeared outside the Great Dao of Extreme Origin. This person’s body was gathered with a black aura, and he wore a pure white mask. There was only one vertical eye on the mask, and his pupil spun around.
 Seeing this person, Han Jue’s heart almost jumped to his throat. He immediately used the simulation trial to test the other party.
 (Great Dao Concealment Fiendcelestial: Transcendent Dao Expert, Chaotic Fiendcelestial]
 Great Dao Concealment Fiendcelestial?
 Han Jue frowned. There was a Great Dao Concealment Fiendcelestial among the Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols he had cultivated so far.
 Why was this happening?
 Could it be that all three thousand Fiendcelestials might exist somewhere?
 Han Jue was terrified. Who created this Grand Unity Aspect?
 If it was the system, how did it create it?
 The Great Dao Concealment Fiendcelestial didn’t seem to see him. It observed for a while before leaving
 Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief and continued to fuse with the Great Dao of Extreme Origin.
 “Can the Great Dao of Extreme Origin block the prying from outside?” Han Jue asked in his mind.
 (100 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [Yes]
 I see!
 Relieved, Han Jue focused on fusing with the Great Dao of Extreme Origin.
 Five hundred years later. Li Zizai returned again. His aura had weakened greatly. He was probably being hunted down by the Chaotic Deity.
 Even so, this fellow still dared to return. He really did not give up.
 Li Zizai stayed for a few months before leaving again.
 Han Jue began to enter seclusion fully. Anyway, he was in the second arena and was not afraid of attacks.
 …
 Earth Immortal World, Reincarnation Space.
 In a dazzling hall, Yang Du and the nine Reincarnators stood side by side. In front of them stood a figure in a golden robe and a golden crown.
 Yang Du asked, “Overgod, why are you looking for us?”
 The Golden-Robed Overgod said, “The Reincarnation Space has developed until now and has already become stronger. It has been spied on by other spaces. I have agreed to fight with the other masters of space. You will encounter them in the next mission world. Your goal is to annihilate them.”
 The ten Reincarnators were shocked and looked at each other.
 This was the first time they received such a mission.
 “Are the other party’s Reincarnators very strong?”
 “Not bad. The recent missions are really not difficult.”
 “Isn’t the Reincarnation Space the only one?”
 “Hmph, in that case, let’s put down our grudges first.”
 The Reincarnators began to communicate. Yang Du did not interrupt.
 Yang Du thought of Han Jue. Could Han Jue be the mastermind of the other spaces?
 No.
 I can’t think like that.
 Before that lord instructed him, he had to do his best to show his talent in the Reincarnation Space.
 That lord had chosen him because he definitely hoped that he would obtain an extremely high status and authority in the Reincarnation Space.
 The Golden-Robed Master said, “It’s not only you. The other Overgods will also choose ten Reincarnators, totaling 120. I hope that one of you can obtain first place. At that time, I will reward you heavily.” The Reincarnators agreed in unison, all filled with confidence.
 In the 33rd Heaven, the Sages gathered in the Universal Hall.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du asked, “Why hasn’t Fellow Daoist Han Jue done anything recently?”
 Not long ago, he dreamed of Han Jue but couldn’t capture him. He failed.
DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎 Qiu Xilai asked, “Senior, what do you mean?”
 The other Sages also looked at Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du. He couldn’t have gathered them just to ask about Han Jue, right?
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “The Dark Sage King has sent me a letter of challenge. He said that he will definitely devour the Heavenly Dao in ten billion years. He has already begun to bewitch the living beings of the Immortal World and is preparing to launch a calamity first. He’s so blatant. What do you think he’s doing?”
 The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate snorted. “Also, he already knows that we are going to choose a new Sage and wants to sow discord.”
 Sect Master Tian Jue nodded.
 Emperor Xiao said, “I think so, too. The Dark Sage King might be anxious.”
 “As long as I wait in the Heavenly Dao, he will be helpless.”
 “The Reincarnation Mystic Realm is indeed controlled by the Dark Sage King. We should be careful.”
 “The Heavenly Dao is controlled by us. Why should we be afraid of him?”
 The Sages discussed.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du’s eyes were faint as he said, “Recently, the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End has stirred up another battle to conquer the Dao Devils. This time, the one who lost was Senior Seven Dao Sage. I suspect that the Dark Sage King might be related to the Dao Devils.”
 The Sages’ expressions changed drastically.
 They all had their own backing in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End.
 The Seven Dao Sage was the strongest existence in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End. If he lost, how could their backing be fine?
 “Everyone, the Dark Sage King is attacking. We have to be wary. We plan to join forces to leave the Heavenly Dao and fight with him first. We will figure out his strength before making plans,” Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said in a low voice. His voice was firm and irrefutable.
 For some reason, the Sages thought of Li Muyi and Qiu Xilai’s schemes. Could Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du also be plotting something like that?
 The longer he lived, the more afraid he was of death. This was the most suitable for a Heavenly Dao Sage.
 Thinking of this, the Sages were vigilant.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du saw through their thoughts and said, “You don’t trust Li Muyi, but you don’t trust me? If I want to scheme against you, I don’t have to beat around the bush. Don’t forget, I’m not a true Heavenly Dao Sage. I’ve long attained the Great Dao. I’ve only returned to control the Human School for the time being and help increase the Heavenly Dao’s providence.”
 Fuxitian smiled and said, “That makes sense. Fellow Daoist Xuan Du won’t do that. Let’s think about how to deal with the Dark Sage King. I heard that after the Dark Sage King devoured the Little Heavenly Dao’s providence, he could already hurt our Heavenly Dao Dao Fruit.”
