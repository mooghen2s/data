 Li Daokong’s favorability towards Han Jue increased to 5.5 stars and Li Xuan’ao to 5 stars.
 The two of them really betrayed the Human School and had nowhere to go. After Han Jue displayed his strength, they were naturally happy.
 Li Xuan’ao’s disdain towards Han Jue mainly came from seniority and cultivation. After this lecture, they all determined that Han Jue was not a junior and was definitely a Sage!
 No wonder Han Jue had always avoided the calamity. Sages didn’t need to fight for great providence from the calamity at all!
 Also!
 They felt that Han Jue was stronger than Li Muyi!
 After hearing his lecture, they gained more insight than from Li Muyi’s lecture.
 Li Daokong had a feeling.
 Han Jue’s Great Dao was stronger than Li Muyi’s!
 After the lecture, Han Jue returned to the Daoist temple alone.
 Eight years later.
 Li Daokong and Li Xuan’ao came to visit him.
 Han Jue let them in. Their favorability towards him was already very high. It was just nice to make them submit.
 Li Daokong was the first to ask, “You’re a Sage?”
 Han Jue shook his head.
 Li Xuan’ao asked, “What Dao were you preaching about earlier?”
 “Great Dao of Extreme Origin.”
 Li Daokong and Li Xuan’ao looked at each other and saw the confusion in each other’s
 eyes.
 They had never heard of the Great Dao of Extreme Origin.
 Han Jue said, “This is the Great Dao I created. Don’t tell anyone.”
 The disciples were shocked.
 Creating a Great Dao!
 No wonder he shook his head. This was not something a Sage could do!
 Could he be the Dao Ancestor?
 Li Daokong and Li Xuan’ao were shocked.
 They didn’t think Han Jue was lying. The Great Dao of Extreme Origin was indeed stronger than any Great Dao they had heard of.
 [Li Xuan’ao’s favorability towards you has increased. Current favorability: 6 stars]
 Han Jue raised his eyebrows.
 This Li Xuan’ao…
 Is it so easy to conquer such a cold and annoying fellow?
 Or did he worship experts?
 Han Jue looked at Li Daokong and felt that he had guessed correctly.
 Li Xuan’ao said, “We definitely won’t tell anyone. After all, we’re already from the Hidden Sect. Sect Master, if Li Muyi comes personally, will you hand us over?”
 This term of “Sect Master” made Han Jue feel comfortable.
 He liked to see others’ attitudes towards him change 180 degrees.
 Li Daokong glanced at Li Xuan’ao and did not say anything
 He knew his junior brother’s nature best.
 “As long as you cultivate in peace and don’t cause trouble outside or within the sect, I will protect you,” Han Jue replied calmly.
 He wasn’t afraid of Li Muyi.
 As long as he was in the Dao Field, he was not afraid of the Heavenly Dao Sages.
 Previously, the various Sages had plotted against him. He had long treated them as imaginary enemies.
 Li Xuan’ao immediately promised that the two of them would not cause trouble.
 After chatting for a while, the two of them left the Daoist temple.
 Back at his residence.
 Li Daokong said angrily, “You submitted so quickly. It seems that I didn’t dig out your eyes in vain.”
 Li Xuan’ao snorted. “Senior, what are you pretending for? Since you’ve become his disciple, you should know your status. Besides, the Sect Master doesn’t dislike us and gives us a lecture openly. Isn’t such magnanimity worth following?”
 Li Daokong was silent. He turned around and returned to his Daoist temple.
 Li Xuan’ao did not return to cultivate. Instead, he walked towards the Fusang Tree.
 Two hundred years passed.
 Li Xuan’ao had completely fused into the Hidden Sect. He taught the Chaotic Heavenly Dog the Mystical Power to resolve the grudge and often sparred with Dao Sovereign, Zhou Fan, and the others.
 Li Xuan’ao and Dao Sovereign were both at the early stage of the Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm. It was difficult for the two of them to fight, but most of the time, Li Xuan’ao had the upper hand. After all, he had lived for a long time and was very experienced.
 Compared to Li Xuan’ao’s activity, Li Daokong cultivated in seclusion and rarely walked around.
 The two of them had different goals. In the entire Hidden Sect, only Han Jue could catch his eye.
 On this day.
 A preaching sound came from the human cities near the Hundred Peak Immortal River. After so many years, the human population had been increasing. Many human cities had been established in a radius of 30 million kilometers.
 However, there were not many experts among the humans, much less preaching.
 This lecture was spread very widely, and all the Hidden Sect disciples in the Hundred Peak Immortal River could hear it.
 Li Xuan’ao suddenly flew into the sky with a solemn expression.
 Dao Sovereign rushed over and asked, “What? You know that person?”
 Because they often sparred, the two quickly established a friendship.
 “Dan Long is a Pseudo-Sage of the Human School. He can be considered our Uncle-Master. He was once the second disciple of the Human School.” Li Xuan’ao’s expression was ugly.
 He knew very well how powerful Dan Long was. His arrival this time was not a coincidence.
 Dao Sovereign consoled, “Don’t be afraid. As long as you don’t go out, he can’t do anything to you.”
 Li Xuan’ao nodded and took a deep breath. “It seems that Li Muyi is really angry.”
 “Hmph, in order to capture us, the Human School sent such an expert. In the previous calamity, we sought their help. Not only did they not provide assistance, they even sent Jiang Dugu to cause trouble for us!”
 The more Li Xuan’ao spoke, the angrier he became. In the end, he gritted his teeth.
 Dao Sovereign fell silent.
 Back then, he had also been in the Heavenly Court. He had been puzzled, but he did not expect Li Daokong and Li Xuan’ao to have had such a hard time.
 Speaking of which, the Heavenly Court was abandoned. Only Li Daokong and Li Xuan’ao persisted until the calamity ended.
 This matter quickly spread throughout the Hidden Sect. All the disciples knew that the Human School was looking for trouble.
 However, since Han Jue didn’t move, they weren’t too worried.
 Han Jue had already detected Dan Long’s existence. He was a perfected Pseudo-Sage.
 Fortunately, he could kill him instantly!
 Therefore, Han Jue continued cultivating and didn’t care about Dan Long.
 Fifty years later.
 Dan Long finally couldn’t sit still. He came outside the Hundred Peak Immortal River and shouted, “Sect Master of the Hidden Sect, let our Human School’s first and second disciples out.”
 Han Jue ignored him.
 After a while.
 Dan Long frowned. The Hundred Peak Immortal River was silent. No one bothered with him.
 He continued, “This is the Sage’s intention. If the Hidden Sect wants to avoid the world, it’s best not to interfere in the matters of other sects.”
 Han Jue still ignored him.
 Li Xuan’ao stood in Li Daokong’s Daoist temple with a nervous expression.
 He asked, “Does Sect Master plan to pretend to be dead?”
 Li Daokong said calmly, “Continue watching.”
 The Hundred Peak Immortal River fell silent again.
Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates This time, Dan Long was angry.
 Too much!
 This Sect Master of the Hidden Sect was really not giving him face!
 Just as he was about to attack, Han Jue’s voice floated out, “Who are the eldest and second disciples of the Human School?”
 Dan Long suppressed his anger and said, “Li Daokong! Li Xuan’ao!”
 “They aren’t here. There are no such people among my disciples. Senior might be mistaken.”
 “You’re telling me this? I’ll know if there is after I check!”
 “No, I can’t let you in. If your goal is to kill me, won’t it be stupid of me to let you in?”
 Hearing Han Jue’s words, Dan Long laughed angrily.
 Great!
 He said disdainfully, “Whether you agree or not, I’m going in regardless!”
 He immediately rushed towards the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 He wasn’t surprised when he bumped into the array formation. It was obvious there was an array formation here since his divine sense couldn’t spy inside.
 Dan Long took out a white jade sword and slashed.
