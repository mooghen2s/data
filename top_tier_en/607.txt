 The wasteland was endless.
 Han Tuo and Yi Tian were in a pile of rubble. The two of them were in a very dispirited state and were meditating to heal their injuries.
 Yi Tian opened his eyes and asked, “Where do you think we are? The Connate Qi here is extremely surging, but along the way, we rarely see living beings, and it doesn’t seem like a small world.”
 Han Tuo opened his eyes and said, “I’m not sure, either. I’m still thinking about how we could escape. Don’t you think it was too easy? It’s as if someone led us here.”
 Yi Tian frowned. Something was wrong.
 “Be careful. We’ll move in another four hours. I feel like something’s watching us,” Han Tuo said softly as he glanced at a small flag beside him. This was his Dharma treasure that could detect the approach of evil spirits.
 Yi Tian took a deep breath. Because Han Tuo was here, he did not panic.
 The two of them had experienced too many life and death situations together. They both felt that the other party was reliable.
 Four hours later.
 The two of them left on time.
 At this moment, Han Tuo suddenly stopped and raised his hand to stop Yi Tian.
 Yi Tian stared ahead. Several kilometers away, a white-robed man sat in the air. He wore a stone mask and his white hair fluttered in the wind. His aura was almost ethereal. The two of them couldn’t sense his aura, but they could see it.
 The two of them looked at each other and tacitly turned around to leave. They directly used their full speed and kept moving, quickly leaving this place. Several days later. The two of them stopped. The environment was still the wasteland that had developed their vision. Not far away, a skeleton was as huge as a mountain range could be seen. It was ghastly and terrifying “Damn it, are we trapped in an array formation? Why do we feel the same no matter where we go?” Yi Tian cursed, almost breaking down.
 They were Deity Realm cultivators, after all. Flying for so long was enough for them to travel throughout the Immortal World. However, here, they still couldn’t find the direction to leave.
 They had tried to fly up, but the dark clouds in the sky were filled with killing intent. They blocked their Dharmic powers, and they couldn’t penetrate them.
 Han Tuo was also very anxious, but he couldn’t panic now. He said, “Probably not. That skeleton can prove it. It’s just that this place is too big. What place is larger than the Immortal World?”
 Yi Tian was moved and muttered, “Could it be the legendary Deity Realm of the Ruins of End?”
 “The Deity Realm of the Ruins of End? Isn’t the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End a chaotic space?”
 “Who knows?”
 The two of them began to talk in low voices.
 Yi Tian seemed to have sensed something and suddenly looked up. His pupils suddenly widened, and he subconsciously took out his Dharma treasure to prepare for battle.
 The mysterious white-robed man they had encountered a few days ago had appeared here.
 Han Tuo was also shocked. They no longer fled. If they could be caught, how could they escape?
 Han Tuo asked in a low voice, “What do you want?”
 The white-robed man was stunned. “You can see me?”
 “Of course!” Yi Tian said unhappily. If not for him not knowing the other party’s strength, he would have long attacked. The white-robed man was silent. Han Tuo and Yi Tian were extremely nervous.
 Just as they were about to lose control, the white-robed man said, “You have the aura of darkness on you. If you stay in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End, you will be expelled. Hurry up and leave.”
 He waved his sleeve. Han Tuo and Yi Tian felt the world spin and felt dizzy.
 When they opened their eyes again, they came to a dark space.
 Yi Tian touched his head and gritted his teeth. “We’re out?”
 Han Tuo did not answer. He frowned. Who was that fellow just now?
 At this moment, a huge suction force suddenly appeared in front of them and sucked them away.
 They couldn’t resist even if they were at the Deity Realm.
 Darkness occupied their vision, and soon, they were on the ground.
 The two of them immediately stood up, stunned.
 They landed in a huge cage with dozens of living beings imprisoned beside them.
 An old monk said faintly, “You’ve also returned. Stop struggling. You can’t escape at all. The Dark Falling Prison is near the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End. You’ve already been tainted by the power of darkness. If you escape to the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End, you will be expelled and then fall back here.”
 Han Tuo frowned. “In that case, why did he let
 us go?”
 The old monk didn’t say anything.
 Yi Tian asked, “Old man, you seem to know a lot. Do you know who trapped us?”
 They had also tried to communicate with other living beings, but like them, the other living beings did not understand the Dark Falling Prison at all.
 Calamity’s Vengeful’s memories came from the calamity of the Immortal World. He didn’t know the Dark Falling Prison.
 “Dark Sage King, a mighty figure outside the Heavenly Dao. He controls the Dark Forbidden Zone,” the old monk said slowly.
 “How is he compared to Sages?”
 “Not long ago, the Heavenly Dao Sages joined forces and returned in failure. They almost died.”
 “How can this be!”
 Han Tuo and Yi Tian were moved.
 In their understanding, Sages were the top existences.
 The old monk said faintly, “So, give up. Since we can’t escape, why don’t we submit to the Dark Sage King and wait for the situation?”
 Han Tuo and Yi Tian looked at each other.
 “Then, who are you?” Yi Tian couldn’t help but ask.
 The old monk replied, “Primordial Chaos Buddha. Have you heard of me?”
 The two of them widened their eyes. How could they not have heard of the Primordial Chaos Buddha?
 However, why did he fall here?
 Primordial Chaos Buddha looked indifferent, but he was as curious as a cat.
 Why did this kid look so similar to his master? Could it be his son?
 Although he was a Pseudo-Sage, he couldn’t deduce the karma of a Sage.
 It was precisely because Han Tuo and Han Jue had similar looks that he took the initiative to speak.
 Yi Tian and Han Tuo were even more interested in the Primordial Chaos Buddha. The three of them began to communicate.
 Four hundred years passed quickly after Han Jue used the Creation Spirit Stone.
 He chose the Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial because it was the first idol he cultivated. He had some emotional attachment to it.
 After fusing with the Creation Spirit Stone, the Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial’s Fiendcelestial Qi had already condensed into a physical body. Its intelligence was also born. Han Jue could clearly sense it. At most in a thousand years, the Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial would be truly
 born.
 (Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du sent you a dream. Do you accept?]
 Han Jue, who was cultivating, was interrupted by this notification. He thought for a moment and chose to accept it.
 In the dream.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du was the first to ask, “Fellow Daoist Han, what do you think? Give me a signal.”
 Han Jue asked, “Are you in a hurry?”
 “Yes, the Pseudo-Sage we sent to suppress the Reincarnation Mystic Realm was captured by the Dark Sage King. Now, the Reincarnation Mystic Realm is already out of control. As long as the Heavenly Dao lifeforms approach, they will be captured by the Dark Sage King. The Dark Sage King is still bewitching the living beings near the Reincarnation Mystic Realm.”

 “No, our spells are directly isolated by the power of the Heavenly Dao. We suspect that the Heavenly Dao Spirit that has disappeared for a long time might have found the Dark Sage King. We have to eliminate him as soon as possible, or the consequences will be unimaginable.” For the first time, anxiety appeared on Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du’s face. Han Jue also realized that things had become serious. He didn’t want the Heavenly Dao to be destroyed. If that happened, he wouldn’t have a place to stay
 “Have you already contacted the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End?”
 “Yes, we’ll wait for your agreement before deciding when to attack.” “Then attack.”
