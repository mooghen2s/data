 After cursing the Chaotic Deity, Han Jue’s life became comfortable again.
 He didn’t know about the changes in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End, but the Immortal World was still stable. After being attacked by the five Sages, the Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage became well-behaved and did not take the next step. Under the siege of the various factions, the demons were torn apart.
 Later, the Golden Crow Demon Emperor announced that he would lead the Golden Crow Divine Clan to leave the demons. There was no king among the demons, and they were completely dissolved. The various Demon Kings and Demon Saints no longer called themselves demons.
 The demons declined just like that.
 The demons hated the various factions and did not want to join the Famous Race. Therefore, they began to use the name of the Ancient Race a hundred thousand years ago. The Sages had no objections to this. They were enemies with the Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage, not the demons themselves.
 Time passed quickly. Year after year passed. A thousand years passed in the blink of an eye. Han Jue opened his eyes and stretched. The chaos did not affect the Heavenly Dao. Everyone didn’t even know what was happening outside.
 Han Jue checked his emails and couldn’t help but be moved.

 So many attacks!
 Inauspicious Evil! Mysterious Dao Devil!
 Han Jue noticed that Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du was also attacked. He looked up and discovered that Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du wasn’t in the Dao Field outside the 33rd Heaven. He had probably gone to the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End earlier.
 The Deity Realm of the Ruins of End was in chaos!
 Han Jue was amused.
 He didn’t expect the curse to have such an effect. Although this matter would harm many innocent people, he couldn’t care less. I would rather see others die than die myself! With the hatred of the Chaotic Deity, he would find trouble with Han Jue sooner or later. In any case, the Chaotic Deity would die sooner or later.
 Once the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End was in chaos, they would no longer scheme against the Heavenly Dao in a short period of time. No wonder the Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage was so quiet.
 “Sigh, I’m still the greatest contributor to the Heavenly Dao.” Han Jue sighed. Oh Dao Ancestor, if you see this, you must remember my kindness and not scheme against me!
 After reading the emails, Han Jue looked at the Immortal World.
 Ever since Li Daokong attained the Dao, Han Yu had been considered to have graduated. Now, he had traveled the Immortal World alone and his reputation had soared.
 This kid was already an Immortal Emperor. Not bad. Han Yu hid in a forest and cultivated. He didn’t encounter any trouble for the time being.
 The current Immortal World had already surpassed the Immortal World from before the calamity. It was mainly because the Sages took turns preaching the Dao, causing the cultivation level of the cultivators to increase very quickly. Who would have thought that a hundred thousand years ago, the Immortal World was still barren?
 Han Jue came to the second Dao Field and started to pay attention to the Fiendcelestial candidates.
 Yang Du had already left the Earth Immortal World. Han Jue calculated that this fellow was not in danger. He even obtained many great opportunities and had great providence.
 As for the other Fiendcelestial candidates, only two were still alive.
 They were called Ren Gang and Yin Hongchen. Yin Hongchen was a woman.
 Her appearance was not devastatingly beautiful, and she did things extremely ruthlessly. She usually did not take the initiative to provoke others, but if she discovered that someone was a threat to her, she would definitely eliminate them as quickly as possible. Ren Gang was filled with righteousness and could easily make friends.

 Just like facing Yang Du, Han Jue didn’t expose his identity. After making arrangements for the two of them, Han Jue walked out of the Daoist temple to visit Murong Qi, the crimson fox, and the Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial. Their cultivation levels increased very quickly. The Spirit Qi in the Dao Field was even richer than in the Immortal World.
 Han Jue explained the Dao to them alone. The Great Dao of Extreme Origin contained the profundities of all the Great Dao and could allow them to gain some insights. Ten years later, Han Jue returned to the Hundred Peak Immortal River and continued cultivating.
 Dark Forbidden Zone. The Evil Heavenly Emperor sat on a huge meteor and cultivated. Black Qi surrounded him, and his aura was terrifying. At this moment, a black shadow appeared in front of him and knelt down.
 “Your Majesty, the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End is already in chaos. The Seven Dao Sage was attacked by a powerful Dao Devil and was severely injured. More and more living beings began to escape towards the Heavenly Dao,” the black shadow said in a low voice with excitement. The Evil Heavenly Emperor slowly opened his eyes. He frowned and muttered to himself, “Looks like the Chaotic Deity has really perished. Who is the Dark Forbidden Lord? He’s actually so powerful.”
 He had once suspected that Han Jue was the Dark Forbidden Lord, or that Han Jue’s master was the Dark Forbidden Lord. Now, he didn’t think so anymore. Because the Chaotic Deity was too powerful!
 The Chaotic Deity who controlled the Chaotic Order was a true Great Dao Divine Spirit. Even if the Heavenly Dao Sages came to the Chaos, they had to follow the rules. With the death of such an extraordinary existence, the Evil Heavenly Emperor first thought of the long-lost Dao Ancestor.
 Only the Dao Ancestor could kill him! “Your Majesty, should we take action? This is the best opportunity for the Heavenly Court to recruit troops!” The black shadow asked.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor said, “There’s no hurry. We’ll take action when the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End is completely chaotic. How about those Little Heavenly Dao?”
 The black shadow replied, “After the Chaotic Deity died, the Inauspicious Evil that restricted the Little Heavenly Dao all surged towards the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End.
 The providence of the Little Heavenly Dao is rapidly increasing.” “Where’s the Ancient Desolate?”
 “It’s said that more than ten Transcendent Dao Expert are guarding it. The Inauspicious Evil and the Dao Devils are all rushing to the Ancient Desolate like mad. Your Majesty, what is hidden in the Ancient Desolate?”
 The black shadow was very curious. The situation was too abnormal.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor did not answer, but his eyes revealed worry. “By the way, recently, two Heavenly Dao lifeforms have trespassed into the Heavenly Court’s territory.
 I’ve already made a move to capture them. The providence of these two is not simple. They are very similar to the Chaotic Fiendcelestials. I don’t dare to kill them easily. Your Majesty, please make a decision.” The black shadow saw that the Evil Heavenly Emperor did not want to reveal anything and changed the topic. “Oh? Chaotic Fiendcelestials? Bring them here.”
 “Yes!”
 The black shadow vanished. Five minutes later, the black shadow appeared in front of the Evil Heavenly Emperor. He waved his right hand, and two figures fell to the ground. They were Han Tuo and Yi Tian.
 The two of them were wrapped in a black aura and could not break free. Yi Tian cursed. “What are you doing? If you want to kill or torture me, say something!” Han Tuo looked around warily, his gaze landing on the Evil Heavenly Emperor. The Evil Heavenly Emperor’s appearance was clearly not righteous, making him even more nervous.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor frowned when he saw Han Tuo.
 He waved his hand and said, “Black Heaven General, leave first.” “Yes!”
 The black shadow vanished again.
 Yi Tian also looked nervously at the Evil Heavenly Emperor. He could sense that he was different from the enemies he had encountered in the past.
 Profound and mysterious! Han Tuo gritted his teeth and said, “Senior, we just accidentally entered your territory. We have no ill intentions. Why are you holding onto us and not letting go?”
 He had no choice but to bow his head. The Evil Heavenly Emperor asked, “What’s your name?”
 Han Tuo replied, “My name is Tang Sanzang.” Yi Tian glared at him.
 Taking advantage of me?
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor smiled, and the terrifying aura around him retracted.
 He’s really similar to that kid. Be it his looks or his mouth. The Evil Heavenly Emperor’s lips curled up slightly.
 He slowly stood up and said, “Since you’re here, don’t even think about leaving. From today onwards, the two of you will serve me!”
