 It was unknown how long the humans and Heavenly Court would fight.
 “I’ve been too bored recently. I don’t even have a target to curse. Sigh, the Dark Forbidden Lord is about to retire.”
 Han Jue sighed and slowly stood up.
 He prepared to go out and preach the Dao to help his disciples improve their cultivation.
 Unknowingly, more than seventy years passed.
 [Detected that you are 7,000 years old and your life has taken another step forward. You have the following choices:]
 [1: Enter the calamity immediately and fight with the Sages. You can obtain a chance to upgrade the system, a Supreme Treasure, a Great Dao Fragment, and a Mystical Power inheritance.)
 [2: Cultivate in a low-profile manner and stay away from trouble. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment and a random natural treasure.]
 Seven thousand years old.
 He wasn’t far from ten thousand years old.
 Han Jue sighed. He didn’t expect to be so old already.
 He silently chose the second option.
 (You chose to cultivate in a low-profile manner and obtained a Great Dao Fragment and a random natural treasure.]
 [Congratulations on obtaining the Chaotic Origin Stone.)
 (Chaotic Origin Stone: The first stone that was created at the beginning of Chaos. It can produce an endless stream of Chaotic Qi. It contains the power of creation that gives birth to all things.]
 Han Jue’s eyes lit up.
 What a treasure!
 This was even more valuable than the Fusang Tree!
 Han Jue immediately took out the Chaotic Origin Stone. This stone looked like a ball of water. Its shape kept changing. It was murky and shiny.
 After thinking about it, Han Jue threw the Chaotic Origin Stone into the depths of his soul, into the world of stars.
 He had always wanted to turn this world of stars into a true Heavenly Dao world.
 In addition, the Chaotic Qi produced by the Chaotic Origin Stone might be able to help the Fiendcelestial Qi evolve.
 Han Jue hoped to nurture more Chaotic Fiendcelestials.
 If his world of stars could develop into an Immortal World, wouldn’t he be the Heavenly Dao?
 If someone became a Sage, wouldn’t he surpass the Heavenly Dao?
 This plan seemed impossible, but Han Jue felt that it was feasible.
 The Stellar Primordial Body was a powerful physique that surpassed Chaos. Even a Chaotic Fiendcelestial might not be able to compare to him.
 Anything was possible with the Chaotic Origin Stone!
 Han Jue continued cultivating and observing the Chaotic Origin Stone.
 The stone continued to produce Chaotic Qi, and most of it was absorbed by the three balls of Fiendcelestial Qi. Soon, Han Jue discovered that the Chaotic Origin Stone stopped producing Chaotic Qi because the demand for it was too high, and it couldn’t withstand the output.
 Han Jue had no choice but to move the Chaotic Origin Stone further away.
 Not long after, the Chaotic Origin Stone continued to produce Chaotic Qi.
 “Looks like I have to wait for a while longer.”
 Han Jue thought silently.
 His Stellar Primordial Body could produce Chaotic Qi. To be precise, it was a higher-level nebulous Primordial Qi, but it was slower.
 Han Jue felt that it was mainly because his cultivation was not high enough.
 When he became a Sage, the speed at which he nurtured nebulous Primordial Qi would definitely be terrifying.
 “In short, my future is limitless.”
 Han Jue thought proudly. With the resources he had now, he didn’t need to pursue opportunities at all.
 If he cultivated quietly, he would become a terrifying existence that even Sages couldn’t imagine! “Continue being steady, I will become the strongest sooner or later!”
 Han Jue silently encouraged himself.
 Soon, he entered his cultivation state.
 Han Jue had been paying attention to the passage of time, but the Hidden Sect disciples had already forgotten. They even ignored the fact that the Immeasurable Calamity was ongoing outside.
 Apart from cultivation, their main topic was competitiveness.
 After Dao Comprehension Sword, Chu Shiren also reached the Emperor Realm.
 Zhou Mingyue was bitter. In the past, Chu Shiren had only suppressed him by a realm. Now that he was using all his strength, he couldn’t catch up at all.
 Chu Shiren no longer kept asking people not to cultivate. Other than telling everyone his knowledge, most of the topics were about discussing the Dao and how to become stronger. Apart from Chu Shiren, Jiang Yi’s talent had also completely erupted. He had broken through not long ago and had already reached the Rank Four Immortal Emperor Realm.
 Although he had successfully broken through, Jiang Yi was not excited. He was still filled with urgency.
 Li Yao was already attempting to break through to the Rank Three Immortal Emperor Realm!
 This woman was too powerful! Apart from cultivation, Li Yao’s combat talent was also very strong.
 Almost everyone agreed that Li Yao was the female version of Han Jue!
 Most importantly, Li Yao wasn’t Han Jue’s disciple and did not call him master. This relationship was worth thinking about.
 Under Li Yao’s lead, the entire Hidden Sect was filled with a competitive cultivation culture.
 The Black Hell Demon Lord felt the worst. Being chased up by juniors meant that his status could not be preserved.
 Although it was uncomfortable, he had no choice. His potential was indeed inferior to these few.
 Apart from Li Yao, Tu Ling’er and Murong Qi were also very fierce.
Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com The two of them liked to rely on battles to break through. They comprehended in battle and were natural battle maniacs. Next was the Chaotic Gourd Spirit, Han Eight. His strength had already left the other seven brothers behind. He was advancing towards the first-tier group of the Hidden Sect disciples.
 The cultivation levels of the ten thousand Nether Race members were almost identical. They were even slightly inferior to the Grand Unity Golden Immortal.
 In short, everyone in the Hidden Sect was very satisfied with their current life and experienced the benefits of cultivation.
 The Hidden Sect’s overall strength was also rapidly increasing.
 The Black Hell Demon Lord joked that if the Hidden Sect entered the Immortal World after the calamity ended, it would definitely stir up a commotion.
 Another thirty years passed.
 The hundred-year competition had just ended. Some were happy, while others were worried. Han Jue was still far from the late-stage Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm, but he was not discouraged. After all, his speed was already fast enough. After reaching the Zenith Heaven Realm, who could break through a minor realm in a thousand years?
 Oh.
 There was someone indeed.
 Li Daokong!
 However, it was the Immeasurable Calamity now. Li Daokong relied on his great providence to constantly grow.
 On this day.
 Han Jue was teasing the Strange Deity and enjoying the massage when he suddenly sensed the Chaotic Domain’s summoning.
 It was a new fortuitous encounter.
 Han Jue jumped into the Chaotic Domain.
 Only one person was waiting for him in the Chaotic Domain, Zhao Xuanyuan. Han Jue asked in surprise, “Where’s Dao Sovereign?”
 Zhao Xuanyuan replied, “Daoist Brother and Zhou Fan obtained a huge opportunity not long ago. I parted ways with them and have already returned to the Human Race.”
 Han Jue lost his interest immediately.
 Although Dao Sovereign always troubled him, he would also bring benefits.
 As for Zhao Xuanyuan, Han Jue was not close to him.
 Zhao Xuanyuan saw that he was bored and hurriedly said, “Senior, I’m not here to trouble you. I want to…”
 Senior?
 Didn’t he call Han Jue ‘Fellow Daoist’ before?
 Han Jue was alerted.
 Could it be that a Sage was behind this?
 Now, the Heavenly Dao Sages were even thinking of ways to form a relationship with Han Jue. At this juncture, Zhao Xuanyuan came looking for him…
 “I want to become the disciple of your sect!” said Zhao Xuanyuan after mustering his courage.
 Han Jue asked in surprise, “Who told you I have a sect?”
 “Back then, didn’t you ask Daoist Brother to
 go?”
 “I was just casually joking. My cultivation level is inferior to yours.”
 “Impossible! You give me an unfathomable feeling. My instincts are very accurate. I’ve never misjudged anyone. Perhaps this is my talent.”
 Zhao Xuanyuan stared at him and said seriously.
 Han Jue didn’t agree immediately.
 Zhao Xuanyuan said, “I heard from Dao Sovereign that you don’t want to enter the calamity. Don’t worry, I definitely won’t let you be involved in karma with the humans.”
