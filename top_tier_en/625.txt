 “Who did that Shi Dudao’s Primordial Purple Qi come from? It can only be from Empress Nüwa and Fuxitian. The former’s Primordial Purple Qi has long disappeared, and the latter died in the Dark Forbidden Zone. The Primordial Purple Qi can’t be found at all,” the South Extreme Heavenly Venerate said in a low voice. He scanned the other Sages and continued, “In that case, Shi Dudao’s Primordial Purple Qi can only come from Empress Nüwa. Someone among us must be secretly supporting Shi Dudao.”
 Sect Master Tian Jue, Emperor Xiao, Qiu Xilai, Heavenly Venerate Wufa, and Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du were silent.
 The atmosphere became subtle.
 Emperor Xiao said, “Even if someone is plotting, it’s impossible for them to be honest. What we should find out now is why Fang Liang can attain the Dao.”
 “Fang Liang’s Primordial Purple Qi can’t be from Han Jue, right? Ever since Fang Liang established the Heavenly Dao, his providence has become further and further away from the Hidden Sect. It’s equivalent to betraying it. It shouldn’t be Han Jue. Even if it’s him, where did he get so many Primordial Purple Qi?”
 The Sages frowned. They suddenly couldn’t see through the Heavenly Dao’s situation.
 Ever since the Dark Sage King appeared, they had felt very passive and had lost the absolute control of the past Heavenly Dao Sages.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “There are only nine Primordial Purple Qi. This saying actually comes from the Dao Ancestor. It just so happens to correspond to the nine Heavenly Dao Sages. However, have you ever thought that before the birth of the Heavenly Dao, there was the Primordial Purple Qi? Why are the two so coincidental?”
 Heavenly Venerate Wufa asked, “You mean that there are more than nine Primordial Purple Qi?”
 “That’s the only way.” Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du sighed. He began to feel helpless.
 After coming to the Heavenly Dao, he wanted to show off and lead the Heavenly Dao to become stronger. However, now, even the Sage position had become mysterious. He felt that he had already fallen into a game of chess that he couldn’t escape.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du continued, “Did you sense that something was wrong with the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End? We killed the Dark Sage King, but the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End was not very happy. They even treated us coldly?”
 The Sages were moved.
 The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate’s eyes widened. “You too?”
 Emperor Xiao frowned. The other Sages also had ugly expressions.
 They were good at plotting and could easily figure it out.
 Thinking about it carefully, it made sense. No matter how strong the Dark Sage King was, he wasn’t stronger than the mighty figures in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End.
 If those mighty figures really had the intention, they could directly attack him!
 Why create a Heavenly Dao calamity?
 At this moment.
 Great Loose Heaven’s voice came from outside the hall, “Sages, Great Loose Heaven requests an audience!”
 His tone was very impolite, making one feel that he was restraining his anger.
 Sect Master Tian Jue said, “How can we answer to him? The Heavenly Dao Providence Board has become a joke now. It’s also slapping our faces.” Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said calmly, “Let him in.”
 …
 In the Daoist temple of the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 Han Jue had a strange expression. He was also puzzled. How did Fang Liang succeed?
 The Primordial Purple Qi he had given Li Daokong was obtained from Li Muyi’s calculations. He had yet to use the Great Dao Purple Qi he had obtained from the system.
 Could it be that there was more than one Primordial Purple Qi?
 In the past, when the Dao Ancestor was still around, the Heavenly Dao had nine Heavenly Dao Sages.
 What about the Dao Ancestor?
 Dao Ancestor definitely had one since he was also a Sage!
 “I want to know how many Primordial Purple Qi there are?” Han Jue asked silently.
 [Ten billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [49]
 So much!
 Han Jue’s eyes widened. He continued to ask, “Other than those I know, where are the remaining Primordial Purple Qi?”
 ‘ [It involves an existence that surpasses the system’s limits. It cannot be deduced.]
 Dao Ancestor!
 Han Jue remained silent.
 Could it be that the Dao Ancestor was like him, silently nurturing a transcendent force?
 It was very likely that when the Dao Sect broke up in the past, the Dao Ancestor could clearly stop them, but he didn’t. His mentality was probably the same as his.
 Han Jue was nurturing the Fiendcelestial force. There was also the Hidden Sect. Ji Xianshen and Fang Liang had broken up in the Heavenly Race, so he didn’t take it to heart. They were on | different levels and had different goals.
 Han Jue suddenly felt that the Dao Ancestor was plotting!
 No one knew why the Dao Ancestor had disappeared. He was clearly still alive, but he had never appeared. He had let the mighty figures of the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End scheme against the Heavenly Dao.
 What was he plotting?
 Han Jue felt the pressure.
 If the Dao Ancestor wanted to kill him, the Dao Field couldn’t stop him.
 Han Jue took a deep breath and adjusted his state of mind.
 The Dao Ancestor had no reason to kill him.
 Han Jue suspected that his variable identity was deliberately arranged by the Dao Ancestor to restrain the other Sages.
 Knowing that he was a variable, the Sages first tried to rope him in and then targeted him.
 “Forget it. I’ll just work hard to become stronger.”
 Han Jue thought silently. The Dao Ancestor didn’t appear, perhaps because he was restricted by an unknown existence and might be having a hard time.
 Yeah.
 Hopefully.
 After Fang Liang became a Sage, the Heavenly Dao Providence Board became a joke. All living beings no longer trusted it. The mighty figures at the top of the list gave up fighting for providence.
 The number one Great Loose Heaven had been beaten to attain the Dao. It was truly ridiculous!
 Fang Liang’s Heavenly Dao Sect quickly expanded. His disciples quickly exceeded ten million. They were all living beings with cultivation levels and formed a powerful force in the Immortal World.
 In contrast, the Heavenly Race was silent because of Fang Liang’s rise.
 The immortals were very afraid of offending him, so they didn’t dare to support Ji Xianshen.
 No matter how strong Ji Xianshen was, he was only a pawn supported by a Sage. Fang Liang was a Sage!
 Time passed.
 As the Heavenly Race fell silent, many forces suppressed by them began to stir again. The situation in the Immortal World changed.
 At the same time.
 In the depths of the distant Dark Forbidden Zone, Han Tuo and Yi Tian were experiencing a life and death pursuit.
 The two of them moved quickly.
 They stopped under a huge meteor.
 Yi Tian took out two talismans and stuck them on Han Tuo and himself.
 The two of them held their breaths and stayed close to the meteor, not daring to breathe.
 A terrifying figure flew out from the darkness. Its body was shaped like a rotting fish. In its bloody mouth, every tooth was as big as a mountain. It had four pairs of bone wings and as it flapped, it stirred up a murky wind.
 Not sensing Han Tuo and Yi Tian, it quickly left this area.
 Han Tuo heaved a sigh of relief. He turned to look at Yi Tian and cursed with a voice transmission. “How did you provoke it?”
 If not for Han Tuo arriving in time, Yi Tian might have died in the stomach of the dark beast.
 In order to find Yi Tian, Han Tuo had spent too much time. He had experienced many difficulties along the way and couldn’t help but feel a little resentment.
 Yi Tian had an innocent expression as he sent a voice transmission, “It stole my treasure!”
 “What treasure?”
 “A purple qi. I can feel that by absorbing that purple qi, I will be reborn!”
 “What purple qi? Could it be the legendary Primordial Purple Qi used to attain the Dao?”
 Han Tuo’s tone was filled with mockery. He knew Yi Tian. This fellow was actually fighting with the dark beast just now. He clearly could not win, but he still insisted on pestering it.
 Stupid!
