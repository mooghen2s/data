 They were very familiar with this Spirit Qi increase. They had felt it before on Hidden Sect Island.
 They guessed that Han Jue was using a Mystical Power, so they were not surprised.
 After confirming that the Dao Field had moved out of Hidden Sect Island, Han Jue suddenly thought of a bold idea.
 Since the Dao Field could be moved now, could he move it wherever he went in the future?
 No.
 A hundred billion years was too much.
 Han Jue still had to use the derivation function usually. He might even have to curse the enemy in the future. With so many aspects added together, there were too many places to consume lifespan. He couldn’t develop a habit.
 “Can the Dao Field keep moving?” Han Jue asked in his mind.
 [Every time you change the Dao Field location, the cost of lifespan will double. The cooldown time is 100 years.]
 It would double?
 Han Jue made up his mind not to move the Dao Field easily in the future.
 Then, he continued cultivating.
 The Hundred Peak Immortal River’s Spirit Qi and Connate Qi continued to increase. Ten years later, they reached their peak.
 Although it wasn’t as good as Hidden Sect Island, it was still much stronger than before.
 Han Jue also moved the Fusang Tree out. It was located between the mountains and was majestic and towering into the clouds.
 Zhao Yun and the new guard Dian Wei stayed in front of the spatial vortex. Lü Bu and Ma Chao guarded the east and west border of the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 After the Fusang Tree appeared, the Black Hell Chicken, Ah Da, and Xiao Er immediately moved to the tree. They were still used to staying on it.
 This time, it was completely stable.
 Han Jue placed Hidden Sect Island into the world of stars in the depths of his soul and continued cultivating.
 He wanted to reach the Pseudo-Sage Realm as soon as possible!
 The Immortal World after the Heavenly Dao restarted was extremely lonely. The blood traces from the battle had yet to completely dissipate. After all, the cultivation levels of the living beings who participated in the calamity were not weak. To mortals, their blood could be considered holy and evil objects, depending on who viewed it. The world couldn’t erase them in a short period of time.
 In the blink of an eye.
 Thirty years passed.
 With a loud boom, the world shook!
 Han Jue, who was cultivating, opened his eyes. His gaze passed through the Daoist temple and the mountains. He saw a huge finger descending from the sky and crashing towards the end of the horizon.
 It was a human finger that was tens of thousands of feet long. At the end, dense white bones could be seen.
 Han Jue showed a frown.
 Pseudo-Sage’s finger!
 This aura was much stronger than a Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal.
 In next to no time, the finger vanished at the end of the horizon. After that, a terrifying gust of wind swept over, and the mountains along the way were crushed into pieces. It swept out for a myriad of kilometers, also affecting the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 The Dao Field’s array formation was automatically activated. The strong wind was blocked, forming a huge and visible wind wall. It was extremely spectacular. The disciples of the Hidden Sect and the Nether Race could see it clearly.
 “What’s that?”
 “Whose finger fell off?”
 “Looks like there’s a huge battle in the sky.” “If we get hit…”
 “When did Sect Master set up the array formation in the Hundred Peak Immortal River? I actually didn’t sense it…”
 As the disciples of the Hidden Sect discussed, many huge limbs appeared in the sky. They scattered like rain, and blood dyed the sea of clouds.
 Han Jue narrowed his eyes. He could sense that the auras of these limbs were all different. The strongest was a Pseudo-Sage, and the weakest was a Grand Unity Golden Immortal.
 Why is there such a huge quantity?
 Han Jue looked at the sky. After passing through the 30th Heaven, he saw a mysterious black-robed man whose face he couldn’t see clearly waving his sleeve. Countless limbs fell out of his sleeve and scattered on the ground.
 His direction was different. He clearly wanted to plot against the entire Heavenly Dao.
 Han Jue asked secretly, “Who is this person?”
 (3 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 It looked to be a Sage!
 [Emperor Xiao: Cultivation unknown. Heavenly Dao Sage, disciple of the Dao Ancestor, one of the Ancestors of the Devil Race]
 Heavenly Dao Sage!
 Han Jue frowned. This person was actually one of the Ancestors of the Devil Race, and he had even become a disciple of the Dao Ancestor?
 The known Heavenly Dao Sages were Nüwa, Fuxitian, the South Extreme Heavenly Venerate, Qiu Xilai, Sect Master Tian Jue, Sage Fated Secrets, Sage Jin’an, and Emperor Xiao. Only one more was missing to form the nine.
 “I want to know, why did Emperor Xiao this?” Han Jue asked in his mind.
 (4 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Why did it cost a billion more?
 Han Jue chose to continue.
 Immediately after, he entered the illusion.
 This was a dark hall. Two figures sat facing each other. One of the figures was obviously Emperor Xiao. The other was several times larger than Emperor Xiao and was covered in black flames.
 “The Heavenly Dao has been restarted. Have you prepared the remains you gathered?” The black flaming figure asked.
 Emperor Xiao replied, “Yes.”
 “Yes, sprinkle it on the various worlds of the Heavenly Dao.” “Why?”
 “These remnant bodies are all living beings that contain overwhelming negative karma and resentment. After the Heavenly Dao restarted, they were already abandoned by it. Taking advantage of the fact that the Heavenly Dao is evolving, we can sprinkle them down on the heavens and turn them into cursed objects. They can curse the Heavenly Dao and prepare for the appearance of the Devil Race in the future.”
 “Will the Sages stop me?”
 “I will lead them away.”
 “Alright!”
 The scene shattered.
 Han Jue frowned. It was the Devil Race again.
 He looked up again. Emperor Xiao was still scattering the remains. It was hard to imagine how many corpses this fellow had gathered.
 Emperor Xiao suddenly met his gaze.
 Han Jue immediately looked away.
 Above the 30th Heaven, Emperor Xiao frowned.
 “Strange, I can’t see through that person’s Dao Field,” Emperor Xiao muttered.
 He pinched his fingers to deduce, but his expression became stranger.
 This person had so little karma…
 It was inferior to even a mortal!
 How had he cultivated to such a realm?
 Emperor Xiao was interested in Han Jue. At the same time, he had a feeling that this person would be an obstacle to the rise of the Devil Race.
 [Emperor Xiao has a favorable impression of you. Current favorability: 0.5 stars]
 0.5 stars? Han Jue looked at the notification in front of him with a strange expression. This was the first time he had encountered 0.5 stars.
 Such a low favorability could very well become hatred.
 However, Han Jue was not worried. If Emperor Xiao couldn’t enter the Immortal World with his main body, he would not be a threat.
Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com Emperor Xiao had scattered too many bodies. Han Jue couldn’t be bothered to stop him. It was a thankless task.
 He would leave it to future generations.
 When the Sages returned, they should be able to think of a way to deal with it.
 Then, Han Jue closed his eyes and continued cultivating
 Five minutes later, the huge quantity of bodily remains stopped pouring down. Peace returned to the Immortal World.
 ice
 In the blink of an eye.
 Thirty-two years passed.
 (Qiu Xilai wants to visit you in your dreams. Do you want to continue?]
 This notification began to flood the screen.
 Han Jue cursed silently. This guy was mental!
 He chose to accept the dream.
 It was still the same familiar hall. Qiu Xilai was the first to speak. “Have you seen ruined bodies descending from the heavens?”
 Han Jue nodded.
 Crap.
 Does this fellow want me to clean it up?
 “Just pretend you didn’t see it. Cultivate as usual. Don’t tell the other Sages about this,” Qiu Xilai continued.
 Han Jue was stunned.
 Don’t tell the other Sages?
 This dog is colluding with the devils!
 Han Jue said, “Other than you, no Sage has contacted me for the time being.”
