 A line of words appeared in front of Han Jue. [Detected that Primordial Origin and the Heavenly Dao reject each other, so it can’t enter the Heavenly Dao. Primordial Origin doesn’t have any ill intentions towards the Heavenly Dao, either.] No ill intentions? Then, why was he here? Han Jue continued to derive and deducted another 200 billion years of his lifespan. [He is avoiding a powerful existence. As for what it is, the system cannot derive it.) So, he was here to hide.
 Han Jue hesitated to establish a connection with Primordial Origin. Once this fellow successfully transformed, he would be the same as him.
 No.
 Wouldn’t this expose that he was a Primordial Fiendcelestial?
 In any case, this fellow did not want to harm the Heavenly Dao. It didn’t matter to him.
 After Han Jue made up his mind, he looked away. The appearance of Primordial Origin made Han Jue feel a sense of danger. He still had to speed up the nurturing of the Chaotic Fiendcelestials. Han Jue called Great Loose Heaven into the Daoist temple.
 Great Loose Heaven’s cultivation was already at the perfected Pseudo-Sage Realm. It was very suitable for him to directly transform into a Chaotic Fiendcelestial. It just so happened that Han Jue did not want to give him the Great Dao Purple Qi.
 He suppressed his excitement and greeted Han
 Jue.
 He had been in the Hundred Peak Immortal River for a period of time; Han Jue finally called for him. Could it be to attain the Dao?
 Great Loose Heaven’s heart that had experienced the vicissitudes of time began to tremble. The first thing Han Jue said was, “Great Loose Heaven, is your goal to be a Sage or higher?”
 Great Loose Heaven was stunned.
 Although he was a mighty figure of the Immortal World, Great Loose Heaven didn’t know about the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End and the extraordinary person hidden in the depths of the Chaos.
 Even if he had gone to the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End, he couldn’t come into contact with such an existence. Great Loose Heaven asked carefully, “What do you mean?”
 Han Jue said, “I’ll give you two choices now. One is to attain the Dao and become a Heavenly Dao Sage. But this is the end. Two, I’ll give you a supreme bloodline and help you gain the potential to surpass the Sages. “There’s an even wider world outside the Heavenly Dao. Do you know how I obtained my status? If I was only an ordinary Sage, how can the other Sages give the Hidden Sect a chance to develop? It’s only because I’ve already surpassed the Heavenly Dao Sages. Even if the current Sages join forces, they won’t be my match!” Han Jue’s tone was firm and confident. Great Loose Heaven was fascinated. “What price does the second choice require?”
 Han Jue said, “Pain. The process of replacing the bloodline is very painful. In addition, I’ll move you to another place to cultivate diligently later. It’s equivalent to losing your freedom. I’ll only let you go after the Great Dao Calamity ends.”
 Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity…
 Great Loose Heaven was secretly shocked. Although he didn’t understand what the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity was, when he thought of the Heavenly Devil Calamity and the Flame Race’s calamity, it was obvious that the Heavenly Dao was not as safe as before. Great Loose Heaven fell into a dilemma.
 Han Jue wasn’t in a hurry. He believed that Great Loose Heaven would make the right choice.
 If not for the fact that it was very difficult to get Creation Spirit Stones, how could Han Jue choose Great Loose Heaven? This was a huge opportunity! After a long while…
 Great Loose Heaven looked up and said, “I choose the second path! Sect Master, please bestow me a supreme bloodline!”
Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com His bloodline potential was already top-notch in the Heavenly Dao, but he believed that Han Jue would not lie to him.
 Han Jue waved his hand and took Great Loose Heaven into the Primordial World. He then directly crushed his body with the power of Freedom and extracted his soul. Great Loose Heaven was shocked, but he did not shout or scream. Instead, he waited nervously.
 Han Jue took him to the Fiendcelestial Qi. Looking at the balls of Fiendcelestial Qi in front of him, Great Loose Heaven’s soul trembled.
 He felt like he was facing his natural enemy. A fatal sense of danger constantly corroded his heart. Han Jue hesitated for a while and decided to give the Shadow Flood Fiendcelestial to Great Loose Heaven.
 The Shadow Flood Fiendcelestial had the same effect as the Avatar Fiendcelestial. It could split into countless Great Dao shadows and was one of the earliest Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols that Han Jue had comprehended.
 The fusion process was even more painful than Great Loose Heaven imagined, but in order not to embarrass himself in front of Han Jue, he still endured it. In the blink of an eye. Another thousand years passed. Seeing that Great Loose Heaven had already adapted to the power of the Shadow Flood Fiendcelestial, Han Jue no longer used his Dharmic powers to protect him.
 He turned his attention back to reality and started cultivating. He had been in seclusion for a thousand years.
 When he opened his eyes again, Han Jue stretched lazily. Such a cultivation pattern had already become a habit. If he didn’t cultivate for a thousand years, he would feel uncomfortable all over. Two thousand years passed. Dozens of new worlds had already appeared at the border of the two worlds. The Heavenly Race had also completely adapted to the days in the netherworld.
 Han Jue looked at the Immortal World and decided to choose some Fiendcelestial candidates. Previously, the Flame Race had attacked the Immortal World. In terms of high-level combat strength, the Immortal World was already behind. Han Jue had a feeling. The Flame Race was not the strongest race in the Chaos. His gaze landed on the Reroll World and on the Jade Pure Sacred Sect.
 After more than a hundred thousand years, the Jade Pure Sacred Sect was still around. It was the strongest Holy Land in the Reroll World. It was all thanks to the White-Robed Buddha’s support.
 However, the Jade Pure Sacred Sect was no longer the same as before. The old location of the Jade Pure Sacred Sect was already barren, far from the current Jade Pure Sacred Sect.
 Han Jue suddenly wanted to take a walk. He sent out a soul thought and transformed into a clone to descend on the old location of the Jade Pure Sacred Sect.
 The mountains here were undulating. The eighteen peaks of the Jade Pure Sect were no longer there. There were even very few people here.
 As he walked in the forest, the sunlight shone on Han Jue through the cracks among the leaves. Images of the past appeared in his mind. For some reason, Han Jue thought of the previous Sect Master of the Jade Pure Sacred Sect, Li Qingzi. “Are you satisfied with the current Jade Pure Sacred Sect?” Han Jue muttered in an emotional tone. Unfortunately, the Heavenly Dao had restarted and Li Qingzi’s soul had long dissipated. He didn’t have a chance to see the Jade Pure Sacred Sect again. Han Jue didn’t use his Sage Sense to scan the surroundings. Instead, he blocked his senses and walked around as if he was traveling the forest. Half a day later.
 Han Jue stuffed a manual into a crack in a mountain. It was the Six Paths of Reincarnation Technique.
 If someone could obtain this manual and enter Han Jue’s vision, he could become a Fiendcelestial candidate.
 His soul thought returned to his body. Han Jue’s gaze turned to the Immortal World.
 It was better to choose from the Immortal World. The growth period of living beings in the mortal world was too long. For example, Yang Du was still far from becoming a Pseudo-Sage. For some reason, Han Jue suddenly thought of Han Ming. After parting with Han Tuo, Han Ming cultivated in seclusion alone. He had not come out of seclusion for more than ten thousand years. Han Jue had severed the karma between them. However, Han Ming treated Han Tuo very well in this life, which made him feel better. This kid’s favorability towards Han Jue was already six stars. He shouldn’t stab him in the back.
 The current Han Ming was already at the Six Mystic Divine Origin Realm but couldn’t break through to the Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm.
 This was the limit of his potential. He wouldn’t advance unless he became the disciple of a mighty figure.
 Han Jue sent him a voice transmission.
 Han Ming, who was cultivating in the cave abode, suddenly opened his eyes. “Han Ming.” Han Jue’s voice sounded again, making Han Ming understand that he was not hallucinating. This voice… Han Ming couldn’t forget it!
 Han Ming suppressed the huge waves in his heart and asked, “What is it?”
 “Want to join the Hidden Sect?” “You need me?”
 “No. I’m just giving you an opportunity.” “Then forget it. I don’t want to cause trouble for you. I already owe you a lot.” Han Ming shook his head. He had also hated Han Jue’s ruthlessness in the past, but if not for him, the Heavenly Emperor wouldn’t have helped him reincarnate. Therefore, he only felt reverence and gratitude towards Han Jue and didn’t even dare to approach him.
