 How many mighty cultivators were hidden in the Hidden Sect?
 The happiest was naturally Ji Xianshen. The mighty figures above the Deity Realm were usually busy cultivating, so Immortal Emperors were the core force. The Hidden Sect had given them thousands of Immortal Emperors before. The Heavenly Race had more than twenty thousand Immortal Emperors, and they were the number one in the Immortal World.
 Ji Xianshen didn’t disappoint the ten thousand Immortal Emperors of the Hidden Sect. After arranging them, he started a war.
 These Immortal Emperors had cultivated diligently in the Hundred Peak Immortal River for tens of thousands of years. They had finally come out and naturally did not want to continue cultivating. They wanted to pursue other things and enrich themselves.
 Wasn’t cultivation meant to be stronger than others?
 It was best to realize the value of one’s strength in war!
 For a time, the Heavenly Race fought everywhere. More and more factions lowered their heads.
 A thousand years later.
 The Heavenly Race had officially declared war on the demons. The Golden Crow Demon Emperor had a backbone and fearlessly accepted the challenge.
 The battle between the two races was definitely the most intense battle after the Heavenly Dao restarted. It spread throughout dozens of regions.
 On a hill.
 Han Tuo and Yi Tian stood side by side as they looked at the sky. They could see immortals as majestic as mountains suppressing the demons.
 Han Tuo sighed. “Why? You’re not a demon yourself. Why are you fighting for the demons?”
 Yi Tian smiled. “I’m not fighting for the demons. I’m just using their name to fight for providence. If I’m alone, I’ll probably make countless enemies. Now that I’m with the demons, the Heavenly Race still wants to recruit me.”
 Han Tuo rolled his eyes. “You really want to learn from the Great Sage Heaven’s Equal and become the horse keeper of the Immortal Gods?”
 Yi Tian glared at him. “What do you mean by being the horse keeper of the Immortal Gods? I’m their true master! This was destined from the beginning!”
 “Hehe, you make it sound like you’re really the Son of the Heavenly Dao.”
 “I told you long ago, but you didn’t believe me.”
 “If you are the Son of the Heavenly Dao, why do you need my help occasionally?”
 “It’s necessary to suffer. You’re my brother. If you don’t save me, who will? When I become the master of the Heavenly Dao, I’ll let you be on the same level as me!”
 “Well said. I’m not that ambitious.”
 “To be honest, why are you cultivating?”
 Facing Yi Tian’s question, Han Tuo fell silent.
 Any living being had its own goals in cultivation. Han Tuo recalled himself and found it difficult to answer.
 He couldn’t help but recall his conversation with his father many years ago. He could no longer remember his father’s appearance, but that night, his father had taught him a lot. Han Tuo took a deep breath and said, “I just want to cultivate. If I’m strong, I’ll definitely help the Human Race, but what I want the most is to be the strongest!”
 He thought of how he had been rejected by the Sect Master of the Hidden Sect. He thought of his wife’s death and the expectations of his parents. His eyes became firm. “As expected of my brother. It’s just as I wanted. You can leave first. Don’t worry, I won’t die here. The Heavenly Race can’t and won’t kill me.” Yi Tian patted his shoulder and smiled.
 Han Tuo frowned and hesitated for a moment before nodding.
 He turned around and left, quickly flying towards the horizon.
 A voice sounded in his ears, “This kid might really be the Son of the Heavenly Dao. His fate is extremely strange. I can’t even see through him.”
 It was the Calamity’s Vengeful.
 Ever since he subdued the Calamity’s Vengeful, Han Tuo had relied on it many times to turn the situation around. The cultivation of a Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal was absolutely a top expert in the current Immortal World. Even a Pseudo-Sage couldn’t insta-kill a Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal.
 Han Tuo asked in his mind, “Where should we go next?”
 Calamity’s Vengeful said, “I think you need to resolve your inner problem. Otherwise, you will find it difficult to enter the Deity Realm.”
 “How?”
 “Go to the mortal world.”
 “Yes?”
 “Hehe, you’ll understand when you go.”
 Han Jue opened his eyes and smiled.
 He entered seclusion for another 1,300 years. He finally had the chance to break through!
 He did not immediately do it, though. Instead, he checked his emails and cared about his friends.
 Yes, not bad. No one died.
 Han Jue saw an email.
 (Your son Han Tuo has descended into the mortal world.)
 Why did this kid go to the mortal world?
 Han Jue immediately observed Han Tuo and raised his eyebrows.
 Han Tuo actually married and had children in the mortal world. He had a son and a daughter who were already four years old.
 Good kid, he actually imitated him.
 Han Tuo’s bloodline was already sealed. It fused with mortals and passed down to the next generation. Although his potential was stronger than mortals, it was not that world-shattering
 Han Jue wasn’t interested in his grandchildren. He watched for an hour and started to break through in seclusion.
 490 years later, Han Jue successfully broke through.
 This breakthrough took longer than before. This was normal. After all, this was the Sage Realm.
 Han Jue checked his attributes list.
 [Name: Han Jue]
 [Race: Primordial Fiendcelestial (Immeasurable Emperor)]
 (Cultivation: Late-stage Primordial Chaos Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm (Perfect Sage)]
 (Technique: Primordial Chaos Reincarnation Great Dao (Great Dao), Heavenly Cycle Body Tempering]
 (Great Dao: Great Dao of Life and Death, Great Dao of Karma, Great Dao of Extreme Origin)
 His lifespan was refreshed, increasing by nearly three times!
 More than twenty thousand years had passed since his last breakthrough.
Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m Unknowingly, Han Jue was already a 60,000-years-old antique.
 After breaking through, his Dharmic powers soared. It took him twenty years to consolidate his cultivation.
 He used a few months to raise all his Sword Dao Mystical Powers to the limit.
 Han Jue was about to cultivate the Grand Unity Aspect when an old immortal called him outside the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 The old immortal wore a white robe and had an immortal aura. Holding a horsetail whisk, he bowed towards the Hundred Peak Immortal River. “I’m the Golden Star Grand Immortal of the Heavenly Race. I’m here on the orders of the Ancestor to invite the Hidden Sect to participate in the Heavenly Peach Banquet.”
 His words were heard by all the disciples in the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 They were not unfamiliar with the Heavenly Race. The disciples who had left previously had all gone to reinforce the Heavenly Ancestor, so in their opinion, the Heavenly Race was a subsidiary force of the Hidden Sect.
 Han Jue’s voice sounded, “When?”
 “In a hundred years, in the 13th Heaven.”
 “Yes, I know.”
 “The Heavenly Race welcomes the Immeasurable Merit Divine Might Heavenly Sage.”
 The Golden Star Grand Immortal’s attitude was very humble, giving Han Jue enough face.
 Although he looked like this, his status in the Heavenly Race was not low.
 After waiting for a while and confirming that Han Jue didn’t give any instructions, the Golden Star Grand Immortal left.
 Han Jue called Li Xuan’ao over.
 Li Xuan’ao was still at the early-stage Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm and was already close to the mid-stage.
 “Bring two disciples to the Heavenly Peach Banquet in a hundred years. Come back after the banquet ends,” Han Jue instructed.
 Li Xuan’ao nodded. “Do I choose randomly? Or do I choose from the personal disciples?”
 “Choose from the in-name disciples.”
 “Understood.”
 Li Xuan’ao left.
 The reason why Han Jue chose from the in-name disciples was that he hoped to maintain the Hidden Sect’s power. The personal disciples would be the Hidden Sect’s face in the future and couldn’t be exposed early.
 After Li Xuan’ao left, Han Jue looked at the mortal world.
 Han Tuo was still living in that mortal world. His descendants had passed down from generation to generation and had already become an aristocratic family. However, Han Tuo kept a low profile. The development of the Han family was not too strong.
