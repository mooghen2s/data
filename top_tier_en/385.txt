 This fellow was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure every year and would occasionally be cursed. However, he was fine and had been wandering around.
 He was so reckless but actually admired Han Jue’s philosophy? Han Jue felt that it was ridiculous!
 After meeting Jiang Dugu, Han Jue felt that the Nine Nether Purgatory was becoming less and less safe.
 However, this place was suitable for him to cultivate. He could still stay here.
 He would definitely escape when he reached the Six Mystic Divine Origin!
 Time passed. Twenty-seven years passed. On this day.
 Han Jue was cultivating when he suddenly felt uneasy. He felt that something big was about to happen.
 He opened his eyes and thought to himself, “Why do I feel uneasy?”
 [A billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 A billion years!
 Something was wrong!
 Han Jue gritted his teeth and chose to continue.
 He entered the illusion.
 Numerous flaming figures were gathered in a hall that burned with flames, looking at a terrifying three-legged Golden Crow.
 Even if this three-legged Golden Crow was lying down, it was still tens of thousands of feet tall. There was a huge golden bell above its head.
 The three-legged Golden Crow muttered a mysterious incantation. The golden bell trembled slightly as strange words visible to the naked eye appeared and revolved around it. “Ancestor, please send your divine power to my Golden Crow Divine Clan to suppress all living beings!”
 The Three-legged Golden Crow began to repeat these words. Its voice grew louder and louder, echoing in the hall.
 Han Jue raised his eyebrows. What was this?
 The Chaotic Bell?
 In some novels, it was mentioned that the Golden Crow Ancestor, Eastern Emperor Tai Yi, wielded the Chaotic Bell which was also known as the Eastern Emperor Bell.
 However, in the legends, Eastern Emperor Tai Yi had other identities of all kinds. The only thing that could be certain was that he was definitely an ancient deity.
 Heavy panting sounded from the golden bell. It was terrifying
 The scene shattered!
 Han Jue’s consciousness returned to reality.
 He didn’t expect that after the Divine Palace and the Demon Court collapsed, more factions would rise.
 As this calamity continued, why were there more and more people? Han Jue was secretly glad that he didn’t stay in the Immortal World. It was really chaotic.
 At this moment…
 Han Jue felt the Heavenly Emperor’s divine sense coming from the Heavenly Dao Token.
 The Heavenly Emperor asked him not to contact him. Why was he taking the initiative to contact him now?
 It seemed that the Heavenly Emperor also sensed that the Golden Crow Divine Clan was about to cause trouble.
 Han Jue connected his divine sense and the Heavenly Emperor’s voice sounded, “You have to be careful of your Golden Crows. Di Lantian of the Golden Crow Divine Clan is preparing to summon the Primordial Golden Crow. At that time, the bloodline power of the Golden Crows will resonate and go berserk.”
 Eh?
 There’s such a method?
 Han Jue said, “Thank you for your reminder, Your Majesty. Will the Golden Crow Divine Clan target the Heavenly Court?”
 The Heavenly Emperor’s tone was a little solemn. “Yes. After all, they established the Demon Race’s Heavenly Court and have to eradicate us. There can only be one Heavenly Court in the world, but I’m not afraid!
 “The Immortal Heavenly Court has existed for longer than the Demon Heavenly Court. What haven’t we experienced?”
 Han Jue was relieved. Although the Heavenly Emperor was suspected to be bragging, it was fine as long as he didn’t lose his confidence.
 “Your Majesty, do you know about Jade Emperor Zhou Yan?” Han Jue pretended to ask casually.
 “Yes, he’s the third emperor of the Heavenly Court. Why are you asking about him?” “Nothing. I just heard Di Taibai mention Jade Emperor Zhou Yan before. He’s extremely respected. Now that Hao Tian has appeared, will Jade Emperor Zhou Yan make a comeback?”
 “Don’t worry. Jade Emperor Zhou Yan has a good relationship with me. I was able to ascend because of his support.”
 Eh?
 An ally?
 Han Jue was stunned.
 He originally thought that Jade Emperor Zhou Yan was a mysterious mastermind hiding in the dark. He didn’t expect him to be the backing of the Heavenly Court…
 The Heavenly Emperor smiled. “He’s very powerful. It’s precisely because he’s here that the Heavenly Court can be eternal.”
 “I see. I’m relieved.”
 “Mm.”
 After ending the conversation, Han Jue frowned.
 Immortal Emperor Samsara and the Heavenly Emperor were both subordinates of Jade Emperor Zhou Yan, but Immortal Emperor Samsara and the Heavenly Emperor were plotting against each other?
 Infighting?
 Feeling that it was ridiculous, Han Jue started to use the derivation function. “Are Immortal Emperor Samsara and Jade Emperor Zhou Yan united?”
 (A billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [Not for the time being.]
 I see.
 Immortal Emperor Samsara was a traitor.
 Han Jue continued to derive. “Does Jade Emperor Zhou Yan have any intention of harming the Heavenly Emperor?”
 (3 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?)
 Continue!
 Han Jue’s heart bled.
 [Not for the time being.)
 Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief.
 Although Jade Emperor Zhou Yan would deduce his whereabouts in the future, it was fine as long as he could protect the Heavenly Emperor.
 This way, Han Jue could enter seclusion without any worries.
 But something was wrong.
 In the previous derivations, the Heavenly Emperor had died a few times, which meant that Jade Emperor Zhou Yan had not helped. Or did Jade Emperor Zhou Yan also die?
 Since Han Jue couldn’t figure it out, he could only put this matter aside for the time being.
 “Continue cultivating. I’ll break through first!”
 Han Jue’s eyes became firm.
 Fifteen years later.
 Han Jue welcomed the opportunity to break through. He began to tackle the Four Mystic Divine Origin.
 Four years later.
 He had successfully broken through!
 Four Mystic Divine Origin!
 Han Jue’s Divine Origin Dharmic powers began to increase as his essence transformed and became even stronger. As he consolidated his cultivation, he opened his attributes panel. [Name: Han Jue]
 (Race: Primordial Fiendcelestial]
 (Cultivation: Four Mystic Divine Origin]
 [Technique: Primordial Chaos Reincarnation Great Dao, Heavenly Cycle Body Tempering]
 (Great Dao: Great Dao of Life and Death, Great Dao of Karma]
 There was hope of reaching the Zenith Heaven Realm before ten thousand years!
 Han Jue thought in satisfaction.
 Of course, this was only his wish. Perhaps the Zenith Heaven Realm required a long period of accumulation.
 Three years later.
 Han Jue’s cultivation had completely stabilized. He wanted to celebrate, but he suddenly discovered that no enemy was worth cursing.
 Li Xuan’ao had been harassed by him, while Li Daokong was very passionate towards him. He was also embarrassed to harm Li Daokong. What if Li Xuan’ao died and Li Daokong died too?
 Hao Tian could be cursed to death, but now that he was sharing his body with Long Hao, it was not good to curse.
 He had also found out that Tai Sutian had no ill intentions towards him for the time being.
 Jade Emperor Zhou Yan was too strong. He couldn’t alert him.
 Immortal Emperor Samsara still had a good impression of him. Han Jue was too embarrassed to kill him.
 The other enemies had low Hatred Points. They were at most unhappy or disgusted with him.
 “Sigh… Why do I suddenly feel a little empty?”
T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by nov(ê(l)biin.co/m Han Jue couldn’t help but miss the Heavenly Dao Buddha, the Demon Emperor, and Zu Tu.
 He might be a masochist.
 But this was good.
 Han Jue shook his head and laughed.
 Forget it, I’ll continue cultivating!
 Han Jue checked the emails while cultivating.
