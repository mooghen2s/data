 He chose option two directly!
 Han Jue couldn’t be bothered to care about what a Heavenly Devil was and directly chose the second option.
 The upgrade of the Dao Field was too important!
 [You chose to cultivate in a low-profile manner and obtained a Great Dao Fragment and a chance to upgrade the Dao Field.)
 [The Dao Field has begun to upgrade.]
 Han Jue immediately felt better.
 No matter how the Heavenly Devils and Sages attack, I’ll stay in the Dao Field and see who can kill me!
 Han Jue recalled his choice.
 Heavenly Dao’s evolution process?
 He recalled carefully. In the legends of the Primordial World, the first Heavenly Dao calamity seemed to be a battle between the Dao and the Devil. Could this be the Heavenly Dao’s fate?
 Regardless of whether it was fate, Han Jue was not interested.
 “If the Dao Field is upgraded this time, won’t it be able to block a Great Dao-level attack?”
 Han Jue looked forward to it silently with bright eyes.
 It always took time to level up the Dao Field.
 At the same time.
 Boundless golden rain poured down, isolated by the Dao Field’s array formation. It formed a spectacular golden barrier high in the sky, like a projection or a miracle descending.
 The disciples of the Hidden Sect sensed that something was wrong. To be able to trigger the array formation meant that this golden rain was extraordinary and might be dangerous.
 “There’s indeed danger!”
 “Who wants to harm us again?”
 “It’s really strange. Our Hidden Sect has always been hiding in the Hundred Peak Immortal River. The Sect Master is also cultivating in seclusion. Why are there always forces looking for trouble with us?”
 “I’m not sure. I think the Hidden Sect might be too strong.”
 “Cultivate well and strive to become a personal disciple as soon as possible. You can serve the Hidden Sect in the future.”
 Discussions ensued in the Hundred Peak Immortal River. Most of the in-name disciples had joined the Hundred Peak Immortal River before they transformed. This was their first home, let alone the living beings born in the Hundred Peak Immortal River. They were even more sincere towards the Hidden Sect.
 Under Li Xuan’ao’s persuasion, other than Han Jue, the personal disciples also began to preach to the in-name disciples and chose the disciples they liked.
 The cohesion of the entire Hidden Sect was already very strong, like an iron plate. At this time, even if the Sages sent disciples to fan the flames, it was useless.
 With the protection of the Dao Field array formation, the Heavenly Devil Golden Rain was completely useless. Half a day later, the golden rain vanished and the Hundred Peak Immortal River welcomed peace again.
 Time passed.
 A hundred years passed.
 [The Dao Field has been upgraded. The array formation has been upgraded to the Freedom Sage level. It has expanded the internal space of the Dao Field.]
 [Dao Field Immortal Qi has increased by ten times. Connate Qi has increased by five times.]
 [The Dao Field can block the prying of Great Dao Divine Spirit existences.]
 Three lines of words appeared in front of Han Jue.
 The Spirit Qi of the entire Hundred Peak Immortal River began to increase, causing all the disciples to be in an uproar.
 Sect Master was using his Mystical Power again!
 Freedom Sage level?
 So the Freedom Sage was stronger than the Heavenly Dao Sage.
 Han Jue couldn’t help but think of Li Zizai. How did this fellow transcend in just tens of thousands of years?
 Could it be that Li Zizai was a Sage himself, but one of his Dharma Idols, the Li family’s ancestor, had an Immortal Emperor cultivation level? After fusing thousands of Dharma Idols, the Li family’s ancestor’s identity became his true body?
 Han Jue felt that this was the only possibility. Otherwise, it didn’t make sense.
 “Can the Heavenly Dao Sages barge in if they attack the Dao Field together?” Han Jue asked in his mind.
 [No]
 This time, the system did not deduct his lifespan. It was probably related to the previous derivation. The system had already remembered the cultivation of the Sages.
 Seeing the word ‘no’, Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief. He felt refreshed.
 Let’s see how you deal with me now!
 Han Jue even wanted to jump out and provoke the Sages.
 But he restrained himself.
Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m He had become arrogant.
 Han Jue cursed himself for having an unstable Dao heart. How could he be arrogant because of the Dao Field?
 No matter how strong the Dao Field was, he was not that strong.
 His cultivation was the most important!
 Han Jue adjusted his state of mind and started cultivating. He also checked the recent emails.
 (Your good friend Jiang Dugu has become a Pseudo-Sage. His cultivation has transformed.)
 (Your good friend Ji Xianshen has stepped into the Zenith Heaven Realm. Because his body contains many powerful wills, his Dao heart is chaotic.]
 (Your good friend Huang Jihao has stepped into the Deity Realm.]
 (Your disciple Su Qi has become a Chaotic Fiendcelestial and is condensing a Great Dao.] [Your good friend Pan Xin was attacked by a Buddhist cultivator] x7392
 (Your good friend Qiu Xilai was cursed by a mysterious curse.]
 (Your good friend Empress Houtu was cursed by a mysterious curse.]
 (Your good friend Huang Zuntian has become the Sect Master of the Jie School. His providence has increased greatly.]
 The Immortal World had risen again!
 Han Jue noticed that Ji Xianshen had stepped into the Zenith Heaven Realm and secretly felt that something was wrong. This kid really wanted to walk the path of a villain. His Dao heart was chaotic and he could go mad at any
 time.
 There was also Huang Jihao. This fellow was a genius Han Jue knew in the mortal world. He had an Innate Sword Heart and later acknowledged Li Xuan’ao as his master. Previously, Han Jue had asked Li Xuan’ao about Huang Jihao and he said that he was most likely dead.
 Han Jue knew that Huang Jihao was still alive. The portrait was still there, but he didn’t know where he was.
 Unexpectedly…
 After Huang Jihao survived the calamity, he had stepped into the Deity Realm alone.
 Indeed, those who could survive the calamity were all destined children.
 Han Jue also noticed that Su Qi had become a Chaotic Fiendcelestial, which meant that he had succeeded.
 He could really use this method to transform his disciples into Chaotic Fiendcelestials!
 That was impressive!
 However, Han Jue did not plan to turn all his disciples into Chaotic Fiendcelestials. He needed too much energy, and there were also unstable elements. Perhaps the disciples would become arrogant and have a rebellious mind.
 Han Jue continued reading. He frowned upon seeing that Qiu Xilai and Empress Houtu were cursed.
 A Sage was pretending to be him!
 This situation had happened in the previous calamity. Han Jue was not surprised, but he was still unhappy.
 Sages also used such methods?
 It was true, Han Jue was two-faced. It was fun if he did it, but he would feel disdain when others did the same.
 As he read, the recent Immortal World began to become exciting.
 The excitement had nothing to do with him or the Hidden Sect.
 Soon, Han Jue entered his cultivation state.
 Outside the 33rd Heaven.
 Great Ultimate Hall.
 Ancestor Xitian stared at the Sages expressionlessly.
 Li Muyi, Sage Jin’an, Sect Master Tian Jue, South Extreme Heavenly Venerate, Qiu Xilai, and Emperor Xiao were all here.
 Sage Jin’an said, “Ancestor, your Dharma eyes can definitely see through variables. Is he a Chaotic Fiendcelestial?”
 The other Sages stared at Ancestor Xitian with anticipation.
 If Han Jue was really a Chaotic Fiendcelestial, the Dark Forbidden Lord might very well be him.
 The reason why they didn’t suspect Han Jue before was that they felt that Han Jue was weak.
 Now that even the Three Pure Sacred Ancestor had lost, the Sages had to reevaluate Han Jue’s cultivation.
 Ancestor Xitian said calmly, “There are no Chaotic Fiendcelestials in this Heavenly Dao. You can rest assured.
 “As for the variable, since it’s a variable, I can’t expose it.”
 The Sages frowned.
 Emperor Xiao couldn’t help but ask, “Ancestor, aren’t you biased towards the variable? Could he be your disciple?”
 Ancestor Xitian glanced at him. “This variable doesn’t harm the Immortal World. There isn’t even much karma at all. In fact, you are the ones plotting against him. If I support you, I will be targeting him instead.”
 These words made the Sages very embarrassed. The sensitive Li Muyi couldn’t help but glare at South Extreme Heavenly Venerate.
 Among the four Sages of the Dao Sect, South Extreme Heavenly Venerate was the one who advocated plotting against Han Jue the most.
