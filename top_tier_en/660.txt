 His eyes reflected a strange light. In his vision, everything that had happened in the palace kept replaying in front of him.
 Soon, he saw Han Jue capture Heavenly Calamity Emperor.
 He frowned. Too fast! The other party’s speed was not inferior to his! He could also directly capture Heavenly Calamity Emperor, but that would require his full strength. Divine Lord Peacock did not stay any longer and vanished.
 Sometime later, the Calamity Race finally discovered that Heavenly Calamity Emperor had disappeared. However, the upper echelons controlled the news. The current Calamity Race could no longer retreat, let alone when they had occupied the netherworld. There was no need to retreat.
 The Calamity Race controlled the news, but they couldn’t hide it from the Sages.
 Outside the 33rd Heaven, Universal Hall. The Sages gathered. Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “The leader of the Calamity Race, Heavenly Calamity Emperor, has disappeared.
 We have to be wary of this.” Fang Liang frowned. “Divine Lord Peacock is still around and the Calamity Race has not descended into chaos. Could it be that Heavenly Calamity Emperor has gone to seek help?” Qiu Xilai shook his head. “Now that the Calamity Race has the upper hand, why would they need helpers??The Calamity Race wants to dominate the Immortal World.”
 The other Sages also discussed. Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du had a headache. The Calamity Race was really too strong. There was even a Freedom Sage guarding outside. They could only worry outside the 33rd Heaven.
 Outside the 33rd Heaven was the top level of the Heavenly Dao. It was a space exclusive to Sages. Here, they could still enjoy the Heavenly Dao’s protection.
 The Sages were afraid of Divine Lord Peacock and could only hide here. They were very aggrieved. “Let’s wait and see. At least the situation is stable,” Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said. Qiu Xilai said, “This battle has stimulated many geniuses. The new generation of cultivators is beginning to gradually ascend the stage.
 The Heavenly Dao in the future will definitely be powerful.” The other Sages nodded. Although the Heavenly Dao had suffered heavy losses, countless experts had also appeared. This was also the reason why they were not in a?hurry.
 Shi Dudao snorted. “I’m just afraid that we won’t be able to survive until then. The Calamity Race can clearly invade the Yang Realm, but they didn’t. It’s obvious that there’s a huge conspiracy, but we don’t even know what they want to do.”
 Universal Hall fell silent again.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du was also thinking, What does the Calamity Race want?
Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com It took an extremely long time to enslave a Freedom Sage. A thousand years passed, but he still did not succeed. During this period of time, Han Jue didn’t dare to cultivate, afraid that the Heavenly Calamity Emperor would find a chance to attack him.
 Although the difference in cultivation between them was great, he had to be cautious. He could reach this point because he was cautious! Han Jue observed the situation in the netherworld and waited patiently. After Heavenly Calamity Emperor disappeared, the Calamity Race was as usual.
 They couldn’t build in the netherworld and kept controlling the cycle of reincarnation. Although there was a continuous stream of Heavenly Dao lifeforms coming to stop them, the overall situation couldn’t stop the Calamity Race. During this period of time, many Zenith Heaven Golden Immortals and even Pseudo-Sages appeared in the Heavenly Dao.
 Dao Sovereign wasn’t the most glorious Pseudo-Sage. There were a few others whose battle achievements were even more ferocious than Dao Sovereign. Among them were the Divine Might Buddha of the Buddhist Sect, the Sect Master of the Jie School, Huang Zuntian, the Divine Palace’s Jing Tiangong, and other familiar faces.
 Divine Lord Peacock did not move. Compared to the beginning of the war, it had been much quieter recently. Han Jue was secretly pleased. I’ll give you a surprise when I enslave the Calamity Race! The Calamity Race was called the strongest race in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End. It would be a pity to destroy them. It was better to accept them and make them the guardians of the Heavenly
 Dao.
 Han Jue had witnessed the battles over the years. The Calamity Race’s combat talent was indeed powerful. Their average level was higher than the Heavenly Dao lifeforms.
 Furthermore, after he captured Heavenly Calamity Emperor, he did not attract any hatred notifications from the mighty figures. This meant that Heavenly Calamity Emperor had no stronger backer. Otherwise, he would directly hate Han Jue like Qiu Xilai.
 Han Jue had already thought of the arrangements for the Calamity Race. He was waiting for the enslavement to succeed!
 Immortal World, a human city.
 Halfway up the mountain, a cloth-robed youth with messy hair faced the sun. His robes fluttered as he absorbed the Eastern Emergence Purple Qi. The cloth-robed youth suddenly opened his eyes. His ordinary facial features suddenly looked sinister as black scales appeared on his face.
 A voice entered his ears.
 “Your Highness, what are you waiting for? Are you going to let His Majesty down?” The cloth-robed youth’s expression returned to normal. “I don’t want to join the Sage Sect. My potential is enough to grow on my own.”
 “No! You have to join. This is His Majesty’s order!”
 “I don’t want to flatter you. Why won’t you give me time? I can rely on myself to reach the peak of cultivation!”
 The mysterious voice was silent.
 The cloth-robed youth closed his eyes and continued cultivating. “Are you really unwilling?”
 “Yes, I want to rely on myself. Don’t worry, I won’t forget my race.”
 “Hehe.”
 Another 400 years passed.
 [Primordial Heavenly Prison has successfully enslaved the target.)
 [Heavenly Calamity Emperor has a favorable impression of you. Current favorability: Max.)
 Han Jue looked at the two lines of words that finally appeared in front of him and heaved a sigh of relief.
 He checked Heavenly Calamity Emperor’s profile picture. (Heavenly Calamity Emperor: Perfected Primordial Chaos Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal, leader of the Calamity Race, Immeasurable Emperor, Connate lifeform. Favorability towards you is maxed.)
 At this realm, if he took another step forward, he would reach the Freedom Realm!
 Han Jue looked at the Heavenly Calamity Emperor and suddenly felt that this woman was not bad-looking Heavenly Calamity Emperor opened her eyes and knelt in front of Han Jue respectfully, calling him Master. Han Jue asked, “Who did you listen to before?” Heavenly Calamity Emperor said, “I didn’t listen to anyone. I just had an agreement with a Great Dao Sage.”
 “Why didn’t you attack the living world?” “I’m afraid there will be an accident. After all, the Flame Race has all perished there. I sent my son to the cycle of reincarnation to be reincarnated as a living being of the Heavenly Dao. In the future, when the Calamity Race dominates the netherworld, we will discuss with the Sages and promote my son to a Sage.
 They will let the Calamity Race completely stabilize ourselves in the Heavenly Dao until we control it alone.” Han Jue was a little surprised that Heavenly Calamity Emperor had such selfish motives. “Don’t you want to destroy the Heavenly Dao?”
 “That’s just what the Great Dao Sage thinks. Destroying the Heavenly Dao is not beneficial to the Calamity Race. I don’t want to be a pawn for the Great Dao Sage for nothing.
 If I can control the Heavenly Dao alone, I will have the right to challenge the Great Dao Sage. The Heavenly Lord of Primordial Beginning said that he would give me a chance to attain the Great Dao, but I don’t believe it. They’re too arrogant. Everything is just empty talk.” Heavenly Calamity Emperor looked disdainful. It had to be said that from Heavenly Calamity Emperor’s point of view, this was a very good plan.
 Unfortunately, she met Han Jue. Han Jue instructed, “You can talk to Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du. The netherworld is divided into half and the Calamity Race will stay there. As for the authority of reincarnation, we’ll talk about it in the future.”
 Heavenly Calamity Emperor immediately agreed. Han Jue waved his hand and sent her out of the Heavenly Dao.
 Heavenly Calamity Emperor sent a voice transmission to Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du. She couldn’t enter the Heavenly Dao and could only send a voice transmission.
 Upon hearing that Heavenly Calamity Emperor wanted to negotiate peace, Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du subconsciously became vigilant. The Calamity Race was in such a good state. Why did they have to negotiate? Heavenly Calamity Emperor returned to her palace and waited for Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du to reply.
 As soon as she entered the hall, a figure appeared in front of her. It was an old Daoist with a dignified expression.
