 He could sense that a powerful force was awakening in the depths of Lu Huaxu’s soul.
 The Four Extreme Emperors of the Heavenly Court were all Zenith Heaven existences.
 Han Jue checked Lu Huaxu’s profile picture again.
 (Lu Huaxu: Early-stage Grand Unity Earth Immortal Realm, Purple Star Emperor, Reincarnation of a Zenith Heaven Emperor. He was once one of the Four Extreme Emperors of the Heavenly Court. He reincarnated with the Supreme Treasure, the Heavenly Dao Purple Emperor Spear. The Purple Emperor Spear is his soul. The two cannot be separated. His talent is powerful. He reached the Grand Unity Earth Immortal Realm in less than 300 years and awakened the Purple Emperor Star Dao Fruit. Current favorability: 5 stars]
 As the latest disciple, he had already reached the early-stage Grand Unity True Immortal Realm. It could be seen how talented the disciples of the Hidden Sect were.
 Han Jue wasn’t worried when he saw that Lu Huaxu’s cultivation level had not changed.
 Even if Lu Huaxu completely awakened and became a Zenith Heaven Emperor, Han Jue was not afraid.
 Not to mention that Han Jue was already an expert in the Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm, the two Dao Field guards were no joke.
 Lü Bu and Ma Chao were two War God Guardians!
 Han Jue paid attention as he absorbed negative karma.
 About half a year later, Lu Huaxu woke up. After waking up, he did not seem to have changed. When everyone asked him, he only smiled and did not say anything. After that, his cultivation speed soared, causing everyone to be speechless.
 After Murong Qi and Chu Shiren, another mighty figure awakened.
 Under Chu Shiren’s introduction, everyone knew that Lu Huaxu was one of the Heavenly Court’s Four Extreme Emperors, the Purple Star Emperor. He was definitely a mighty figure of the myriad worlds. However, with the precedent of the Supreme Buddha, no one would change their attitude towards him.
 They treated him as in the past, especially the Black Hell Chicken. This fellow had taken the lead in bullying Lu Huaxu. It seemed that the stronger Lu Huaxu’s identity was, the more excited it became.
 Lu Huaxu’s rise intensified the internal competition within the Hidden Sect.
 In these boring years, there had to be some competition to be interesting.
 In the dark universe, above the sea of clouds, under the old tree.
 Jade Emperor Zhou Yan was circulating his energy to heal his injuries. His face was extremely pale and he was frowning.
 At this moment, Great Nine Heavens appeared in front of him.
 Jade Emperor Zhou Yan did not open his eyes as he snorted. “Why are you looking for me again?”
 He was filled with hatred towards Great Nine Heavens.
 Great Nine Heavens said calmly, “The Sect Master has ordered you to bow down to the Heavenly Emperor and enter the Divine Investiture Board.”
 Jade Emperor Zhou Yan suddenly opened his eyes. He was furious. “What do you mean? You’re humiliating me?”
 He was once the Heavenly Emperor and had suppressed the Heavenly Court. Telling him to become Heavenly Emperor Fang’s subordinate was definitely an insult to him!
 Great Nine Heavens said, “You have already failed. The Sages have deduced that the protagonists of this Immeasurable Calamity are the humans and the immortals. If you want to fight, you can only enter the Heavenly Court and become an immortal god.”
 Jade Emperor Zhou Yan asked, “Why can’t I join the human race?”
 Great Nine Heavens did not answer.
T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by nov(ê(l)biin.co/m Jade Emperor Zhou Yan was extremely angry. He knew that this was the Sage’s plan.
 He was only a pawn in the hands of a Sage. He had no right to choose.
 Damn it!
 Just a little more!
 If not for the Dark Forbidden Lord, according to his plan, he would have devoured the Heavenly Dao step by step. How would he have ended up like this?
 The more Jade Emperor Zhou Yan thought about it, the more aggrieved he became. He hated the Dark Forbidden Lord.
 Great Nine Heavens vanished, leaving behind a sentence. “This is the only path you can take. If you disobey the Sect Master’s will, you should know the consequences.”
 Jade Emperor Zhou Yan was so angry that his chest heaved.
 He didn’t say anything as he gritted his teeth. “You forced me.”
 A black light flashed in Jade Emperor Zhou Yan’s eyes.
 Twenty years later.
 While cultivating, Han Jue cursed Jade Emperor Zhou Yan and checked his emails.
 (Your good friend Zhou Fan has joined the Heavenly Court and is now an Immortal God. His providence has increased greatly.]
 (Your good friend Mo Fuchou has joined the Heavenly Court and is now an Immortal God. His providence has increased greatly.]
 [Your good friend Huang Jihao has joined the Heavenly Court and is now an Immortal God. His providence has increased greatly.)
 [Your good friend Han Ming has joined the Heavenly Court and is now an Immortal God. His providence has increased greatly.)
 (Your good friend Duan Hongchen has joined the Heavenly Court and is now an Immortal God. His providence has increased greatly.]
 (Your grand-disciple Fang Liang has obtained a Primordial Divine Body. His cultivation has increased greatly.] [Your Dao Companion Xuan Qingjun has joined the Heavenly Court and is now an Immortal God. Her providence has increased greatly.]
 Han Jue’s eyes widened. He was almost shocked.
 What the heck?
 More than half of his friends had joined the Heavenly Court?
 Where did Fang Liang get his appeal from? Han Jue looked carefully and discovered that Xue Minghe had led the Darkness Sect into the Heavenly Court.
 The originally weak Heavenly Court immediately became stronger.
 Was he taking sides?
 Han Jue showed a frown.
 Could Xue Minghe be mistaken?
 Han Jue immediately sent him a dream.
 When they met in the dream, Xue Minghe said excitedly, “Forbidden Lord, you already know?”
 Han Jue said, “Yes.”
 Xue Minghe said, “The protagonists of the calamity are the humans and the Heavenly Court. You’ve always supported the Heavenly Court, so I shouldn’t have done anything wrong by leading the Darkness Sect to join them, right?”
 Han Jue was speechless. He didn’t expect that Heavenly Court’s greatest backing was him.
 At this moment, Han Jue didn’t dare to refute.
 Be it the humans or the Heavenly Court, both sides had people related to him, so he couldn’t help either side.
 Although Han Jue was a human, he didn’t have a sense of belonging to the humans here. After all, he had only stayed in the Jade Pure Sacred Sect his entire life and didn’t know many people.
 “Has anyone contacted you?” Han Jue asked.
 Xue Minghe said, “Yes, the Sage asked me in my dreams to enter the Heavenly Court. It suited me, so I…”
 With that, he suddenly became nervous.
 Wait.
 Would the Forbidden Lord misunderstand him as a traitor?
 He immediately knelt down in fear and said, “I’m loyal to the Forbidden Lord. As for that Sage, I don’t even know who he is.”
 Han Jue asked, “Do you know how many Sages there are?”
 Xue Minghe thought that Han Jue was testing him, so he replied, “There are nine Heavenly Dao Sages for eternity. However, since ancient times, many mighty figures have transcended the Heavenly Dao. I’m not sure how many Sages there are in total. The Sages all live outside the 33rd Heaven or in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End.”
 Han Jue asked, “What about Zenith Heaven?”
 “It’s difficult to guess the number of Zenith Heaven cultivators. After all, there have been more than ten Immeasurable Calamities…” “Then, do you know about the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End?”
 “I know. It’s the Heavenly Dao’s first world in the Primordial Era. Because of a calamity, a Sage took action and shattered the world. The Dao Ancestor isolated the Primordial Heaven and Earth and left the various races in the current Immortal World. Only mighty figures can go to the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End and stay away from the Heavenly Dao’s calamity.”
 “How much stronger is the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End than the Immortal World?”
 “It’s hard to say, but they’re all controlled by Sages.”
 Han Jue stopped asking.
 Xue Minghe became nervous and couldn’t help but ponder over Han Jue’s words.
 Could it be that the Forbidden Lord was warning him that there was always someone stronger?
 It was very likely!
 He couldn’t make decisions without permission in the future. He had to wait for the Forbidden Lord’s arrangements.
 “Yes, that’s all. From now on, you will listen to Heavenly Emperor Fang until I give you a new order.”
 Han Jue canceled the dream.
 After returning to reality, Han Jue no longer cared about the Heavenly Court.
 However, eighteen years later.
 Han Jue learned from the emails that Long Hao and Di Lantian had joined the Heavenly Court…
 The humans were in danger!
