 At this moment.
 The clouds were pierced by golden light. After the clouds dispersed, figures emitting dazzling light appeared above the clouds. They were the Heavenly Race’s immortals.
 The leader was Fang Liang. Beside him were the Heavenly God General and the Divine General.
 Fang Liang looked down and asked, “Do you see anything?”
 The Divine General frowned. “They look like devils but not devils. They look more like the Asura Race that was wiped out in the previous calamity.”
 The Heavenly God General nodded. “That’s right. It should be the Asura Race. It’s said that when Xue Minghe died, he used a mysterious Mystical Power to make a comeback in the future.”
 Fang Liang fell into deep thought. The glaciers in a radius of tens of millions of kilometers suddenly collapsed. The rising ice mist pushed into the sky. It was extremely spectacular and shocking.
 In the boundless fog, he could vaguely see a terrifying figure. It was difficult to tell its true body.
 Fang Liang waved his hand and said, “Capture this evil thing!”
 The Divine General and the Heavenly God General immediately rushed down. The other immortals followed closely behind.
 In the Hundred Peak Immortal River, Han Jue had just started preaching for less than a year.
 He suddenly felt a vast aura coming from the extreme north. It was at least a Pseudo-Sage and was no inferior to Shi Dudao.
 Han Jue didn’t stop preaching. As he spoke, he looked into the distance.
 Fang Liang led the team and was forcefully suppressed by the mysterious existence. The situation was critical.
 Han Jue had no intention of helping. Fang Liang was not his son. Since he was wandering outside, he should pay the price.
 Han Jue couldn’t protect every disciple of the Hidden Sect. Furthermore, Fang Liang had never returned. If not for his favorability not decreasing, he would have suspected that Fang Liang had already betrayed the sect.
 Before long, Li Daokong rushed to the 13th Heaven to provide assistance. A world-shattering battle was about to take place.
 After thousands of years, Li Daokong had become much stronger. His comprehension of the Ten Thousand Life Sword had deepened and was on par with the mysterious existence.
 Since it was a draw, Li Daokong would not lose.
 Han Jue began to focus on the lecture.
 A hundred years passed. Most of the disciples had improved after a hundred years of preaching, but the personal disciples’ cultivation levels had not increased noticeably.
 Han Jue had already taught them the Great Dao of Extreme Origin more than ten times. They had already comprehended what they needed to. It was very difficult to forcefully comprehend anything else.
 Unconsciously, potential and comprehension were like the shackles of the Heavenly Dao suppressing the Hidden Sect disciples. There was no Deity Realm among the in-name disciples yet. The strongest was only a Rank Seven Immortal Emperor.
 At this rate, only one Pseudo-Sage would appear among a million in-name disciples. Han Jue thought as he returned to the Daoist temple. He sat on the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus and began to check his emails.
 At this moment, he suddenly felt something and closed his eyes.
 In the Primordial World, Su Qi was calling him.
 Han Jue’s voice sounded, “What is it?”
 It had been some time since he had become a Chaotic Fiendcelestial. Su Qi’s body had already condensed and was no different from a living being.
 “Master, when can I go out? The Chaotic Qi here can no longer help me grow.” Su Qi hurriedly replied with a nervous tone.
 After all, he had died before. He was worried that Han Jue would not let him out again.
 Han Jue indeed thought so.
 “Can you control bad luck now?”
 “Yes!”
 Han Jue sensed carefully. Su Qi did restrain himself very well and didn’t leak it.
 He began to consider.
 Su Qi was nervous, afraid that Han Jue would not agree.
 He recalled the mistakes he had made and felt even less confident.
 If he was Han Jue, he wouldn’t let him out either.
 Reincarnation couldn’t wash away sins!
 Suddenly!
 Su Qi felt his vision blur. His feet suddenly landed on the ground, and the surrounding scene turned into a Daoist temple. The divine light of the Sun and Moon Yin-Yang Protection caused him to squint his eyes.
 “Master!”
 Su Qi knelt down excitedly, his voice trembling.
 How many years had it been? He finally saw Han Jue with his own eyes.
 Such a long separation was not a lifetime in the mortal world, but a Heavenly Dao Era.
 Han Jue said, “From now on, you are to stay in the Hundred Peak Immortal River and not leave. Go out and find a place to stay.”
 Su Qi nodded, too excited to say anything.
 It was already good enough to see the light of day again. He naturally did not dare to think of complete freedom.
 After walking out of the Daoist temple, Su Qi looked at the blinding sunlight and cried.
 “I’m alive again... This time, I won’t be a pawn anymore!”
 Su Qi clenched his fists, his shoulders trembling from excitement.
 Zhang Jue, Cao Cao, and the crimson fox looked at him with strange expressions.
 Su Qi sensed their existence and smiled at them before walking up to communicate.
 Zhang Jue and Cao Cao ignored him, but the crimson fox was very passionate.
 The crimson fox was a little demon beast that Han Jue had taken in when he was training in the mortal world. It had come to the Hundred Peak Immortal River and had been cultivating obediently. It had just broken through to the Grand Unity True Immortal Realm not long ago.
 After chatting for a while, Su Qi left to visit the other disciples. Soon, the personal disciples learned that Su Qi had revived. All the personal disciples were shocked.
 Impossible!
 Wasn’t Su Qi dead?
 They knew that Su Qi had ended the previous Immeasurable Calamity.
 Even Li Xuan’ao came to see him.
 All the personal disciples gathered under the Fusang Tree. They surrounded Su Qi and asked him questions.
 “Master revived you?”
 “Do you remember what you did?”
 “How did you destroy all living beings? You’re too strong!”
 “After using the Dao Destruction Mystical Power, how did you escape the destruction of the Heavenly Dao?”
 “It doesn’t make sense...”
 The disciples were all surprised. The Black Hell Chicken even thought that he only had Su Qi’s appearance.
 Su Qi sighed. “I don’t know why. After I died, I was in a deep sleep until I woke up. When I heard Master’s voice, I thought he must have saved me.”
 Li Xuan’ao clicked his tongue in wonder. “Even the Heavenly Dao Calamity can be reversed. Could Sect Master really be the manifestation of the Dao Ancestor?”
 He had always heard the Black Hell Chicken say that Han Jue was the reincarnation of the Dao Ancestor. He didn’t believe it, but on careful thought, it really made sense.
 After the Dao Ancestor disappeared, the timing of Han Jue’s rise was too coincidental. Su Qi said, “From now on, I’ll stay here and cultivate. I won’t go out again. As for everything in the past, I hope that you won’t tease me anymore. I don’t feel any honor in doing that.”
 He sighed.
 If not for him being forced to the end and being bewitched by a Sage, why would he do that?
 Thinking about it now, he was filled with guilt.
 Dao Sovereign snorted. “I hope you really feel guilty.”
 Zhao Xuanyuan and Long Hao’s expressions were also very ugly. They did not speak.
 In the previous calamity, many of their friends and relatives had died. Su Qi was the culprit. Even if he was bewitched by the Sages, the three of them could not completely forget it.
 The Black Hell Chicken shouted, “Su Qi, let us torture you a hundred times in the simulation trial. You can’t fight back. Just treat it as us venting our anger for the previous calamity!”
 Su Qi asked curiously, “What is the simulation trial?”
