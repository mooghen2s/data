 Why would a Sage teach him such a powerful Mystical Power?
 He must be using him!
 It was impossible for him to teach it and not let him use it!
 Han Jue asked, “Do you want to come back now?”
 If Su Qi was willing to return, Han Jue would directly go and take him in. If he offended a Sage, so be it. In any case, the other party wouldn’t be able to find the Dao Field.
 Su Qi was silent.
 Han Jue wanted to curse when he saw that.
 What was wrong with these people? All of them knew that their bodies might be crushed in front of them, but they still wanted to fight to the death!
 Han Jue even suspected that their will had been changed by the calamity.
 Su Qi sighed. “Master, I have my own goals. I’m not being led around. This time, when I return to the Immortal World, I want to use the Heavenly Dao merit to wash away my fate. I don’t want to be the God of Misfortune. If I go back with you and don’t want to affect my fellow disciples, I’ll be suppressed by the array formation. I don’t want to live like that.”
 Han Jue also fell silent.
 That was the truth.
 If he was Su Qi, he wouldn’t want to do that.
 Han Jue had also rerolled the corresponding Connate providence when he was young, but he had immediately skipped it.
 “In that case, it’s up to you.
 “But if you die, do you have any last wishes?”
 Han Jue smiled and asked casually.
 Su Qi also smiled. He no longer felt the pressure from before and was relieved.
 He smiled and said, “I definitely have regrets, but I don’t need to trouble you, Master. I’m already prepared for anything. I won’t regret it even if I die. It’s just that I won’t have a chance to repay you in this life.”
 Thinking back, Su Qi felt mixed emotions.
 If he didn’t meet Han Jue, he would probably still be floating in the cycle of reincarnation.
 He might even die several times in the Immeasurable Calamity.
 The master and disciple chatted for a while more before the dream ended.
 Su Qi smiled and watched Han Jue leave as the dream chattered.
 Back in the cave abode.
 Han Jue opened his eyes, and they flashed coldly.
 The more open-minded Su Qi was, the more uncomfortable he felt.
 Although this uncomfortable feeling was not enough to make him lose his mind, he was still a little angry.
 Su Qi was really the most tragic person.
 Because of misfortune, everyone he encountered was bound to suffer misfortune, and he would forever shoulder guilt and sins. In the long run, he would be annihilated by the Heavenly Dao.
 Ever since he was born, he was destined to be destroyed.
 It was futile no matter how he struggled.
 Su Qi thought that Han Jue was someone who treated him well.
 However, Han Jue knew that the reason why he treated him well was actually a lie. He hated Su Qi at first and even used him.
 It had been more than seven thousand years. How many enemies had Su Qi dealt with for him?
 The Heavenly Emperor had done nothing to him, but so had Su Qi.
 In the entire Hidden Sect, other than Xing Hongxuan, Su Qi had done the most for Han Jue.
 “Forget it. I’ll save you if I can. If not, I can only leave you in my memories.”
 Han Jue thought firmly, and his emotions disappeared quickly.
 He asked in his mind, “I want to know Su Qi’s outcome in this Immeasurable Calamity.”
 (A billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue! Han Jue entered the illusion.
 When he opened his eyes again, Han Jue came to a desert. Sand filled the air and a blood aura covered the sky.
 At a glance, it could be seen that the land was barren and desolate.
T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by nov(ê(l)biin.co/m Han Jue’s gaze quickly locked onto a figure.
 Su Qi.
 He was kneeling on the top of a slope. His left shoulder and left arm were no longer there. The wound was surrounded by strange black Qi.
 His hair was disheveled, his face was covered in blood, and his eyes were empty.
 Han Jue noticed that his body was petrified and his life force was dissipating quickly.
 Han Jue frowned.
 Su Qi was going to die?
 At this moment, a black and white aura appeared above Su Qi’s head. It spun into a vortex and a figure appeared. It was Sage Fated Secrets.
 Sage Fated Secrets looked down at Su Qi from above.
 “Su Qi, you used the Dao Destruction Mystical Power to slaughter all living beings. The Heavenly Dao does not tolerate it. Since you are my successor, what dying wish do you have?”.
 Hearing this, Su Qi raised his head with difficulty. He looked numbly at Sage Fated Secrets and asked in a hoarse voice, “Why is this Mystical Power…”
 Sage Fated Secrets said expressionlessly, “Sages will only lose a major realm. However, to those below the level of a Sage, you have to sacrifice everything, let alone you who is burdened with overwhelming negative karma.”
 Han Jue was shocked. There was such a price?
 He would ask when he returned!
 Su Qi smiled bitterly. Soon, his body was completely petrified. Sage Fated Secrets waved his hand, and Su Qi turned into dust that scattered with the wind.
 “The calamity has ended and the Heavenly Dao has restarted. Everything is like an illusion…”
 With that, Sage Fated Secrets vanished.
 The illusion shattered.
 When Han Jue returned to reality, he first asked if he would die directly if he used the Dao Destruction Mystical Power.
 [No]
 Han Jue was relieved. The system’s products were indeed different.
 He guessed that the Dao Destruction Mystical Power Su Qi had learned was an altered one, or that the Sage Fated Secrets had used a technique on it.
 “This fellow is indeed scamming my disciple.”
 Han Jue cursed silently. His hatred towards Sage Fated Secrets increased.
 No, he had to curse him. Otherwise, his anger wouldn’t be appeased.
 Han Jue took out the Book of Misfortune and started cursing.
 He would curse for a trillion years first!
 Anyway, Han Jue was about to break through. At that time, his lifespan would be refreshed.
 Five days later, Han Jue’s lifespan began to be reduced.
 Outside the 33rd level of heaven, in the Great Ultimate Hall.
 Sage Fated Secrets was visiting Ancestor Xitian and listening to him preach. He suddenly frowned.
 The mysterious curse power increased.
 Who was so blind?
 They actually found trouble with him when he was visiting the Transcendent Dao Expert. Didn’t the other Sages know about this?
 “Who’s cursing you?” Ancestor Xitian asked calmly.
 Sage Fated Secrets said, “I’m not sure, either. I can’t deduce it. Senior, can you help me?”
 Ancestor Xitian shook his head.
 Sage Fated Secrets sensed that something was wrong, so he changed the topic and asked, “Have the traces of the Dao Ancestor appeared?”
 “He has always been here and has never been anywhere.” Hearing this, Sage Fated Secrets fell into deep thought. After a while.
 He suddenly felt the curse’s power increase again. “With such a curse, if it was a Pseudo-Sage, he would probably be completely unconscious. Could it be that the Dark Forbidden Lord really exists and that it is a Sage’s scheme?”
 Sage Fated Secrets frowned.
 Ancestor Xitian said, “It’s time for you to return. I’ll only give you a piece of advice. There’s always a chance of survival in the Three Thousand Great Dao. You Sages have to hold back and leave some room for survival.”
 Sage Fated Secrets nodded and stood up to bow.
 Inside the Connate Cave Abode.
 Han Jue had already 900 billion years of his lifespan deducted and was a little dizzy.
 Forget it. Han Jue put down the Book of Misfortune and stopped cursing.
 The Sage gave him the feeling of a bottomless pit. No matter how he cursed the other party, there was no outcome.
 (Ancestor Xitian’s favorability towards you has increased. Current favorability: 3 stars]
 Han Jue was surprised to see a line of words.
 Ancestor Xitian?
 What happened?
 Han Jue immediately checked Ancestor Xitian’s information.
 [Ancestor Xitian: Cultivation unknown. Transcendent Dao Expert. Lives in the 33rd Layered Heaven. Unrestrained by fate and the Heavenly Dao, he has experienced nine Immeasurable Calamities. Because you have changed the Heavenly Dao’s calamity several times, he has a favorable impression of you. Current favorability: 3 stars]
