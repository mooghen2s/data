 A line of words appeared in front of him.
 (Dark Falling Prison: A prison located in the Dark Forbidden Zone. It was created by the Dark Sage King. It is said that even Sages will not be able to escape death if they enter this prison.]
 How pretentious!
 Han Jue secretly felt disdain.
 At this moment, a majestic voice sounded outside the prison.
 “Prepare yourselves. The Sage King is about to preach the Dao. All of you vile beasts must not be negligent!”
 Black tentacles suddenly emerged from the ground of the prison and wrapped around all the living beings inside. Han Tuo’s back was pierced by the black tentacles. He looked pained. Yi Tian cursed. “What nonsense are you spouting! Aren’t you just trying to enslave us? Kill me if you have the guts! Don’t give me a chance. If I escape in the future, your bodies and souls will be destroyed!”
 Boom
 A black lightning bolt struck down, shattering Yi Tian into pieces. Blood splattered all over the ground.
 Immediately after, another light descended and recovered his body.
 The other living beings were not shocked. They were numb to this already.
 They had all experienced this pain. They died and revived endlessly.
 The illusion shattered.
 Han Jue continued to ask, “If I attack with my fastest speed, can I insta-kill the Dark Sage King?”
 (Ten billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 (There’s hope]
 The system did not say yes, but it at least meant that Han Jue could insta-kill the Dark Sage King in a normal situation.
 “Is there anyone stronger than me behind the Dark Sage King?” [Ten billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [Yes]
 Han Jue remained silent. He wasn’t surprised. One had to know that the Heavenly Dao Sages all had powerful backgrounds. Under such circumstances, for the Dark Sage King to dare to bite the Heavenly Dao, he was definitely fearless.
 When the Sages fought, there were even more extraordinary existences behind them.
 Han Jue thought for a moment and asked again, “Why did the Dark Sage King capture these Heavenly Dao lifeforms?”
 (Ten billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 Han Jue entered another illusion.
 He opened his eyes and came to a mysterious hall.
 The Dark Sage King stood in front of three majestic stone statues. He did not bend down. His back was straight.
 “The Deity Realm of the Ruins of End has already begun to descend into chaos. What are you going to do next?”
 A mysterious voice sounded with an indifferent tone.
 The Dark Sage King replied, “Capture the person with the greatest providence in the Heavenly Dao and turn him into my servant. When we attack the Heavenly Dao in the future, let these servants be the vanguard and tear apart the Heavenly Dao rules.”
 “How confident are you?”
 “Absolute!”
 “Alright, the chaos in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End this time has used the great Dharmic powers of an ancient existence. Don’t mess it up.” “Understood.”
 The illusion ended. It was very short, but the information revealed was tremendous The existence behind the Dark Sage King was actually still plotting against the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End.
 “I want to know what force is behind the Dark Sage King. Who led it?” Han Jue thought silently.
 (This karma involves an existence that surpasses the system’s limits. It cannot be deduced.]
 So powerful?
 Han Jue began to think about how to save Han Tuo.
 If it was in the Immortal World, he could let him go. Now that Han Tuo had been captured by the Dark Sage King, if he did not attack, his son would most likely be gone.
 He could only teach Han Tuo the Invocation Technique. Han Jue used the Invocation Dao to summon Han Tuo.
 Although his identity would be exposed, Han Jue couldn’t care less.
 After thinking, he immediately sent a dream to Han Tuo.
 Then, he frowned.
 Eh?
 He couldn’t send a dream!
 Han Jue used the Dark Nightmare, but there was no reaction.
 It seemed that the Dark Falling Prison was not simple.
 Wait.
 Han Jue suddenly thought of the Reincarnation Mystic Realm.
 The Dark Sage King captured him through the Reincarnation Mystic Realm.
 Han Jue could send someone to infiltrate the Reincarnation Mystic Realm and be caught like Han Tuo.
 After thinking for a moment, he sent Liu Bei over.
 Liu Bei was his Reincarnation Avatar and later possessed the body of the Buddhist Sect’s Victorious Fighting Buddha. After so many years, his cultivation level had already increased to the Five Mystic Divine Origin.
 His potential was still a little lacking. When Han Jue created the Reincarnation Avatar, his potential was also not good, so Liu Bei’s improvement was very slow.
 However, as a pawn, it was definitely enough.
 Liu Bei entered the Daoist temple and knelt down.
 “I’m sending you to the Reincarnation Mystic Realm…”
 Han Jue told him what had happened. Although Liu Bei was nervous, he still braced himself and agreed.
 “You have grasped the Invocation Technique. If you encounter danger, you can summon me. Since you already understand the mission, I will seal this memory before you leave. You only need to remember that once you are in the Reincarnation Mystic Realm, if you encounter the Dark Sage King, you must summon me.”
 “I understand.”
 “Go.”
 Han Jue waved his sleeve and sent him out.
 Although Liu Bei was timid, he was very capable. Back in the netherworld, he had found Hidden Sect Island.
 Still worried, Han Jue then sent a dream to Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du.
T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by nov(ê(l)biin.co/m The dream was a sea of clouds, the sky was vast and beautiful.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du opened his eyes and saw that it was Han Jue. His eyes lit up. Han Jue didn’t speak immediately.
 He was gambling that the one who had attacked the Sages was the Dark Sage King. Now, the Sages should be looking forward to him dealing with him.
 The Dark Sage King’s appearance made the Heavenly Dao Sages stand on the same side.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du asked, “You sent me a dream probably because of your son.”
 The Sages actually knew Han Tuo’s identity, but they had not pointed it out in the past.
 They were not stupid. It was impossible for them to think of capturing Han Tuo to threaten Han Jue. It was not realistic, and they would fall out with each other.
 It was very normal for him to sever the emotions and karma after becoming a Sage.
 Han Jue asked, “Do you want to deal with the Dark Sage King?”
 “Yes!”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du replied bluntly, “Let’s join forces. The Dark Sage King’s goal is the Heavenly Dao. He can’t kill his way in for the time being, but he has been devouring the Little Heavenly Dao in the chaos. When he truly has the strength to kill his way into the Heavenly Dao, we Sages will not be his match.”
 “If we join forces to deal with the Dark Sage King, will we be plotted against by the existence behind him?”
 “He has a backing, so do we!”
 Han Jue remained silent.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du thought for a moment and continued, “We Sages will contact the masters in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End and let them restrain the existence behind the Dark Sage King. In the past, they might have been worried, but recently, the existence behind the Dark Sage King has gone overboard and has already infuriated the mighty figures in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End. This matter should be settled.”
 He stared at Han Jue and asked, “If no other mighty figures interfere, can we join forces to kill the Dark Sage King?”
 He was very aggrieved. He was originally a Freedom Sage, and dealing with the Dark Sage King was nothing difficult. However, now that he was restricted to the Heavenly Dao Sage position, he wasn’t the Dark Sage King’s match.
 Now, he could only place his hopes on Han Jue.
 This fellow was very strong and had even used his strength to attain the Dao. The Heavenly Dao Sages were not his match. In addition, if they joined forces, they might be able to kill the Dark Sage King.
 Han Jue stared at him and asked, “Can I believe you?”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said calmly, “If you don’t believe it now, you will sooner or later. Your foundation should be the reincarnation of a Chaotic Fiendcelestial, but it’s the same for the Dark Sage King. He’s still constantly absorbing the Little Heavenly Dao. You’re becoming stronger, and so is he.”
