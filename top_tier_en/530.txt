 Han Jue was stunned. What a coincidence!
 South Extreme Heavenly Venerate had just announced that he would choose the next batch of Sages when Nüwa sent him a dream.
T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by nov(ê(l)biin.co/m Could it be that Nüwa had been staring at the Heavenly Dao?
 Han Jue was secretly vigilant. Would she use him as a tool?
 “If I accept Nüwa’s dream, will I face danger?”
 (50 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Tsk tsk, the value was even higher than the Heavenly Dao.
 Continue!
 [Yes]
 Han Jue frowned. He couldn’t agree.
 He could deduce it himself. There was no need to take the risk personally.
 “I want to know why Nüwa is looking for
 me.”
 (100 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Why did it double?
 Han Jue frowned and chose to continue.
 Immediately after, he entered the illusion.
 This was a vast sea of stars. The stars were bright and the Heavenly River hung upside down. The scene was beautiful and mysterious.
 Nüwa stood in the rainbow light. Above her head was a pair of eyes. They were extremely huge, as if one eye could take in the entire universe. “The Heavenly Dao has developed intelligence. It is truly caused by the greed of the Sages. The calamity of all living beings is perhaps here.”
 A cold voice resounded through the universe.
 Nüwa frowned. “I’ve already transcended the Heavenly Dao. I don’t want to care about it anymore.”
 The other party added, “But your roots are in the Heavenly Dao. Even if you are on par with the Great Dao, if the Heavenly Dao is gone and you encounter danger in the future, it’s only wishful thinking for you to want to be reborn.”
 Nüwa frowned even more.
 Han Jue was curious about who was talking to her. It sounded very impressive.
 Nüwa sighed. “What should I do?”
 “You have to think about it. You don’t have to do it personally. Didn’t you Sages do this in the past?”
 “Alright!”
 Han Jue was surprised. The other party was clearly mocking her. Nüwa was actually not angry. This meant that the other party was far stronger than the current her. Who was it?
 At this moment, the illusion shattered.
 Han Jue asked, “I want to know who spoke to Nüwa in the derivation.”
 (Unable to deduce its true form, the system needs to be upgraded again.)
 Han Jue frowned. So impressive?
 Could it really be the Dao Ancestor!
 All along, Han Jue couldn’t deduce the Dao Ancestor’s avatars and Dharma Idols.
 One thing was certain. The Dao Ancestor was definitely not dead!
 “It just so happens that Nüwa wants to use me to fight against a Sage. It doesn’t matter if I accept this dream or not. In any case, she can see it.”
 Han Jue thought silently and started cultivating
 A hundred years passed quickly.
 On this day, Han Jue looked up and saw many figures pouring into a Dao Field palace in the 33rd Heaven.
 South Extreme Heavenly Venerate was about to preach.
 Han Jue struggled for a moment but still decided to deal with him.
 At the very least, he couldn’t let South Extreme Heavenly Venerate lie so smoothly.
 He didn’t curse immediately.
 Fifty years later.
 Han Jue took out the Book of Misfortune and started cursing South Extreme Heavenly Venerate.
 Five days later.
 He began to curse South Extreme Heavenly Venerate with all his might!
 At the same time.
 Outside the 33rd Heaven, Heavenly Venerate Hall.
 The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate sat on the lotus throne and suddenly opened his eyes with a frown.
 There were thousands of listeners in the hall. The lowest was an Immortal Emperor. They were all in a state of Dao comprehension.
 “Damn it, the Dark Forbidden Lord is cursing me at this time!”
 South Extreme Heavenly Venerate cursed in his heart. He couldn’t help but think about the Dark Forbidden Lord’s true identity.
 Now, the Sages were all saying that Han Jue was the Dark Forbidden Lord, but he didn’t think so.
 After all, on the surface, Han Jue didn’t conflict with them. The Hidden Sect had also been hiding in one place. He still suspected that the Dark Forbidden Lord was another Sage.
 Because Han Jue was not in the 33rd Heaven, the true Dark Forbidden Lord could easily defame him.
 Although South Extreme Heavenly Venerate didn’t like Han Jue, he hated Qiu Xilai even more.
 South Extreme Heavenly Venerate had no choice but to circulate his Dharmic powers to resist the curse.
 After a while.
 South Extreme Heavenly Venerate gritted his teeth and sent a voice transmission to Li Muyi and Sect Master Tian Jue.
 Soon, the two Sages appeared behind him.
 Li Muyi waved his sleeve and set up a barrier. The listeners wouldn’t be able to see them.
 The two Sages raised their hands and used their Dharmic powers to help South Extreme Heavenly Venerate.
 Sect Master Tian Jue frowned and sent a voice transmission, “We have to eliminate the Dark Forbidden Lord. When will we attack the Hidden Sect?”
 Li Muyi did not answer. He was also hesitating
 South Extreme Heavenly Venerate said, “If the Dark Forbidden Lord isn’t from the Hidden Sect, wouldn’t we be pushing Han Jue towards him?”
 Sect Master Tian Jue narrowed his eyes. “Speaking of which, before the calamity ended, Qiu Xilai had been trying to rope Han Jue in and protect everyone who has karma with him. Could it be…”
 Li Muyi’s eyes flickered.
 He actually suspected the same, but he was afraid that it was true.
 It would be too terrifying if Qiu Xilai was the Dark Forbidden Lord.
 Sage Fated Secrets had already gone mad. Qiu Xilai was the only Sage who had grasped the Dao Destruction Mystical Power!
 The Dark Forbidden Lord first got rid of Sage Fated Secrets. The one who benefited was Qiu Xilai!
 “Let’s survive this calamity first,” Li Muyi said with a low voice.
 They could all sense that the curse power had strengthened again. This power was similar to when it had cursed Sage Jin’an.
 Han Jue stopped cursing after a trillion years of his lifespan was deducted.
 He looked at the 33rd Heaven. The listeners had yet to leave the Dao Field. It seemed that the lecture was still ongoing.
 He would curse after a while.
 Han Jue thought of South Extreme Heavenly Venerate’s pain and he couldn’t help but be happy.
 Several months later.
 Han Jue was about to curse South Extreme Heavenly Venerate when a domineering shout sounded.
 “I’m Shi Dudao. Today, I came to challenge the master of the Hidden Sect. We will only talk about victory and defeat. There is no grudge!”
 This voice disturbed all the Hidden Sect disciples.
 Han Jue had a strange expression.
 Because he had copied Shi Dudao, he had personally come. He actually felt as if the dimensional barrier had been broken.
 Han Jue thought for a moment and sent a voice transmission to Li Daokong, “This person is the strongest below the Sages. Do you want to fight him?”
 “Of course!” Li Daokong immediately replied.
 Then, Han Jue moved him out.
 Above the mountain range, Shi Dudao’s robes fluttered in the wind. His aura was like a rainbow. When he saw Li Daokong appear, he couldn’t help but frown.
 “Why is it you?” Shi Dudao asked unhappily.
 Li Daokong said calmly, “Senior, I’m already a guardian of the Hidden Sect. If you want to challenge our Sect Master, you have to defeat me first!”
 Clang
 He drew his sword from his waist. His sword was not an ordinary sword. It was a Heavenly Dao Numinous Treasure and was once the beloved sword of a Sage of the Human School.
 Shi Dudao shook his head. “You are not my match.”
 Li Daokong suddenly attacked. His speed was extremely fast. He teleported in front of Shi Dudao and slashed down.
 Boom
 A terrifying aura shook the world, forming visible dragons that twisted wantonly.
 Shi Dudao easily blocked Li Daokong’s sword with his index finger.
 His expression was cold as he said disdainfully, “Since you want to fight, then fight!”
 “A Pseudo-Sage dares to challenge me? When I stepped into the Pseudo-Sage Realm, you, Li Daokong, had yet to be born!”
 With that said, Shi Dudao’s eyes emitted a black light, startling Li Daokong so much that he immediately jumped away
 Black light flashed and the sky was pierced through. Space-time lightning interwove in the black hole.
