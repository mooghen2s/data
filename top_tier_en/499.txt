 (South Extreme Heavenly Venerate]
 Han Jue wasn’t surprised. He wouldn’t have become no matter who it was.
 The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate was the Chan School’s sect master. Han Jue could take revenge on him and target the Chan School. This way, his identity would not be easily exposed.
 It was related to the Primordial Purple Qi. It was impossible for the entire Chan School to meddle with it. It had to be personally arranged by a Sage.
 Han Jue put this matter aside. He would target him in the future.
 Even if all the living beings in the Immortal World came to attack the Hundred Peak Immortal River, it was impossible to break through the array formation.
 Everyone below the Sages was an ant!
 Moreover, the true body of a Sage could not enter!
 Han Jue began to cultivate the Grand Unity Aspect and broke through again. He didn’t know how many Fiendcelestial Aspects he could cultivate this time.
 Thirty years later.
 Han Jue cultivated the Lawless Fiendcelestial, Rainbow Light Fiendcelestial, Void Fiendcelestial, Cursing Light Fiendcelestial, Stone Fiendcelestial, Space-splitting Fiendcelestial, Time Fiendcelestial, Traversal Fiendcelestial, Mystic Desires Fiendcelestial, Fear Fiendcelestial, Chaotic Wave Fiendcelestial, Saber Fiendcelestial, Hidden Fiendcelestial, Qi Fiendcelestial, and Heart Fiendcelestial.
 A total of 15 Fiendcelestials!
 He had accumulated 49 Fiendcelestials!
 Han Jue’s strength increased greatly, and he started the simulation trial.
 Just like before, he insta-killed all existences below the Sages!
F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com The only change was that he could resist Sages now!
 He challenged Fuxitian. The 49 Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols attacked together and fought Fuxitian to a draw.
 The 49 Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols each represented a rule. To be precise, they were all Lesser Great Dao. When they attacked together, they could destroy the world.
 It was only a draw!
 Han Jue was very angry.
 Even this could not kill a Heavenly Dao Sage?
 Then, how could he cross realms to kill enemies in the future?
 Han Jue was very dissatisfied with his combat strength.
 He began to target Fuxitian crazily and fought continuously.
 After ten years, Han Jue still didn’t succeed in killing him. It had to be said that the Heavenly Dao Sage was indeed impressive.
 “If you want to kill a Sage, you might have to sever the Heavenly Dao’s providence,” Han Jue muttered to himself as his eyes flickered.
 In the battle, he had killed Fuxitian many times, but this fellow quickly revived as if he couldn’t be killed.
 Facing an existence that couldn’t be killed at all, even Han Jue almost collapsed.
 “If I really face a Sage in the future, he might explode and trick me again.”
 Han Jue thought of a scene and felt his blood run cold.
 Fortunately, there was the simulation trial. Otherwise, he would have definitely failed.
 After Han Jue decided to attain the Dao, he wanted to fight with every Sage for a hundred years. He wanted to find the easiest way to kill the enemy and kill them with one strike!
 Han Jue stood up and stretched as he walked out of the Daoist temple.
 “Everyone, prepare to listen to the lecture!”
 Han Jue’s voice resounded throughout the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 All the disciples became excited and flocked to the land of listeners.
 Even Li Daokong and Li Xuan’ao rushed over immediately. Clearly, they had been looking forward to it for a long time.
 Outside the Hundred Peak Immortal River, countless living beings were gathered.
 A huge bird circled high in the sky. The black feathers on its body were shiny as if they were watered by iron. It had a wingspan of a thousand feet, and it looked like a hawk. It had three cat-like tails.
 “There are so many immortals inside!” the Three-Tailed Giant Eagle shouted excitedly.
 With so many Immortal Gods in the Hundred Peak Immortal River, the legend about the Primordial Purple Qi was very likely true.
 “Immortal Gods?”
 Gasp
 Why were there so many?
 “Taking human form is indeed considered an Immortal God.”
 “The Hidden Sect really exists!” “What are they doing?”
 “I can’t sense their aura. It seems that there’s a powerful array formation isolating them.”
 The living beings discussed animatedly. There was no lack of Daoists who had transformed, and they came in all forms.
 There were so many immortals in the Hidden Sect. How could they break in?
 At this moment.
 The ground shook as a terrifying giant ten thousand feet tall rushed over from the end of the horizon. It was unstoppable.
 The giant was bare-chested, and its muscles looked like they were formed from huge and hard rocks. It was a visual impact.
 His hair was disheveled as he crashed into the formation of the Hundred Peak Immortal River with unstoppable force. The terrifying waves that stirred up sent thousands of living beings flying as screams of agony filled the air.
 “It’s the Ancient God of the Connate Stone Race!” someone exclaimed. His tone was filled with excitement as if he could see the situation of the Hundred Peak Immortal River formation breaking.
 The ancient god frowned. He couldn’t break through the array formation.
 He continued to try his best, unwilling to give up.
 However, no matter how he collided, it was useless.
 In the Hundred Peak Immortal River, Han Jue sat at the peak of the mountain and preached the Dao. Listening to the distant rumbling, he couldn’t help but frown.
 He wasn’t the only one. The disciples were also vexed.
 Han Jue raised his right hand. The disciples who were paying attention to him couldn’t help but look at it.
 Swish!
 A sword Qi suddenly shot out from Han Jue’s right index finger. In an instant, it shot into the distance and exploded the head of the Stone Race’s Ancient God. Stones splattered everywhere.
 Whoosh
 All the living beings were shocked. “Don’t be afraid! The Ancient God of the Stone Race can’t be killed!” some living beings shouted, wanting to stabilize the troops’ morale.
 The Stone Race’s Ancient God disintegrated at a speed visible to the naked eye. The ten thousand foot tall body directly collapsed.
 Han Jue continued to preach.
 A mere Deity Realm ant wanted to withstand his Pseudo-Sage Dharmic powers?
 The Undying Body was only relative!
 Compared to the undying existence of the Sages, what was the Ancient God of the Stone Race?
 The Ancient God of the Stone Race was destroyed. The surrounding living beings fell silent. No one dared to rush into the Hundred Peak Immortal River anymore.
 Han Jue could finally talk in peace.
 The lecture lasted for fifty years.
 Fifty years later, Han Jue was about to stand up when Li Daokong asked with a voice transmission, “Sect Master, do you need me to go out and resolve this?”
 Han Jue thought for a moment and said, “Sure. Control your limits. Don’t go far, or you’ll be discovered by the Sages.”
 Li Daokong nodded and flew out. Han Jue opened a hole in the Dao Field and let him out.
 Han Jue stood up and walked towards the Daoist temple.
 Along the way, he heard fighting and cries.
 Zenith Heaven was definitely an invincible existence at this time.
 The sound of battle also woke the disciples who were still comprehending the Dao.
 13th Heaven, Heavenly Race’s main hall.
 Ji Xianshen flicked his sleeve and shouted angrily, “What do you mean? The Buddhist Sect wants to declare war on the Heavenly Race?”
 The Heavenly Race members in the hall looked at each other. No one replied first.
 Seeing their expressions, Ji Xianshen was furious!
 The seemingly glorious Heavenly Race was actually completely unstable. He, the Heavenly Ancestor, was completely suppressed. Almost all the experts of the Heavenly Race had their own factions.
 There were even Buddhist cultivators he hated now!
 The Heavenly God General stood up and said, “I’m willing to teach the Buddhist Sect a lesson!”
 Ji Xianshen’s anger eased as he said, “We still have to discuss this matter. The Buddhist Sect openly provoked the prestige of the Heavenly Race. Who else is behind this? It’s worth investigating.
 “By the way, all of you have heard the rumors about the Primordial Purple Qi. Now, all the providence sects are said to possess Primordial Purple Qi. I don’t believe it. How can there be so many opportunities to attain the Dao? Only one Sage has died.
 “What do you think of the devils?”
 Devil Race!
 All the Heavenly Race members in the hall were moved, and the atmosphere became solemn.
