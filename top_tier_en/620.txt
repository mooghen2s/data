 Heavenly Venerate Wufa added, “That’s right. If we Sages break up with Han Jue, who will benefit the most?”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du sighed. “It seems that we have to contact the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End and investigate the background of the Dark Sage King.” “The Dark Forbidden Lord is famous for his curses. The previous calamity disturbed the situation and caused the Heavenly Dao to collapse. It had no choice but to restart. Now, it’s sweeping over again. We have to be careful. The Heavenly Dao can’t withstand a second restart!”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du looked at Qiu Xilai. The other Sages were the same.
 In the previous calamity, Sage Fated Secrets had used the Dao Destruction Mystical Power to eliminate all living beings, causing the providence of the Heavenly Dao to be directly severed at the waist. Now, only Qiu Xilai knew the Dao Destruction Mystical Power.
 If Qiu Xilai betrayed them, he was afraid…
 Qiu Xilai snorted. “Don’t look at me like that. I won’t act recklessly.”
 Soon, the Sages dispersed. The arrival of the Dark Forbidden Lord cast a shadow on their hearts.
 After returning to the Hundred Peak Immortal River, Han Jue sat on the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus and heaved a sigh of relief.
 His acting was amazing!
 Han Jue planned to curse after a while.
 This curse session consumed more than 1.5 quadrillion years of his lifespan. Although he had an octillion years of lifespan, it was indeed very draining
 “It seems that it’s still too difficult to use the Book of Misfortune to curse the Great Dao Sages and Great Dao Divine Spirits to death. I can only think of a way to let them fight among themselves.”
 Han Jue thought silently. No matter what, he felt that he had already done the details very well. There was no need to be anxious. Time passed and thin rivers flowed.
 The twenty-six mighty figures could forget about living well!
 Han Jue closed his eyes and entered his cultivation state again.
 On the other side.
 9th Heaven.
 Fang Liang walked into the Numinous Palace and looked at the already desolate palace. He sighed endlessly.
 Li Daokong, Han Yu, the Divine General, and Meng Xiao followed closely behind.
 Many immortals stood outside the hall. They were all under Fang Liang.
 Li Daokong frowned. It was unknown what he was thinking
 Fang Liang turned around and looked at Han Yu. He smiled and said, “Young friend Han Yu, do you want to enter my Heavenly Dao as a deity?”
 Han Yu looked too similar to Han Jue. He had calculated that this kid was Han Tuo’s descendant and might have Han Jue supporting him from behind.
 Han Yu turned to look at Li Daokong.
 Li Daokong was his master and he listened to him.
 All these years, he had really learned something.
 He worshiped Li Daokong to the extreme.
 Master is really powerful!
 Li Daokong said, “Fang Liang, you created your own Heavenly Dao and even used the Dao Ancestor as your name. Whose side are you on now?”
 Fang Liang was silent. The Divine General did not interrupt. He was following Fang Liang, anyway.
 Fang Liang said faintly, “I want to become the Dao Ancestor. When I control the Heavenly Dao in the future, I won’t forget Grandmaster’s kindness.”
 “Hmph!”
 Li Daokong snorted and left.
 Han Yu hurriedly followed.
 Fang Liang did not ask him to stay. He had chosen his own path. The person he respected the most was still Han Jue, but he didn’t want to stay under him because too many disciples were more outstanding than him and were more favored by Han Jue.
 If he wanted to stand at the peak of the Immortal World, he had to walk his own path.
 Otherwise, without Ji Xianshen, there would still be Murong Qi, Dao Sovereign, Jiang Yi, Zhao Xuanyuan, Su Qi, and other personal disciples who accompanied Han Jue all year round.
 Furthermore, he didn’t want to rely on the power of the Hidden Sect. He wanted to nurture a force that belonged to him.
 The Divine General said, “Will offending the Hidden Sect…”
 Fang Liang said, “Not really. In the future, I will think of a way to repair the relationship between the Heavenly Dao and the Hidden Sect.”
 The Divine General nodded and did not say anything else. He could no longer see through Fang Liang, but he knew that if not for him, he wouldn’t be here.
 “Next, prepare to recruit Heavenly Dao disciples. In the past, the Heavenly Court would become the Heavenly Dao’s Dao Field. To the outside world, we declared that the Heavenly Race is working for the Heavenly Dao and still want to rope in the immortals in the Heavenly Race,” Fang Liang instructed.
 The Divine General understood and immediately went to make arrangements.
𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com Above the sea of clouds, Li Daokong rode on a cloud with a dark expression.
 Han Yu held back the entire way and couldn’t help but ask, “Master, isn’t it a good thing that Heavenly Emperor Fang stood up for Meng Xiao? I heard that the Hidden Sect supported many factions. It’s not considered betraying the Hidden Sect for Heavenly Emperor Fang to create the Heavenly Dao, right?”
 “What do you know? He carries the name of the Dao Ancestor. The Sect Master of the Hidden Sect is a Sage. If he becomes the Dao Ancestor, what identity will the Sect Master of the Hidden Sect have? He’s offending his superior and doesn’t know what’s good for him!”
 Li Daokong snorted. He was extremely dissatisfied with Fang Liang.
 If not for his support along with the immortals of the Hidden Sect, would Ji Xianshen have admitted defeat?
 However, just as he made Ji Xianshen bow his head, Fang Liang announced his independence. Wasn’t he offending them?
 “In the future, you are not allowed to interact with Heavenly Dao disciples. If you are discovered, I will directly expel you from the sect!” Li Daokong said coldly, scaring Han Yu so much that he hurriedly agreed.
 Han Yu looked like Han Jue. Ji Xianshen and Fang Liang would definitely think of a way to rope him in.
 Li Daokong glanced at Han Yu, not knowing what Han Jue’s attitude was.
 However, he believed that Han Jue was definitely paying attention to Han Yu. Otherwise, when the Han family was wiped out back then, Han Jue wouldn’t have acted. Han Yu thought that his master was angry. He smiled apologetically and started to please him.
 Li Daokong enjoyed it as if Han Jue was fawning on him, causing his rock-like Dao heart to jump in joy. Back then, he really wanted to take Han Jue as his disciple!
 In the blink of an eye.
 Two thousand years passed.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and started to preach the Dao to the Hidden Sect disciples.
 The Hidden Sect disciples had yet to react when his Dao voice sounded. The disciples in all corners of the Hundred Peak Immortal River entered a state of epiphany. It was extremely magical.
 A hundred years passed quickly.
 Almost all the disciples had broken through, including Dao Sovereign, who was at the front.
 The current Han Jue represented the Great Dao of Extreme Origin and was completely different from before.
 ISO  After the lecture, Han Jue came to the second Dao Field.
 Han Tuo was already at the Six Mystic Divine Origin Realm and was only a step away from the Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm.
 His potential had been completely unlocked. He was even more ferocious than Yi Tian.
 Han Jue prepared to help him reach the Zenith Heaven Realm and then kick him out to prevent this fellow from exposing the Fiendcelestial force he was nurturing.
 Without waiting for Han Tuo to open his eyes, Han Jue directly preached the Dao to him and guided him to reach the Zenith Heaven Realm.
 Three hundred years later.
 Han Tuo successfully broke through to the Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm and was reborn.
 Before he could react, he was sucked into Han Jue’s sleeve.
 Han Jue returned to the main Dao Field and threw Han Tuo out of the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 After landing, Han Tuo opened his eyes and looked at the Hundred Peak Immortal River. He was stunned and immediately understood.
 “Back then…”
 Han Tuo thought of the scene when he came to visit the Hidden Sect a long time ago. Things were really different now.
 This was the second time he had been chased away, but this time, he was grateful.
 He didn’t blame Han Jue. He chose to walk his own path.
 Han Jue was already taking great care of him by helping him reach the Zenith Heaven Realm.
 Han Tuo knelt down and kowtowed, then turned around and left.
 Under the Fusang Tree.
 The Black Hell Chicken clicked its tongue in wonder. “Master’s son is already at the Zenith Heaven Realm? He’s really not simple.”
 The other personal disciples opened their eyes and looked at Han Tuo outside the Hundred Peak Immortal River with different expressions.
