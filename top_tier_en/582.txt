 Han Jue thought that he had been discovered, but a figure passed through him and walked towards Fang Liang.
 He focused his gaze. Wasn’t this Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du?
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du came forward and knelt in front of Fang Liang. “Greetings, Dao Ancestor.”
 Fang Liang asked indifferently, “How was it?”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du replied, “I’ve already found that Chaotic Fiendcelestial. I can put it in the Heavenly Dao at any time to fight against the Son of the Immeasurable Calamity.”
 “Yes, when the Son of the Immeasurable Calamity steps into the Pseudo-Sage Realm, I’ll release the Chaotic Fiendcelestial.”
 “Understood.”
 Han Jue was curious.
 Release the Chaotic Fiendcelestial?
 Who was the Son of the Immeasurable Calamity?
 For some reason, Han Jue felt that it would be Han Tuo.
 After the illusion ended, Han Jue immediately asked who this Son of the Immeasurable Calamity was.
 (2 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 (Yi Tian: Rank One Immortal Emperor, Son of the Heavenly Dao, Chaotic Fiendcelestial, the great providence bearer chosen by the Heavenly Dao. He carries the mission of unifying the Immortal World.) Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief.
 Fortunately, it was not his son.
 From the looks of it, Fang Liang was not targeting the Hidden Sect.
 Not bad.
 Han Jue shook his head and threw away his distracting thoughts. He started cultivating.
 Time passed as the Immortal World changed day by day. From time to time, mighty figures would appear. The Immortal World became more and more exciting.
 The legend of the Sages became vaguer and vaguer. The gazes of all living beings also landed beside him.
 Li Daokong, Shi Dudao, Ji Xianshen, Jiang Dugu, the Golden Crow Demon Emperor, the Dragon King of the Eastern Sea, the Divine Might Buddha, and the others became the top and most prestigious mighty figures in the Immortal World.
 As for Han Tuo, although he had a good relationship with Yi Tian, he kept a low profile and was not famous.
 On this day.
 Zhou Fan returned.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and moved him into the Hundred Peak Immortal River. He also checked his attributes panel. 1,720 years had passed.
 Zhou Fan’s return caused the personal disciples to gather. The Fusang Tree became lively.
 Han Jue didn’t pay attention to Zhou Fan but checked his emails.
 (Your grand-disciple Fang Liang has fused with the Heavenly Dao Origin. His cultivation has increased greatly.]
 (Your good friend, Heavenly Venerate Wufa, was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure.]
 (Your good friend Emperor Xiao was cursed by a mysterious curse.)
 (Your good friend Huang Zuntian has recruited disciples. The providence of the Jie School has increased, and his cultivation has increased greatly.)
 (Your good friend Pan Xin was attacked by the ancient Master of Calamity.]
 [Your good friend Shi Dudao was attacked by your good friend Li Daokong.)
 (Your good friend Li Xuan’ao was attacked by your good friend Jiang Dugu and was severely injured.]
 The level of his friends was too high. It was very difficult to see a situation where the number of attacks exceeded ten thousand. When mighty figures fought, it was almost always a one-on-one battle. After all, at that level, there were not dozens of people joining forces.
 Dozens of Zenith Heavens ganging up on a Zenith Heaven cultivator?
 It was a rare event.
 Han Jue was attracted by Huang Zuntian’s recent situation. This fellow had begun to develop the Jie School, and his providence had also increased greatly. He was quite something.
 The Jie School was about to suffer!
 According to Han Jue’s understanding, this fellow was only suitable for internal strife and not management.
 Back then, Huang Zuntian’s sect had fallen at Han Jue’s feet. That was also the stepping stone for him to open up the path of invincibility.
 However, the Jie School’s calamity had nothing to do with Han Jue.
 Several days later.
 Zhou Fan came to visit him.
 Han Jue let him in.
 After bowing, Zhou Fan said, “Master, an array formation has appeared in the Chaotic City. It can lead to the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End. The other sects have already sent disciples there to learn. The Hidden Sect has no background in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End, but the Sages have sent me an invitation. They say that the Dao Field in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End can accept disciples of the Hidden Sect and comprehend the Great Dao.
 “This matter is too big. I don’t dare to rashly decide, so I came back to ask you.”
 Han Jue asked, “Why not say it through the Myriad Worlds Projection?”
 Zhou Fan chuckled. “I wanted to come back and rest. The Chaotic City is really boring. The disciples of the various sects look harmonious, but they are actually wary of each other. It’s meaningless.”
 Han Jue said, “The Chaotic City is very important. You have to return after resting for a period of time.”
 “I understand. What about the Dao Field of the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End?”
 “No, reject the Sages’ kind intentions. My Hidden Sect will stay in the Heavenly Dao and not involve itself with the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End.”
 “Will the difference increase?”
 “Hmph, if it’s really that easy, why didn’t their backing in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End attack when they were in danger?”
 “You mean…”
 “You can leave.”
𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com “Alright!”
 Zhou Fan stood up and left.
 After walking out of the Daoist temple, he was still thinking about the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End.
 He suddenly saw Zhang Jue. “I’m really confused. I don’t even know my master’s background. Why should I worry?”
 Zhou Fan shook his head and laughed. Then, he stopped thinking about it.
 He believed in Han Jue!
 Several months later, the Hundred Peak Immortal River welcomed another visitor.
 “Is Han Jue here?”
 The newcomer stood on the cliff and shouted.
 Han Jue opened his eyes.
 An old friend.
 Zhang Guxing.
 He was once a prodigy of the Divine Palace. Later, he guarded the Sword Dao River. Han Jue even recognized him as his elder brother.
 After thinking about it, Han Jue moved Zhang Guxing into his Daoist temple.
 Zhang Guxing was only at the One Mystic Divine Origin Realm. In Han Jue’s eyes, he was no different from an ant. The only difference was that he had seen this ant before.
 Back then, in order to save Zhang Guxing, Han Jue cursed his enemy to death.
 They were even. The reason why Han Jue met him was mainly that he thought that he had taken care of Han Tuo.
 Zhang Guxing was stunned when he saw him.
 Han Jue was also sizing him up. After not seeing him for tens of thousands of years, he looked even older.
 Now, it was impossible for Han Jue to call him Brother anymore. He couldn’t bear it, either.
 Zhang Guxing came back to his senses. With a complicated expression, he said, “Greetings, Immeasurable Merit Divine Might Heavenly Sage.”
 Han Jue smiled. “Why are you bowing to me? How have you been?”
 He could deduce what had happened to Zhang Guxing recently, but he felt that there was no need to do anything. Some things could be done easily, but sometimes knowing everything made it boring.
 Zhang Guxing smiled bitterly. “No, that’s why I came to find you. To be honest, I don’t want to get help from old friends, but I had no choice but to look for you.”
 Han Jue waved his hand, and a mat appeared behind Zhang Guxing.
 Zhang Guxing sat down and began to talk about his difficulties.
 It turned out that he wanted to recreate the Divine Palace and had already invited Han Tuo, Immortal Emperor Samsara, and other genius mighty figures. However, every time he created the Providence Sect, it was isolated by the Sages of the Heavenly Dao’s providence and had never succeeded.
 Regarding Han Tuo, Zhang Guxing didn’t hide anything. He guessed that Han Tuo was Han Jue’s son, so he had taught him the Sword Dao Mystical Power and even saved him. After understanding Han Tuo’s understanding of his father, he was smart enough not to expose
 him.
 Han Jue didn’t expect Immortal Emperor Samsara to also join the Divine Palace. On second thought, it was probably because of Han Tuo.
 Immortal Emperor Samsara had watched Han Jue grow up. If even Zhang Guxing could guess Han Tuo’s identity, how could Immortal Emperor Samsara not?
 Immortal Emperor Samsara should also want to use the Divine Palace to officially step into the stage of the Immortal World and fight for providence.
 Han Jue pinched his fingers to deduce and deduced that the Sage who stopped Zhang Guxing from recreating the Divine Palace was the South Extreme Heavenly Venerate.
