 Han Jue raised his eyebrows and heaved a sigh of relief.
 That’s good!
 It seemed that he was really thinking too much.
 Could it be that the Heavenly Emperor was not in danger in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End, but in the Dark Forbidden Zone?
 Forget it!
 It was fine as long as there was no greater conspiracy!
 Han Jue closed his eyes and continued to comprehend the Great Dao of Extreme Origin.
 Time passed.
 Year after year, the number of Heavenly Devils around the Hundred Peak Immortal River also increased.
 A hundred years later, the number of Heavenly Devils near the Hundred Peak Immortal River exceeded a million.
 Li Xuan’ao came to visit him.
 Han Jue let him enter the Daoist temple.
 “Sect Master, the Heavenly Devils have already made the disciples in the sect panic. Should we arrange for them to go out and destroy the Heavenly Devils?” Li Xuan’ao bowed and asked respectfully.
 Han Jue said calmly, “The Heavenly Devils can’t enter the Dao Field. There’s nothing to be afraid of.”
 Li Xuan’ao hesitated.
 Han Jue asked, “What do you want to ask? Just say it.”
 Li Xuan’ao took a deep breath and said, “It’s been a long time since you preached the Dao. It must be because of the Heavenly Devils. Many years ago, the Sages joined forces to deal with the Heavenly Devils. However, as more and more Heavenly Devils appear, and the Sages did not do anything, I’m afraid that the Sages…”
 He did not continue.
 Han Jue said, “What are you trying to say?”
 Li Xuan’ao said, “Such an opportunity is the time for my Hidden Sect to prove itself. If the Hidden Sect can kill the Heavenly Devils, all living beings will owe us great karma. I feel that you might be the strongest Sage in the world. Otherwise, those Sages would have long come to find trouble. Why don’t you take action and end this calamity?”
 Han Jue didn’t say anything and stared at him calmly.
 Li Xuan’ao lowered his head nervously.
Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com Han Jue slowly stood up.
 “Prepare for the lecture.”
 This sentence resounded throughout the Hidden Sect.
 The million disciples became excited and surged towards the place of the lecture.
 As usual, he would preach for a hundred years.
 In a hundred years, most of the disciples had made breakthroughs.
 In the past, Han Jue would leave directly after the lecture, but not this time.
 He sat on the top of the mountain and looked down at the million disciples immersed in Dao Comprehension. They were all entranced.
 He began to observe the entire Immortal World.
 Corpses were everywhere and blood flowed like a sea.
 The Heavenly Devils spread throughout the hundred regions of the Immortal World and even began to invade the various mortal worlds.
 The Heavenly Dao lifeforms were in danger.
 Sages couldn’t defeat Dao Heavenly Devil, and the living beings of the Heavenly Dao couldn’t defeat billions of the Heavenly Devils.
 Han Jue was silent.
 After a long while…
 “Wait,” Han Jue suddenly said, waking all the disciples.
 The disciples looked up at the high and mighty Sect Master with reverence.
 After everyone sobered up, Han Jue slowly said, “The Heavenly Devil Calamity began in the 33rd Heaven. The Sages joined forces and passed down their providence to Sage Qiu Xilai. He and the leader of the Heavenly Devils fought outside the Chaos for some time.
 “What do you think of this calamity?”
 The disciples looked at each other.
 The in-name disciples did not dare to speak, and the personal disciples did not answer immediately.
 At this moment, a disciple flew into the sky and knelt down in the air, bowing to Han Jue.
 Chu Shiren!
 “Grandmaster, I think that the Hidden Sect can no longer hide. It’s time to take action. Previously, it was the Immeasurable Calamity. We could avoid it. The Heavenly Dao can be restarted, but the Heavenly Devils came from outside the chaos. The Sages are all in danger. If the Heavenly Devil’s slaughter succeeds, where can we live?” Chu Shiren cupped his fists and said firmly.
 With that said, many voices echoed in the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 “That’s right. The Heavenly Devils are detestable. I saw them tear apart living beings with my own eyes. They’re extremely cruel.”
 “These Heavenly Devils are very evil at a glance. We can’t kill them at all.”
 “If the Immortal World is destroyed and the Heavenly Dao is gone, won’t the Hidden Sect still have to face the Heavenly Devils?”
 “That’s right. Isn’t the goal of our cultivation to survive? If the Immortal World falls, where will we live?”
 “Senior Chu said well. We should destroy the Heavenly Devils!”
 “That’s right, that’s right!”
 Hearing the indignant disciples’ words, Han Jue sighed.
 He had wanted to kill the Dao Heavenly Devil after breaking through, but he was still some time away.
 If he waited any longer, the Immortal World would really be massacred.
 Han Jue slowly stood up. Seeing him stand up, all the disciples shut up and didn’t dare to say anything
 He slowly raised his right hand and pointed his index finger at the sky.
 The Sun and Moon Yin-Yang Protection revolved behind him. Divine light illuminated the Hundred Peak Immortal River. At this moment, he was so majestic.
 “Everything in the world is my sword.”
 Han Jue’s voice sounded. This time, it was not only the Hundred Peak Immortal River, but all the worlds in the myriad worlds could hear
 it.
 The disciples of the Hidden Sect held their breaths as they stared at him.
 In an instant, the world shook!
 The sea of clouds in the sky transformed into white swords one after another. Stone swords with sharp auras condensed on the mountains on the ground. Countless living beings were frightened and the billions of Heavenly Devils were uneasy.
 Such a scene occurred in every corner of the Immortal World and mortal worlds!
 A mountain transformed into a sword!
 The sea of blood transformed into swords!
 The trees transformed into swords!
 Flowers turned into swords!
 Dust turned into swords!
 Falling leaves turned into swords!
 Apart from the land itself, all things that were not sentient became swords!
 Such a scene shocked all living beings.
 The Hidden Sect disciples in the Hundred Peak Immortal River also saw the situation outside the Dao Field. All of them opened their mouths wide and were dumbfounded.
 They all heard Han Jue’s voice, which meant that this change in the world was caused by him.
 The Sect Master attacked to destroy the Heavenly Devils!
 Dao Sovereign, Li Yao, Zhao Xuanyuan, Zhou Fan, and the others were all excited.
 What a domineering Mystical Power!
 The disheveled Han Tuo and the bloody Han Ming looked up at the huge swords around them with disbelief.
 They hid in the mountains, but the surrounding mountains and trees turned into swords.
 “Erm…”
 Han Tuo couldn’t understand. He felt that the voice just now was familiar, but he couldn’t tell why.
 Han Jue used the Sage Voice. It was domineering and imposing. In addition, Han Tuo had not seen his father for a long time. He had experienced countless living beings in thousands of years. He had already forgotten his father’s voice. Even if he did, it was different from Han Jue’s Sage Voice.
 On the other hand, Han Ming clearly remembered.
 “He attacked… he actually…”
 Han Ming had a complicated expression as his heart trembled.
 Under their gazes, all the swords around them soared into the sky and attacked in all directions.
 One Heavenly Devil after another was destroyed by the swords formed by all things in the world, scaring the other Heavenly Devils away.
 After their bodies shattered, they directly turned into dust. There was no chance of recovery at all!
 In an instant, on the ground of the myriad worlds in the universe, countless sword shadows sped forward. The blood of the Heavenly Devils splattered, turning into a bloody mist that filled the sky. On the bare ground, all living beings looked up at this miracle. Shock, surprise, and sorrow from having survived the calamity all surged into their hearts.
 More and more living beings knelt down and worshiped the sky. Some also began to wail.
 Finally, a messiah had arrived to save the world!
