 “This is not ambition. This is to save the Heavenly Dao and all living beings in the world!”
 “I’m not that capable.”
 “If we join forces, we can definitely do it!” Han Jue cursed silently. How ridiculous was this guy?
 Han Jue said, “Then, what do you want to do?”
 Li Muyi said, “Qiu Xilai is currently attempting the Dao Integration. Although he’s hiding it very well, I plan to support the Hidden Sect to occupy the Heavenly Dao’s providence. Even if Qiu Xilai is attempting the Dao Integration, with your command over the Hidden Sect, you can directly disband them before the battle begins. Of course, you will pretend to disband and eliminate the Hidden Sect’s providence. The Heavenly Dao’s providence will end up in chaos and order will be lost. Qiu Xilai’s cultivation will definitely plummet, eliminating him and the Heavenly Dao Spirit in his body.”
 Han Jue chuckled. What a good plan.
 Killing two birds with one stone? Han Jue almost asked, ‘Do you think I’m stupid?’
 He had to hold back. How could a Sage be crude? He said, “May I ask what the Sage will do? Are you only supporting the Hidden Sect?”
 Did the Hidden Sect still need Li Muyi’s support? Screw off!
 “I’ll directly let the Human School join the Hidden Sect. When dealing with Qiu Xilai, I’ll also participate. How about that?” Li Muyi replied calmly.
 This was very sincere. Regardless of whether it was true or not, if the Human School joined the Hidden Sect, it would be able to suppress all the Sage Sects in reputation.
 Unfortunately, Han Jue didn’t want to take in the Human School, and he even hated it.
 The Human School’s foundation was truly deep. The time it had been in existence was immeasurable. It was even older than the Immortal World, let alone the ancient Human School in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End.
 The Human School in the Immortal World was more like the outer sect of the true Human School.
 Han Jue said, “I’ll consider this.”
 Li Muyi frowned. “If you say that you want to consider, it means that you refuse. What are you dissatisfied with? You don’t want to find the ancestor or cooperate with me. Then, tell me a way. The Heavenly Dao has a spirit. If news of this spreads, all living beings will definitely be terrified.
 “From now on, it will no longer be a situation where Sages restrain each other. Instead, it will be the Heavenly Dao’s dictatorship. Your existence is definitely a thorn in the Heavenly Dao’s eyes, even if you once saved it.” Han Jue said, “I just don’t want to become everyone’s target. Find another Sage.”
 With that, Han Jue left the dream.
 33rd Heaven, Human School Dao Field.
 Li Muyi opened his eyes and frowned.
 “This fellow is really stubborn. I don’t believe that you really don’t have any ambitions.”
 Li Muyi muttered to himself, feeling very unhappy.
 This was not the first time he begged Han Jue. The latter had never given him face.
 Since Han Jue was unwilling to agree, he could only find other Sages.
 Inside the Daoist temple.
 Han Jue snorted and muttered, “Trying to trick me again. Do I need you to kill the Heavenly Dao’s spirit?”
 He already had a plan.
 After Qiu Xilai succeeded in his Dao Integration, he would capture him and bring him to the Primordial Heavenly Prison. Then, he would definitely purify him and eliminate the Heavenly Dao Spirit. It had to be said that the Absolute Purification of the Primordial Heavenly Prison was too impressive.
 Han Jue even started to look forward to Qiu Xilai’s successful Dao Integration.
 Continue cultivating!
 He had to break through as soon as possible!
 Han Jue could already fight with a Freedom Sage. When he broke through again, he would definitely be able to kill some weaker Freedom Sages.
 After thinking, Han Jue closed his eyes and focused on cultivating.
 Time passed.
 Life was like a dream. A mighty cultivator dreamed of three thousand things. The empire in the mortal world changed and mountains and rivers shifted.
 When heroes appeared in the Immortal World, the mortal worlds below also began to exert their strength. Ascenders appeared one after another and slaughtered their way to the Immortal World, revealing their sharpness.
 At this moment, the living beings in the Immortal World realized that other than the Immortal World, other worlds were also very powerful. At the same time, they also felt that the mortal worlds were suitable for living and cultivation.
Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com In just three thousand years, more than ten million living beings had ascended from the mortal world. The number of living beings in the Immortal World had also reached a very impressive level, like the Immortal World before the calamity.
 Han Jue opened his eyes.
 He was already very close to breaking through.
 Awesome!
 Han Jue couldn’t wait to break through, but Han Zuitian had already asked to see him more than ten times.
 Han Jue hadn’t received him for several years. Now was his chance.
 He let Han Zuitian in.
 Even before he spoke, Han Jue knew what he wanted to say.
 It was time to send talents out or recruit new disciples.
 Indeed, another ten thousand in-name disciples’ cultivation levels had reached the limit and could no longer increase.
 Han Jue allowed them to leave and serve the Heavenly Race.
 “Grandmaster, should we recruit another batch of disciples? Many cities were established near the Hundred Peak Immortal River. I remember that the nearby three regions have long been divided by the Heavenly Race to us. Now that they are occupied by other races and sects, it’s really unpleasant,” Han Zuitian asked expectantly.
 Han Jue said calmly, “I won’t take in any disciples for the time being. The Hidden Sect wants the best. As for the territory outside, it’s nothing.” “But…”
 “No buts. You can leave. I’m not satisfied with your cultivation. You have to reach the Deity Realm in ten thousand years. Otherwise, don’t even think about leaving.”
 “Ten thousand years? I…”
 “Yes?”
 “Yes…”
 Han Zuitian left in fear.
 This kid had already reached the Emperor Realm not long ago, but to cross the threshold of a Rank Nine Immortal Emperor in ten thousand years, he felt that it was almost impossible.
 Several days later, Han Jue sent out the ten thousand in-name disciples Han Zuitian had arranged.
 These were all Immortal Emperors!
 Ten thousand Immortal Emperors left the Dao Field, immediately attracting the heavenly lightning
 Han Jue clearly sensed that the Heavenly Dao’s providence was changing.
 An Immortal Emperor was nothing, but ten thousand was truly ridiculous.
 The ten thousand in-name disciples of the Hidden Sect looked up at the lightning and smiled proudly.
 They had cultivated diligently for tens of thousands of years just for today to appear!
 “Let’s go to the Heavenly Race!”
 The leader of the in-name disciples shouted. The ten thousand disciples were like sharp arrows breaking through the thunderclouds.
 At the same time.
 33rd Heaven, Buddhist Dao Field.
 Qiu Xilai opened his eyes and frowned. He muttered, “Another ten thousand Immortal Emperors. How many Immortal Emperors are hiding in the Hidden Sect?”
 He remembered that the number of Deity Realm disciples in the Hidden Sect was also very exaggerated.
 Why were there so many powerful disciples in the seemingly low-profile Hidden Sect?
 He had been observing the Hundred Peak Immortal River. It had been tens of thousands of years since it had recruited disciples. Could these disciples be Connate lifeforms that Han Jue had casually recruited back then?
 That was impossible.
 Even Connate lifeforms had differing potentials. To become an Immortal Emperor after tens of thousands of years was already the potential of a genius.
 At this moment, the Heavenly Dao Spirit appeared and said, “The Heavenly Dao’s providence has changed again. Because of these ten thousand Hidden Sect Immortal Emperors, the overall providence of the Heavenly Dao has increased greatly. If you want to deal with the Hidden Sect, don’t force yourself. The Heavenly Dao’s rules have already begun to approach them.”
 Qiu Xilai said angrily, “You can’t control the Heavenly Dao and still call yourself the Heavenly Dao. I even suspect that you’re not the Heavenly Dao’s true spirit.”
 “How can that be?” the Heavenly Dao Spirit said angrily. Qiu Xilai sighed.
 For some reason, he felt that something was wrong with the Heavenly Dao Spirit recently. It became more and more vulgar. It did not have the transcendence of the Heavenly Dao and was more like a mortal.
