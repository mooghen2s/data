 Just like how mortals couldn’t imagine what was outside the universe.
 When strength reached the limit, it was absolutely impossible to differentiate between high and low. Sages were omnipotent and undying. How strong were existences that surpassed them?
 Even Han Jue couldn’t imagine it.
 Han Jue asked curiously, “Is there no mighty figure who doesn’t rely on merit to attain the Dao?”
 “Yes, you have the aura of the Dao of Karma on you. You must have been to the Great Ultimate Hall beyond the 33rd level. Ancestor Xitian is the one.”
 Empress Houtu’s answer shocked Han Jue.
 Was Ancestor Xitian that impressive?
 Han Jue asked, “What about the Dao Ancestor?”
 Empress Houtu smiled and said, “Dao Ancestor? That’s definitely the top existence in cultivation. A long time ago, he fused with the Heavenly Dao. He has not appeared for the last five Immeasurable Calamities. His traces are difficult to track even for Sages.”
 Han Jue was even more curious about the Dao Ancestor now.
 He hadn’t appeared for the last five Immeasurable Calamities, so how did the Heavenly Emperor meet the Dao Ancestor?
 Could it be that the Heavenly Emperor had never seen him before, but the inheritance of the Heavenly Court let him know that they had the backing of the Dao Ancestor?
 It was very likely.
 Han Jue always felt that the Heavenly Emperor had a habit of bragging and was often slapped in the face.
 Before the calamity began, the Heavenly Emperor had boasted several times that he wanted to destroy the Demon Court and the Jie School. In the end, he had turned enemies into friends.
 “Do you want to come out and meet them?” Empress Houtu asked.
 Han Jue replied, “Forget it. Let them cultivate well. I don’t expect much.” “Alright, that’s all. If the Nine Nether Purgatory is in trouble, I’ll help. Don’t worry.”
 After Empress Houtu said that, her aura completely vanished.
 Han Jue retracted his divine sense and fell into deep thought.
 This event was very meaningful. This was the first time Han Jue came into contact with the existence of the Heavenly Dao Merit. It also gave him a preliminary understanding of the Sages and the Heavenly Dao.
 At this moment…
 A loud laugh sounded, “Brat, I’ve finally found you. Let’s see if you can still hide!”
 Boom!
 The formation of Hidden Sect Island was attacked. The attacker was Pan Xin.
 Pan Xin actually wanted to barge in!
 Han Jue was furious. Was there something wrong with this fellow?
 With a thought, he immediately sent Lü Bu to try his luck.
 In the dark void, Pan Xin kept waving his hand at a stone when a figure suddenly appeared in front of him. It was Lü Bu.
 Pan Xin widened his eyes and suddenly retreated. His expression darkened as he gritted his teeth. “Zu Tu, why are you here?”
 Lü Bu was expressionless. Without another word, he attacked.
 Two vast Dharmic powers collided, shaking the void of the Nine Nether Purgatory. It stirred endless negative karma and swayed like a dragon.
 Pan Xin shouted, “You’re actually hiding here! I’m not playing with you anymore!”
 With that, he fled.
 Han Jue was speechless.
 This fellow was really timid.
 Han Jue had used the simulation trial to copy Pan Xin’s cultivation. After confirming that he had really escaped, he called Lü Bu back and started the simulation trial himself. He fought Pan Xin!
 He wanted to assess his strength.
 With the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus, Pan Xin couldn’t break through the defense of the Heavenly Dao Supreme Treasure, but he could still injure Han Jue by penetrating it.
 Several minutes later, the defense of the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus shattered and Han Jue was insta-killed.
 Huh!
 This fellow should be stronger than Zu Tu.
 He could be part of the first row of listeners in the Great Ultimate Hall.
 But why was he so afraid of Zu Tu? Was it because he was timid, or did Zu Tu have another background?
 Han Jue felt that it was the latter.
 He had deduced the future. Zu Tu was related to the person from Nüwa Imperial Palace and was probably supported by it.
nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎 Thinking of this, Han Jue discovered that he hadn’t used the derivation function for a long time.
 So be it!
 “I want to know who the greatest winner of this Immeasurable Calamity is.”
 Han Jue thought in his heart that after the calamity ended, there would definitely be more than one person who would win. There might be allies, subordinates, and so on. It could be said that when one person obtained the Dao, all his friends would ascend to the heavens.
 (A billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?)
 So much?
 Han Jue silently chose to continue.
 Then, he felt dizzy.
 When Han Jue opened his eyes again, he saw the future sky. There were green mountains and rivers around him, and the scenery was as beautiful as a painting.
 He heaved a sigh of relief. Compared to the previous apocalyptic scenes, this was undoubtedly wonderful.
 It seemed that he had succeeded in saving the world.
 Oh, everyone.
 Do you know what the Dark Forbidden Lord you despised did for you? Han Jue felt that he was very noble. He silently changed the situation of the Heavenly Dao and saved the Immortal World and the heavens again and again.
 At this moment…
 Han Jue saw two figures land.
 His eyes widened.
 They were Han Jue and Dao Comprehension Sword!
 This Han Jue wore a white robe and was handsome. His every move emitted a terrifying aura stronger than the Heavenly Emperor.
 Dao Comprehension Sword had a cold temperament. She walked beside Han Jue and was not humble at all, unlike her current self in the Connate Cave Abode.
 The two of them landed halfway up the mountain and turned to look at the world.
 Dao Comprehension Sword asked, “How long can your Mystical Power last?”
 The future Han Jue smiled and said, “For eternity.”
 He raised his arms and stretched. He smiled and said, “I used my Mystical Power to trap all living beings. I’m the Heavenly Dao now!
 “From now on, I will rule the Heavenly Dao. All living beings will no longer face calamity unless I don’t like them.”
 His tone was filled with smugness.
 Han Jue frowned.
 Was he so arrogant in the future?
 What was that Mystical Power?
 The stellar primordial world in the depths of his soul?
 Something was wrong! He couldn’t be like this! This fellow isn’t me?
 Han Jue was extremely afraid. Could he have been possessed?
 “Those Sages are already gone, but I feel that it’s not so easy to replace the Heavenly Dao. Otherwise, why hasn’t this happened in the past?” Dao Comprehension Sword frowned.
 The future Han Jue smiled disdainfully and said, “After the calamity ended, other than you, me, and the living beings I control in the Immortal World, all the other characters are dead. Who can threaten us? The Heavenly Dao is only a set of laws!” Dao Comprehension Sword shook her head.
 The future Han Jue smiled and said, “By the way, should we create a Heavenly Court and let you become the Heavenly Emperor?”
 Dao Comprehension Sword snorted. “It’s meaningless. You better be careful of that fellow. He has a close relationship with the Heavenly Court. You slaughtered the Heavenly Court and his disciples. He will definitely not let you go. He must be hiding in the dark. He might come and find trouble with you at any time.”
 “I know him too well. He’s afraid of death. He won’t provoke the current me.” The future Han Jue shook his head and laughed.
 Han Jue realized something and was about to continue watching when the scene shattered.
 When his consciousness returned to the Connate Cave Abode, Han Jue opened his eyes and frowned.
 Who was that dog?
 From their conversation, the Heavenly Court had been destroyed!
 Wasn’t the fellow hiding in the dark Han Jue himself?
 This fellow was indeed not him!
 Han Jue was furious. Why was there another problem now?
 Where did this fake Han Jue and Dao Comprehension Sword come from?
 Han Jue thought silently, “I want to know who will become me and Dao Comprehension Sword!”
 (2 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Eh?
 Why did it double!
 Han Jue frowned even more.
 He didn’t like to be trapped by schemes. He wanted to see through everything!
 Continue!
