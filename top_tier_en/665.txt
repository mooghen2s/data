 It seemed that this Inauspicious Deity was very strong. It was very likely one of the top existences among the Inauspicious Deities. Han Jue decided to visit Divine Lord Peacock in his dreams.
 In any case, this fellow was severely injured, but he did not die. This meant that the Inauspicious Deity did not want to kill him. Divine Lord Peacock was probably imprisoned. In the dream.
 Divine Lord Peacock suddenly opened his eyes. Seeing that it was the Dark Forbidden Lord, he heaved a sigh of relief. Han Jue smiled faintly. “What? You can’t do that?” Divine Lord Peacock gritted his teeth and said, “Your disciple is the Inauspicious Divine Emperor? Very good, no wonder you’re called the Dark Forbidden Lord. Even the strongest existence in the Dark Forbidden Zone is your disciple!”
 Han Jue was silent.
 What the hell? It turned out that the existence who attacked Divine Lord Peacock was called the Inauspicious Divine Emperor.
 From this name, it was obvious that he was an ominous existence. What a chaotic era. Anything could give birth to a supreme expert. Seeing Han Jue’s silence, Divine Lord Peacock cursed. “You don’t follow the rules. What happened to fighting someone at the same realm? This fellow even brought helpers!”
 Han Jue thought of the number of times Divine Lord Peacock was attacked and couldn’t help but mourn.
 This fellow was really miserable.
 Han Jue asked, “Do you know what realm the Inauspicious Divine Emperor is at?”
 “Nonsense. I don’t know, but can he still be at the same realm as me?” “Hehe.”
 “What do you mean?”
 Divine Lord Peacock had a look of disbelief. In his opinion, the Inauspicious Divine Emperor was an existence like a Great Dao Sage or even stronger! But on second thought, if he was really that strong, he wouldn’t have fought with him for so long… Could it be… Divine Lord Peacock’s heart skipped a beat, and his expression gradually darkened. Han Jue asked, “My disciple has a strange personality. How is he going to deal with you?” Divine Lord Peacock gritted his teeth and cursed. “How would I know! He sealed me on a bronze ship. I asked him why, but he ignored me! He’s like a mute! However, there are still two people on the ship. They are the two young Divine Generals of the Evil Heavenly Emperor. Damn it, why aren’t they also sealed? They are so weak and still dare to mock me. If not for me being sealed, I could have destroyed their bodies and souls with a breath!”
Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates Evil Heavenly Emperor…  Could it be that the Evil Heavenly Emperor had asked the Inauspicious Divine Emperor to capture Divine Lord Peacock? That should be the case. Otherwise, why would the Evil Heavenly Emperor’s subordinates be alive? Han Jue said, “Don’t worry. The Evil Heavenly Emperor will treat you well.”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor was not as strong as Divine Lord Peacock. If he really wanted to kill Divine Lord Peacock, he could just let the Inauspicious Divine Emperor kill him. With Han Jue’s understanding of the Evil Heavenly Emperor, this fellow probably wanted to subdue Divine Lord Peacock.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor loved to recruit prodigies!
 “What do you mean? Could it be that the Evil Heavenly Emperor is also your…” Divine Lord Peacock widened his eyes in disbelief. Han Jue was secretly pleased. Aren’t you very confident? He was finally shocked! Seeing that Han Jue didn’t answer, Divine Lord Peacock’s imagination ran wild.
 The Dark Forbidden Lord had cursed the Chaotic Deity and Cundi to death. Under him were the leaders of major factions like the Inauspicious Divine Emperor and the Evil Heavenly Emperor… Gasp
 Even the arrogant Divine Lord Peacock was shocked.
 The Dark Forbidden Lord was so strong and controlled such a powerful force, but he had been hiding behind the scenes. What did he want? Divine Lord Peacock suddenly looked up and asked, “Could you be the Primordial Fiendcelestial that the Dao Ancestor once mentioned?”
 Han Jue said calmly, “Primordial Fiendcelestial? Who does he think he is?”
 Damn it!
 This fellow had really guessed correctly! Divine Lord Peacock said disdainfully, “You really know how to brag. Are you going to let me go or not? I’m convinced, okay? Tell the Inauspicious Divine Emperor to let go of me. I’m going to kill those two Divine Generals!” Han Jue was worried that the two weak Divine Generals were Han Tuo and Yi Tian. These two were like a pair of pants and had always been inseparable. “Don’t hurt them. I’ll let you go when it’s time.” “What do you mean? Not letting go? You still want the Evil Heavenly Emperor to humiliate me?”
 Han Jue remained silent.
 Divine Lord Peacock was furious. “Hmph! You look down on me! I don’t need your help to speak! I will definitely destroy the Inauspicious Divine Emperor!”
 Boom
 The dream shattered.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and shook his head with a smile.
 Silly peacock. If he was really my disciple, I’d definitely let you go. But he’s not! Han Jue looked outside the Heavenly Dao again, and his gaze landed on the Primordial Origin Coffin.
 Tsk tsk, why didn’t the Inauspicious Divine Emperor find this fellow?
 It seemed that Primordial Origin was stronger than the Inauspicious Divine Emperor and he did not want to provoke him. On that day. Xing Hongxuan suddenly came. Han Jue had a headache because this woman had finally reached the Zenith Heaven Realm. Xing Hongxuan was not a mortal, to begin with. After reincarnating and exchanging for a new bloodline, it was not unreasonable for her to become a Zenith Heaven cultivator.
 Han Jue thought for a moment and let her enter the Daoist temple. The Strange Deity was chased out. As soon as she entered, Xing Hongxuan quickly walked up and started touching him. “It’s been tens of thousands of years. I can’t hold it in anymore!” “What nonsense!”
 “Husband, why are you being so awkward?” “You’re a Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal, after all. How can you be obsessed with mortal desires?”
 “Don’t you want to?”
 “I mean, it’s not that I don’t want to…”
 Several years later. Xing Hongxuan’s expression was bitter. “Husband, are you going back on your word?”
 Han Jue asked helplessly, “Must we have a child?”
 “Yes, just take it as my wish.” “Do you want the child’s potential to be poor or good?” “Of course, it has to be good. It’s definitely going to be the number one talent in the world!” “Not necessarily. You’ll drag down my bloodline.” Xing Hongxuan was stunned. Her eyes immediately filled with tears as she bit her lips. She looked truly pitiful.
 Han Jue had no choice but to listen to her. After a few more months, Xing Hongxuan left. After so many attempts, she was finally pregnant. As for this child’s potential, Han Jue couldn’t guarantee it. Ever since he helped Han Tuo increase his potential, his control over his bloodline had become blurry. There was some force restraining the reproduction of powerful bloodlines. Then, Han Jue began to cultivate in seclusion. A thousand years passed in a flash. Han Jue opened his eyes and looked at Xing Hongxuan. He frowned.
 Eh?
 She hasn’t given birth yet? Under his gaze, Xing Hongxuan was cultivating. Her abdomen was flat and she did not look pregnant. However, Han Jue could sense that the child in her womb had vitality and was nurturing a new soul. Nezha had been born after three years and was already a freak. Han Jue’s son had stayed in the womb for a thousand years and still didn’t come out. What was this?
 Han Jue suddenly became interested in his new child.
 Could it be that he had won a prize? Did he really create an extraordinary genius?
