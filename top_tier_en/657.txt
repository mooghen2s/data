 Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal!
𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com The Heavenly God General’s eyelids twitched. He shouted, “Fight!” Thousands of Heavenly troops used their Mystical Powers one after another. The spatial hole behind the ten thousand foot tall giant quickly expanded. Countless living beings of the Calamity Race were like a school of carps crossing the river as they attacked without care. A huge battle quickly erupted! The surging waves of the Yellow Spring couldn’t calm down for a long time. The Calamity Race directly sent thirteen Pseudo-Sages as the vanguard, with hundreds of Zenith Heaven Golden Immortals behind them.
 Their momentum was huge, even stronger than the previous Flame Race. However, this time, the Heavenly Dao was long prepared. The cultivators of the Heavenly Race, the Heavenly Dao Sect, and the netherworld entered the war. The news quickly spread to the Immortal World. The mighty figures ranked ahead of the Providence Board rushed to the netherworld’s nine springs. Not all the mighty figures in the Immortal World belonged to Sage Sects.
 Most of them had their own factions and ambitions. In the previous battle with the Flame Race, all the living beings who had participated and survived had obtained merit. This made the mighty figures concerned. It was not only to protect the Heavenly Dao but also to fight for merit. “After the Flame Race, another race attacked from the Chaos. It’s called the Calamity Race.
 The location of this battle is the netherworld. I hope that all cultivators will go and fight. Protect the Heavenly Dao and protect the order of reincarnation! “The Heavenly Dao is becoming stronger. An unprecedented huge change is happening. In the future, there will be more than nine Sages in the Heavenly Dao. There will even be existences that surpass the Sages. We, Heavenly Dao living beings, should be united. “This will not be the last calamity. It will also be the opportunity for the Heavenly Dao to rise!”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du’s voice resounded through the myriad worlds, causing an uproar. To Sages, this calamity came quickly. However, to all living beings, the calamity of the Flame Race was already a legend. It was extremely ancient. However, Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du’s words were filled with bewitchment, painting a magnificent scene of an epic era for all living beings. Han Jue sighed. Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du was indeed capable of fooling people.
 He didn’t mind it and continued cultivating. This thousand-year seclusion was only halfway done. He had to continue. If the sky collapsed, the Sages would hold it up. He had no need to worry.
 He didn’t want to be a nanny.
 Time passed quickly.
 Soon, a thousand years passed.
 Han Jue’s cultivation improved again. He opened his eyes and looked. The netherworld was already completely chaotic. Hundreds of years of battle had sacrificed countless cultivators.
 The Calamity Race was indeed powerful. Compared to the Flame Race, not only were they more powerful, but their mid-level combatants’ strength was also abundant. The Heavenly Dao had always been defeated, and the Yama Hall had already been occupied by the Calamity Race. The current netherworld could be said to be the back garden of the Calamity Race. Strangely, the Calamity Race did not further invade the mortal world and the Immortal World.
 The Sage Sects were still constantly sending disciples to attack the netherworld. During the calamity, countless geniuses also appeared. Han Jue saw that Empress Houtu, Su Qi, Yang Tiandong, and the other leaders of the netherworld were all imprisoned.
 This prison was located at the bottom of the Yellow Spring and was guarded by millions of living beings from the Calamity Race. There was even a Pseudo-Sage among them. It could be said to be extremely tight. Outside the netherworld, in front of the spatial hole, was a Calamity Race city. An extremely powerful aura could be sensed from inside. Divine Lord Peacock! It was obvious that the Calamity Race was different from the Flame Race. The Flame Race was completely a pawn and only knew how to charge. Why did the Calamity Race have their own plans?
 Han Jue couldn’t figure it out and couldn’t be bothered to use the derivation function to ask.
 He discovered that in just a few hundred years, dozens of Zenith Heaven Golden Immortals and a Pseudo-Sage had appeared in the Heavenly Dao. However, the cycle of reincarnation was controlled, causing the Heavenly Dao to be filled with wandering ghosts. Han Jue said, “Come in.” Outside the Daoist temple, Li Xuan’ao had been waiting for several years.
 He entered and knelt down to Han Jue. “Sect Master, the battle in the netherworld has been going on for hundreds of years. The Heavenly Dao is weak. Should the Hidden Sect make a move?” Li Xuan’ao asked.
 He felt that this was a good opportunity. Most of the disciples in the Hidden Sect had already reached their limits. They couldn’t improve by cultivating alone. The Heavenly Dao merit could allow them to advance to another level.
 Han Jue smiled. “Not yet.” The Calamity Race was different from the Flame Race. They were even stronger. Han Jue didn’t want the Hidden Sect to sacrifice themselves in vain.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du wasn’t in a hurry, so why would Han Jue be in a hurry?
 Li Xuan’ao could only offer his opinion. As long as Han Jue did not agree, he couldn’t force him. “Call Dao Sovereign over,” Han Jue instructed. Li Xuan’ao immediately left. Not long after, Dao Sovereign arrived. He knelt in front of him. Han Jue asked, “When will you become a Pseudo-Sage?”
 Dao Sovereign had already reached the perfected Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm, but he couldn’t become a Pseudo-Sage.
 Logically speaking, with his Chaotic Physique and Han Jue’s Great Dao of Extreme Origin, it shouldn’t be difficult for him to become a Pseudo-Sage. Dao Sovereign hesitated and then said, “Master, it might be related to my Dao heart. I understand myself. I love fame. I’ve been in seclusion in the Hidden Sect and always want to go out and adventure.”
 Han Jue didn’t reply. Dao Sovereign was uneasy. Han Jue silently deduced. So the reason why Li Xuan’ao came to propose was that Dao Sovereign begged him.
 How cunning!
 Han Jue was even more satisfied with Li Xuan’ao. Even if his suggestion was rejected, he didn’t sell Dao Sovereign to save his image.
 Han Jue said, “Dao Sovereign, do you know who I value the most?’”
 Dao Sovereign said carefully, “Guan Bubai?” Dao Sovereign felt the greatest pressure from this Junior Brother. He used to have the strongest potential, but the addition of Guan Bubai had lost him his title. This was also the reason why he urgently wanted to go out. “No, it’s you. It’s always been you!” Han Jue rejected firmly. Dao Sovereign trembled. Han Jue said, “Since you want to go out, I’ll support you. However, other than becoming a Pseudo-Sage, you have to make a name for yourself!” “I, Han Jue, either don’t fight or emerge at the top. If you fight, you have to be spectacular and dazzling like a bright sun. Dao Sovereign, I hope you can be as impressive as Li Daokong in the previous calamity!”
 Dao Sovereign’s blood boiled when he heard that, and he immediately promised. That day, Dao Sovereign left the Hundred Peak Immortal River and headed to the netherworld to participate in the battle. The reason why he released Dao Sovereign was first, to let him break through, and second, to give Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du an explanation, proving that the Hidden Sect wasn’t just watching the show.
 Han Jue’s gaze landed outside the netherworld. Divine Lord Peacock’s aura was indeed very strong, so powerful that he wasn’t confident in insta-killing him.
 In that case…
 He could only do what he could as a world savior! Han Jue took out the Book of Misfortune and started cursing Divine Lord Peacock. After a while, Han Jue opened his eyes and frowned. What happened? He couldn’t curse Divine Lord Peacock! Han Jue tried a few more times and the curse failed.
 Something was wrong! “I want to know why I can’t curse Divine Lord Peacock?” Han Jue used the derivation function. (200 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?] So expensive!
 Could the existence be stronger than Ancestor Xitian?

 A line of words appeared in front of Han Jue.
