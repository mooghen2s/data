 Dao attainment qualification!
 Han Tuo’s breathing quickened.
 Although attaining the Dao was extremely far from him, he knew that attaining the Dao was extremely difficult. How many geniuses had died at the Pseudo-Sage threshold, let alone attaining the Dao at a higher level?
 Han Tuo said, “Thank you, senior. I understand!”
 He immediately stood up and left. He finally woke up after leaving the Hundred Peak Immortal River. He laughed at himself.
 It was not giving him opportunities, but merely looking down on him.
 Fine, then! When have I, Han Tuo, ever relied on a sect to travel the world?
 Han Tuo’s eyes became firm again. Since the Hidden Sect did not want him, why should he be persistent?
 A million years?
 Heh!
 Han Tuo’s eyes became firm and he stopped thinking about this.
 Perhaps he was born to be free and unrestrained.
 Han Tuo left in despair.
 Han Jue could sense this kid’s depression and dissatisfaction. This was not bad.
 Son, I let you go because I have absolute confidence in protecting you.
 Han Jue sighed.
 After all, he had watched Han Tuo grow up. He hoped that he would become a person with absolute confidence and not someone who blindly trusted his father.
 He was still very satisfied with Han Tuo’s current experience. He was sensible, but he wasn’t afraid of powerful enemies!
 In the Chaotic Domain.
 Five figures gathered. They couldn’t see each other’s faces.
 Zhou Fan smiled proudly. “Recently, I’ve been doing well in Chaotic City. I’ve recruited many prodigies as my underlings.”
 Dao Sovereign snorted. “Don’t forget to cultivate.”
 “How can this be!”
 Zhou Fan turned to look at Yi Tian and said, “Little fellow, you’re very famous now. Your name spread all the way to the Chaotic City. Don’t follow the demons. If I introduce you to the Hidden Sect or the Chaotic City, you can obtain supreme cultivation resources.”
 Yi Tian said, “Tch, I don’t need any resources. Like I said before, my talent is number one in the world!”
 “That’s because you’re not standing in front of me. Otherwise, I’ll make you kneel down with one palm!”
 “Aren’t you cultivating tens of thousands of years more than me? I’ll definitely become a Sage in the future. You’re at most a Pseudo-Sage!”
 “Hehe, how can you become a Sage?”
 Zhou Fan and Yi Tian began to bicker.
 Zhao Xuanyuan looked at Han Tuo and asked, “Why didn’t you come to the Hidden Sect?”
 Han Tuo said, “The Sect Master of the Hidden Sect asked me to go back in a million years. He wants me to become a Pseudo-Sage first.”
 Dao Sovereign and the other two didn’t reveal Han Jue’s identity, including his name. After all, Han Jue didn’t reveal his identity when he was in the Chaotic Domain.
 Dao Sovereign shook his head and said, “Your surname is also Han. I thought that Master would be moved. What a pity.”
 Han Jue indeed had rules. Without reaching the Pseudo-Sage Realm, one was not allowed to go out. Now, this rule was extended to the outside world. It was normal.
 Han Tuo asked curiously, “The name of the Hidden Sect Master begins with Han?” Zhou Fan glared at Dao Sovereign and scolded him. “Don’t speak nonsense. How can you reveal the name of a Sage!”
 Dao Sovereign knew that he had said something wrong and couldn’t help but shake his head.
Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m Zhao Xuanyuan smiled. “Don’t ask. There are many people with the surname Han. We can’t let all the disciples with the surname Han acknowledge our master as their ancestor, right? We can’t build relationships randomly.”
 Han Tuo nodded.
 Yi Tian snorted. “So what if he’s a Sage? I’ll become a Sage sooner or later. Brothers, recently, someone pretended to have the Chaotic Physique but didn’t enter here. Should we go and deal with them together? They’re in the Heavenly Race!”
 Zhao Xuanyuan said angrily, “You’re really a loyal dog of the demons. You’re taking the opportunity to let us deal with the Heavenly Race? Don’t you know that the Hidden Sect is behind them?”
 Stunned, Yi Tian asked in surprise, “The Hidden Sect supports the Heavenly Race? Why didn’t I know?”
 Han Tuo said helplessly, “I already know. You fight all day and the subordinates around you fawn on you. How can you understand the real world?”
 Yi Tian did not say anything.
 If anyone said anything about him, he would retort. Only towards Han Tuo would he not refute.
 Apart from being good friends, Han Tuo had also saved his life.
 A thousand years passed in the blink of an eye. Han Jue discovered that ever since he subdued Heavenly Venerate Wufa, there had been no more trouble. To him, time passed very quickly.
 Han Jue’s cultivation level kept increasing, and he was getting closer and closer to the late-stage Primordial Chaos Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm. “How wonderful. How good would it be if it could continue like this?”
 Han Jue opened his eyes and thought happily. Peace had better last until he was invincible! Han Jue checked his emails. He didn’t know how his recent friends were doing.

 This Emperor Xiao...
 He actually pretended to be the Dark Forbidden Lord and cursed people everywhere!
 Aren’t you making me take the blame for you?
 Han Jue was unhappy.
 When the Sages mentioned the curse, they would definitely think of the Dark Forbidden Lord. Although no one guessed that he was the Dark Forbidden Lord, he was still unhappy.
 After all, the Dark Forbidden Lord was Han Jue’s alternate identity. Fortunately, this fellow had suffered retribution!
 Han Jue watched for a while. The commotion was endless, but it had nothing to do with him.
 Han Tuo had already begun to take risks, but with the calamity around, Han Jue was not worried about him.
 An hour later, Han Jue visited Qiu Xilai in his dreams and asked about the Reincarnation Mystic Realm.
 In the dream.
 Qiu Xilai replied, “I can’t find the Dark Sage King. This fellow is too cautious.”
 Han Jue asked, “Why can’t you destroy the Reincarnation Mystic Realm?”
 “No, this mystic realm was once the territory of the Heavenly Dao Race’s Dragon Race. The providence is still there. If it’s destroyed and the Heavenly Dao is incomplete, the forces outside the Heavenly Dao will surge in.” “I see. Then, you have to strictly guard this place. The Dark Sage King will attack sooner or later.”
 “Yes, I’ve asked Li Muyi. The Dark Sage King is indeed powerful. If not for the providence of the Heavenly Dao in the Chiliocosm World, he would have died in the Dark Sage King’s hands.”
 “I’ll cultivate well and fight him in the future. Before that, you can’t be negligent.” “Don’t worry.”
 Han Jue left the dream.
 For some reason, Qiu Xilai’s attitude made him feel very uneasy.
 Qiu Xilai was very respectful to him, but he was a little perfunctory.
 Recently, Qiu Xilai had been very well-behaved. It was unknown what he was doing
 Han Jue consumed 4 billion years of his lifespan. He was relieved after confirming that Qiu Xilai couldn’t kill him.
 “I want to know when the Dark Sage King will attack the Immortal World?”
 (50 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [In about five billion years]
 So long?
 That was settled!
 Han Jue wasn’t even a hundred million years old now.
 I’ll have reached the Great Dao Sage Realm after five billion years no matter what, right?
 “What I have to do now is not curse the Dark Sage King, lest this fellow gets desperate and forcefully attacks the Heavenly Dao ahead of time, just like those ambitious people who faced the previous calamity.”
 Han Jue secretly decided.
 He couldn’t use the Book of Misfortune casually in the future.
 Han Jue stopped thinking and looked outside the Daoist temple. A disciple had been kneeling for a long time.
 Long Hao!
 Ever since he returned to the Hidden Sect, Long Hao’s personality had changed. He had become more mature and did not speak as much as before.
 This was the first time he looked for Han Jue alone after returning.
