 How strong was that?
 Han Jue couldn’t even imagine. After reaching the Primordial Chaos Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm, he couldn’t even imagine what the origin of the Great Dao Sage was, let alone a higher existence.
 No matter what, if Heavenly Venerate Wufa’s backing was locked in the Ancient Desolate, Han Jue didn’t have to be afraid.
 His gaze landed on the Wufa Palace again.
 After the battle with Li Muyi ended, Heavenly Venerate Wufa continued to recruit disciples and prepared to preach the Dao. Han Jue deduced that his son was also in the Dao Field.
 Forget it.
 He would let Heavenly Venerate Wufa preach the Dao first and tidy up after.
 It was a good opportunity for the living beings of the Heavenly Dao to become stronger. They could be more at ease when facing the Heavenly Devil Tribulation in the future.
 About ten years passed.
 The Wufa Palace closed and the Heavenly Venerate began to preach.
 Han Jue silently calculated. More than ten billion living beings had entered the palace.
 Heavenly Venerate Wufa was indeed generous.
 After the lecture, he directly obtained ten billion disciples. Among these disciples, he could choose some with top potential.
 What a pity.
 “Heavenly Venerable Wufa, you won’t be able to laugh until the end.
 “How long you can live depends on how long you can preach.”
 Han Jue secretly mocked.
 Year after year passed.
 In the blink of an eye, a hundred years passed.
 Inside Wufa Palace.
 This place was like a world. The ground was like water and the sky was white. Countless living beings sat on the water surface. After a hundred years of preaching, most of the living beings had already transformed.
 Han Tuo and Jie Yu were the closest.
 Jie Yu opened his eyes and looked at him. He asked with a smile, “How’re your gains?”
 Han Tuo smiled. “Not bad. What about you?”
 It was not just ‘not bad’!
 Surprise!
 He actually easily understood the Great Dao that Heavenly Venerate Wufa taught. Other than the increase in his cultivation, many thoughts also appeared in his mind, making him very excited.
 Jie Yu smiled. “It’s alright, but I feel inferior to you. You always surprise me.”
 Han Tuo smiled and did not reply.
 Although the two of them had a good relationship, they had their own secrets and never interfered with each other. This was also the reason why they got along well.
 At this moment, Heavenly Venerate Wufa’s voice sounded.
 “The first lecture is over. From now on, all of you are disciples of the Wufa Sect. No matter what sect you came from, you must abandon it. I will lead you to prosperity. I am the strongest Sage!”
 His tone was extremely firm and confident.
 These words made most living beings worship him.
 Only a few disciples from other sects were very uncomfortable, but they did not dare to stand out and offend Heavenly Venerate Wufa.
 “The Heavenly Devil Calamity has just ended. All of you should be able to sense that the previous Sages are too weak, causing the Heavenly Devils to be rampant for so long. If I lead the Heavenly Dao, such a tragic scene will definitely not appear. Believe in me and follow me. This will be the greatest opportunity in your lives!
 “My ambitions are to unite the myriad worlds in the universe and control the Heavenly Dao alone. I will lead all living beings in the Heavenly Dao to surpass the Great Dao and the past. I will stand at the end of the River of Destiny and look down on everything.”
 The more Heavenly Venerate Wufa spoke, the more arrogant he became.
 Han Tuo frowned slightly.
 For some reason, he instinctively resisted Heavenly Venerate Wufa.
 “So what if he’s a Sage?”
 The thought shocked him.
 Logically speaking, after hearing the lecture, he should worship and revere Heavenly Venerate Wufa. However, seeing that the other party was so arrogant, he was inexplicably unhappy. Jie Yu’s voice floated over, “Don’t resist him. He’s testing us.”
 He used a voice transmission.
 Test?
 Han Tuo was shocked and hurriedly extinguished the flames of disdain in his heart.
 At the same time, he became wary of Jie Yu.
 This kid was not simple.
 He could even see through the methods of a Sage?
 Thinking about it carefully, he had never seen Jie Yu in a sorry state. No matter how strong the enemy was, he was always calm.
 Jie Yu sensed Han Tuo’s gaze and smiled. His eyes narrowed into two crescent moons.
 Heavenly Venerate Wufa was still speaking.
 At the same time.
 Han Jue had already arrived in front of Wufa Palace. He didn’t barge in immediately but stood in front of the door and waited. His Supreme Treasure had already been activated, and the divine light of the Sun and Moon Yin-Yang Protection covered his figure.
 “Han Jue, what do you want to do?”
 Qiu Xilai’s voice entered his ears.
 Not only Qiu Xilai, but the other Sages also asked with voice transmissions.
 Han Jue didn’t answer.
 The reason why he did not immediately attack was that he was afraid of injuring the listeners.
 The reason why he came was that he was worried that Heavenly Venerate Wufa would use some tricks on them.
 Heavenly Venerate Wufa sensed Han Jue’s appearance and ended his speech, asking the ten billion disciples to leave.
 Boom
 The door to the palace opened and a pillar of light rose.
 “The array formation outside the door can send you back. Cultivate well and wait for my next lecture.”
 Heavenly Venerate Wufa’s voice sounded. Han Jue could also hear it.
 Disciples walked out of the palace one after another. Seeing him, they were all stunned, but no one dared to approach.
 Han Jue’s aura was very strong, making them fearful.
 One disciple after another stepped into the pillar of light, forming a long dragon that connected the interior of the palace to the pillar of light.
 Heavenly Venerate Wufa did not come out directly. He was probably waiting for the listeners to leave.
 On the other side.
 The Sages gathered in Qiu Xilai’s palace.
 The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate asked excitedly, “Han Jue is going to fight with Heavenly Venerate Wufa?”
 Sect Master Tian Jue sighed. “Probably. He won’t take the initiative to visit for no reason. Once he appears, he will definitely attack.”
 Emperor Xiao smiled. “Han Jue’s actions impressed me. This is a true cultivator. Unlike Li Muyi, who only knows how to curse behind his back!”
 Fuxitian also came, but Li Muyi did not.
 Li Muyi was rejected by them. Even the South Extreme Heavenly Venerate and Sect Master Tian Jue did not interact with him.
 “I even suspected that Han Jue is the Dark Forbidden Lord. I’m really ashamed.” Sect Master Tian Jue sighed.
 How were Han Jue’s actions like the Dark Forbidden Lord?
 They began to look forward to what would happen next.
 Every disciple who left the Wufa Palace would glance at Han Jue and not dare to look anymore.
 They thought that Han Jue was a mighty figure under Heavenly Venerate Wufa.
 Han Tuo and Jie Yu chatted as they walked out of the palace.
 At this moment, Han Tuo suddenly saw Han Jue.
 This glance stunned him.
 For some reason, Han Jue’s figure made him absent-minded, and he felt inexplicably close.
 “Who is he?”
 Han Tuo frowned and stared at Han Jue.
 Jie Yu said, “Don’t look.”
 Han Tuo jolted awake and hurriedly retracted his gaze.
 After that, Han Tuo didn’t dare to look at Han Jue anymore, afraid that he would anger this mysterious mighty figure.
Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m However, in his heart, Han Jue’s figure couldn’t be erased, making him curious.
 Who was this person?
 Han Jue noticed that Han Tuo’s cultivation had increased quite well. Not only that, but his physical bloodline actually contained a trace of Dao runes.
 Good kid!
 As expected of my son!
 Han Jue thought silently. Most of his attention was still on Heavenly Venerate Wufa, in case he left.
 Han Tuo stepped into the pillar of light with the group. The moment he entered, he couldn’t help but turn around.
 Shining with divine light, Han Jue quietly stood at the side of the Wufa Palace’s doors. He didn’t move at all, like a god who would always stand in the river of time. He emitted a vast aura and loneliness.
