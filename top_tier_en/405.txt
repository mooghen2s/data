 (Defended successfully]
 Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief when he saw the two lines of words.
 Although he didn’t know if the other party had good intentions or ill intentions, it was better to resist just in case. Han Jue was quite satisfied with his current situation and did not want to change it.
 “Who’s affecting my fate?” Han Jue asked in his heart. If it was an enemy, he would be dead!
 [2 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 A figure appeared in Han Jue’s mind.
 It was Fang Liang!
 Han Jue frowned. He could only see Fang Liang’s appearance and didn’t know what he had done.
 The system couldn’t detect if Fang Liang had good intentions. Could it be that he was plotting in the Primordial Era?
 Han Jue remembered that his soul had passed through the primordial era and had yet to return.
 Very likely. Han Jue asked in another way, “Is Fang Liang harming me?”
 [A billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [Not for the time being.)
 Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief. That was good.
 Then, he stopped thinking and continued to comprehend the Dao.
 More than a year later.
 Three lines of words appeared in front of Han Jue.
 [Detected that you have reached 6,000 years old and your life has taken another step forward. You have the following choices:]
 (1: Immediately enter the calamity and fight for providence and fame. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment and a Heavenly Dao Spirit Stone.)
 [2: Avoid the calamity for the time being and cultivate in a low profile manner. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment and a Mystical Power inheritance.)
 Han Jue didn’t make a choice immediately this time.
 He asked silently, “I’m not in the calamity
 yet?”
 (You are, but you don’t fight for providence and fame. You need to let everyone know your true existence.)
 There was no need to consider!
 Han Jue chose option 2.
 [You chose to temporarily avoid the calamity and obtained a Great Dao Fragment and a Mystical Power inheritance.)
 [Congratulations on obtaining the Great Dao Mystical Power-Grand Unity Aspect]
 [Grand Unity Aspect: A Mystical Power formed by the Great Dao. It can condense the Dharma idols of the three thousand Chaotic Fiendcelestials.]
 Great Dao Mystical Power!
 Stunned, Han Jue hurriedly inherited this Mystical Power.
 An unprecedented memory surged into his mind.
Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m The Dharma idols of the three thousand Chaotic Fiendcelestials were not their bodies, but their Dao. The appearance of the Dharma idols could only be known after Han Jue successfully cultivated them.
 Several days later, Han Jue finally digested this huge memory. The first Chaotic Fiendcelestial Dharma idol he cultivated was extremely ferocious. He cultivated step by step according to the Mystical Power inheritance.
 However, the Great Dao Mystical Power was a Great Dao Mystical Power. Han Jue had cultivated for a month but still hadn’t condensed his first Chaotic Fiendcelestial Dharma idol.
 How long would it take to condense all three thousand Chaotic Fiendcelestial Dharma idols?
 Han Jue had no choice but to give up and continue cultivating.
 He had to reach the Zenith Heaven Realm first!
 cars
 In the blink of an eye, another ten years passed.
 Han Jue took out the Book of Misfortune and started cursing Jade Emperor Zhou Yan.
 Although the Book of Misfortune was already a Zenith Heaven Numinous Treasure, if he wanted to affect Jade Emperor Zhou Yan, he had to wait for his cultivation level to increase to the Zenith Heaven Realm.
 Han Jue cursed as he checked his emails regularly.
 [Your good friend Li Daokong has fused with a mysterious Dao Literature. His cultivation has increased greatly.]
 (Your good friend Li Daokong has comprehended a Heavenly Dao Mystical Power. He has shocked the world.]
 (Your good friend Ji Xianshen was attacked by an Immortal Emperor.)
 (Your good friend Zhou Fan was attacked by your enemy Jade Emperor Zhou Yan. He was severely injured.)
 (Your good friend Li Daokong was attacked by your enemy Jade Emperor Zhou Yan.)
 (Your good friend Li Daokong was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure) x6 (Your good friend Tai Sutian has been enlightened by the Heavenly Dao and has stepped into the Emperor Realm.] (Your good friend Han Ming obtained a mysterious mighty figure’s inheritance.]
 Li Daokong was so crazy!
 Han Jue could imagine the dangerous scene of Li Daokong fighting with Jade Emperor Zhou Yan just by reading the emails.
 Looking at the emails, only Li Daokong dared to keep fighting Jade Emperor Zhou Yan.
 After Di Lantian was killed by Jade Emperor Zhou Yan, there was no more news.
 As expected of the eldest disciple of the Human School!
 “Brother Li, don’t panic. With my help, you won’t be alone,” Han Jue thought silently and started to increase the curse power.
 He noticed that Han Ming had obtained the inheritance of a mysterious mighty figure. He didn’t plan to do anything. This kid had already reincarnated. What did it have to do with him?
 The enemy could forget about using Han Ming to threaten him!
 Five days later.
 Han Jue began to consume his lifespan.
 Ten billion years!
 Twenty billion years!
 Thirty billion years!
 Forty billion years!
 Han Jue stopped cursing as he felt dizzy. He bled from his seven orifices and was extremely pale. However, his external injuries were superficial and he could recover quickly.
 “I wonder how that fellow is now.”
 Han Jue secretly looked forward to it. Then, he put away the Book of Misfortune and released the Strange Deity from the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus.
 The Strange Deity floated in the air and wandered around as if expressing its dissatisfaction.
 After being with Han Jue, its intelligence had been growing
 Although they couldn’t communicate yet, Han Jue could already feel its emotions.
 “Go away, don’t disturb me!”
 Han Jue waved his hand. After pushing the Strange Deity away with his Dharmic powers, he continued to comprehend the Great Dao of Life and Death.
 The Strange Deity stared at him and stopped flying. It seemed to be in deep thought.
 In the Dark Universe, above the sea of clouds, under an old tree.
 Jade Emperor Zhou Yan was circulating his energy when his expression suddenly changed. He clearly did not feel good. “Damn it, when will he stop!”
 Jade Emperor Zhou Yan was furious.
 He had fought Li Daokong not long ago. The Dark Forbidden Lord had suddenly cursed him, almost causing him to lose.
 On average, every five years, the Dark Forbidden Lord would curse him once, and each time, he would become more ferocious.
 Although Jade Emperor Zhou Yan was not afraid of curses, it was really annoying if this continued.
 He had thought of contacting the Dark Forbidden Lord, but there was no way. Even the Heavenly Emperor couldn’t take the initiative to contact him.
 At this moment…
 A figure appeared in front of him. His body shone with divine light. He was burly, but he did not reveal his true appearance.
 “Jade Emperor, you’re too impudent. You’ve already displeased some Sages,” the divine light figure said bluntly.
 Jade Emperor Zhou Yan didn’t even open his eyes as he said, “Great Nine Heavens, are you here to stop me?”
 The divine figure called the Great Nine Heavens snorted. “If the Sect Master supports you, I will naturally support you. However, I hope that you won’t cause more trouble for the Sect Master. Sages are unfathomable, and their emotions are even more so.”
 Jade Emperor Zhou Yan opened his eyes and asked, “I want to know, which Sage is supporting the Human Race?”
 Great Nine Heavens shook his head and said, “We’re not qualified to know. Be careful in the future. Before fighting for providence, don’t go against the Heavenly Dao’s will.”
 With that, Great Nine Heavens vanished.
 Jade Emperor Zhou Yan frowned and snorted in his heart. “When this calamity ends, I will be the Heavenly Dao’s will!”
 (Jade Emperor Zhou Yan’s hatred towards you increased. Current Hatred Points: 5 stars]
 Han Jue, who was cultivating, didn’t care when he saw this notification.
 They were already irreconcilable!
 It had been four years since the last curse. In another year, he could mess with Jade Emperor Zhou Yan again.
 As Han Jue was thinking, he suddenly felt something on his back.
 It was the Strange Deity.
 Han Jue was shocked to find that the Strange Deity was touching his Dharmic powers.
 What was he doing?
