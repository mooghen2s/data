 (You need to reach the Heavenly Dao Immortal World before you can choose this option.]
 Han Jue could only give up.
 Although he could sense the existence of the Six Paths Insignia, Hidden Sect Island had moved in the Dark Forbidden Zone many times. It was too far from the Immortal World and could not reach it anytime soon.
 Thinking of the Six Paths Insignia, Han Jue couldn’t help but think of Immortal Emperor Samsara. This fellow had not moved for a long time. From his interpersonal relationships, he could see that he was still alive.
 It was worth mentioning that Immortal Emperor Samsara was at the mid-stage of the Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm.
 To be able to hide beside the Heavenly Emperor and not be discovered, he was naturally not inferior to the Heavenly Emperor’s cultivation. However, he was no longer anything impressive in Han Jue’s eyes.
 Ever since he started cursing Sage Fated Secrets, Han Jue no longer cared about the Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm.
 Thinking back, Han Jue shook his head and laughed.
 Not long ago, he had also treated Immortal Emperor Samsara as a powerful enemy. Unfortunately, as time passed, Immortal Emperor Samsara had already left the competition stage in Han Jue’s eyes.
 This was potential!
 Han Jue didn’t need to fight. As long as he hid somewhere and cultivated in peace, the enemy would probably be surpassed by him before they could even react.
 “I have to attain the Dao before the next Immeasurable Calamity comes!”
 Han Jue set a goal for himself.
 The Immeasurable Calamity had begun. With the heavenly secrets concealed, Sages could descend into the mortal world. At that time, the Heavenly Dao Immortal World would become dangerous!
 According to the past, it was still very far from the next Immeasurable Calamity. After all, the Divine Palace had risen during the end of the Immeasurable Calamity. If it became famous again, its development time would definitely not be short.
 Seven years later.
 Hidden Sect Island finally entered the Immortal World. Han Jue controlled the island to continue forward and used his divine sense to observe everything along the way.
 The ground was desolate, no greenery could be seen. Many blood lakes had yet to dry. The sky was dark and there was no sun. Everything looked so silent and desolate.
 Han Jue sighed. For several days, he didn’t see a single living being.
 One had to know that the speed of flying on Hidden Sect Island was not slow. In his previous life, in a few days, one could circle around the galaxy.
 This was the first time Han Jue truly felt how big the Immortal World was. It far exceeded his imagination. It was endless.
 Such a vast land endured fighting for thousands of years until all living beings were dead. It was truly terrifying.
 Hidden Sect Island continued forward. Han Jue had to choose a clean place to land.
 As for the Spirit Qi, he didn’t think too much about it. No place in the entire Immortal World had more Spirit Qi than his Dao Field.
 After a year, Han Jue finally found a clean mountain range that stretched for a million miles. The forest undulated and was full of life, but there were no traces of living beings.
 Hidden Sect Island landed in a forest. It was like a small stone landing on a pile of leaves, inconspicuous.
 Han Jue walked out of the Connate Cave Abode and waved his right hand, moving everyone out of the Dao Field. Then, he followed.
 The Nether Race and Hidden Sect disciples landed in the forest, stunned.
 “This is the Immortal World. From now on, we will stay here. All of you are not allowed to leave a radius of a million miles. Establish a residence nearby and build the Hidden Sect.”
 Han Jue spoke, his voice entering everyone’s ears.
 Everyone became excited. They had finally returned to the Immortal World.
 The disciples who had never been to the Immortal World were a little nervous.
 Han Jue returned to Hidden Sect Island.
 (You choose to return to the Heavenly Dao Immortal World and obtain a Great Dao Fragment and a chance to activate a new function of the system.]
 (System has activated the Absolute Purification Function.]
 [Absolute Purification: It can purify Dharma treasures, living beings, natural treasures, and other negative elements, including restrictions and curses. The price is lifespan deduction.]
 Eh?
 Purification?
 Han Jue was disappointed. That’s it?
 He thought about it and asked in his mind, “Are you sure it’s any negative factor? If the Great Dao Sages curse me or cast a forbidden spell on me, can I also purify it?”
 (Yes, as long as you are willing to spend enough lifespan.)
 That was good.
 Han Jue had no lack of lifespan to spend.
 “Let me try it myself first.” Han Jue thought silently.
 (2 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 It was about the same price as the derivation function. Han Jue could still accept it.
 If purification took trillions of years or even more, what would happen?
 A strange heat flowed in Han Jue’s body. It was warm and comfortable and a little itchy.
 Ten minutes later.
 (Purification has ended. Perfect state.]
 Han Jue smiled and stopped studying this function.
CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m He had already gathered nine Great Dao Fragments. Next, he began to fuse them!
 He took out the nine Great Dao fragments and began to fuse them. This time, his goal was to create a Great Dao that belonged to him!
 An hour later.
 The nine Great Dao Fragments fused and Han Jue entered the Great Dao comprehension.
 Endless inspiration and ideas burst forth in his mind. He had always kept one thought.
 New Great Dao!
 In the continuous mountains and rivers, the Hidden Sect disciples and ten thousand Nether Race members were wandering in groups.
 Among them, Zhao Xuanyuan, Dao Sovereign, and Jiang Yi walked together aimlessly.
 The three of them were previously the number one prodigies of their major factions. They had common topics to talk about, so they were close.
 “The negative karma of the world has dissipated. The calamity has truly ended.” Dao Sovereign sighed.
 He was the last to join the Hidden Sect. When he left, the negative karma of the world was so dense that it was visible to the naked eye. It was like the Yellow Spring’s purgatory.
 Zhao Xuanyuan smiled and said, “Fortunately, we joined the Hidden Sect. Otherwise, how could we obtain the providence of the Immeasurable Emperor?”
 Jiang Yi looked around and interrupted them. “This area doesn’t seem simple. I feel like I’ve been here before.”
 Zhao Xuanyuan and Dao Sovereign also started to observe carefully when they heard this.
 After a while.
 Dao Sovereign suddenly said in surprise, “This seems to be the old location of the Qilin Race. No wonder the mountains and rivers in this area aren’t affected. It’s the Qilin’s auspicious Qi that’s resisting the negative karma of the world.”
 Jiang Yi asked curiously, “Why isn’t there a Qilin here?”
 Zhao Xuanyuan added, “Could they all be dead?”
 Dao Sovereign and Jiang Yi’s eyelids twitched. Their cultivation levels were not weak. Their divine sense covered more than a million kilometers. Other than the Hidden Sect, they did not capture any traces of a living being.
 They suddenly thought of a terrifying possibility.
 Were all the living beings in the Immortal World dead?
 They looked at each other and flew up to observe their surroundings.
 Han Jue wouldn’t allow them to leave a radius of a million miles, but they could use their clone Mystical Powers to investigate.
 A year later.
 The three of them came to a conclusion.
 All living beings of the Heavenly Dao were really gone!
 Not to mention a radius of a million miles, even when their clones traveled through several regions, they did not see a single living being
 They told the others of the Hidden Sect about this, shocking them.
 After sighing, they began to rejoice in following Han Jue.
 If they didn’t cultivate diligently with Han Jue, they would have probably died in the calamity.
