 Chu Shiren sensed everyone’s gaze and said helplessly, “However, I’m already reincarnated. I can’t completely use my previous life’s cultivation. I have to cultivate from the start again. Otherwise, if I use my previous life’s cultivation too many times, my soul won’t be able to withstand it.”
 I see.
 Everyone was enlightened and felt better.
 If he didn’t have to pay the price for reincarnation, that would be too ridiculous!
 After knowing that Chu Shiren had the cultivation of his previous life, the attitude of the people from the Hidden Sect towards him became even more subtle.
 Han Jue also had some fear towards Chu Shiren, but his favorability towards him had reached 5.5 stars, so he would not betray him.
 Even if Chu Shiren attacked him, it was impossible for him to break through the defense of the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus.
 With the addition of the Divine Palace, the Nine Nether Purgatory was no longer as silent as before.
 The Divine Palace and the Jie School often had conflicts. The sound of battle would occasionally reach the Hidden Sect Island. Han Jue didn’t care about all of this and cultivated in peace.
 Next, he had to break through to the Four Mystic Divine Origin with all his might!
 After reaching the Four Mystic Divine Origin, he wouldn’t be far from the Six Mystic Divine Origin. He would only be a step away from Zenith Heaven!
 Han Jue liked to motivate himself and fill himself with fighting spirit.
 Time flew.
 Another thirty years passed.
 Han Jue’s cultivation improved greatly, but something that gave him a headache also happened. After the Divine Palace, another force came to the Nine Nether Purgatory. Han Jue spent ten million years asking who it was and learned that it was an ancient race, the Vermilion Bird Race!
nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎 Han Jue still missed the Vermilion Bird.
 He still remembered the pressure when he was frightened by a Vermilion Bird and did not dare to ascend. However, that Vermilion Bird had already perished, and it had even died in the hands of its own clansmen. This grudge could be considered settled.
 Han Jue was most worried about whether the Nine Nether Purgatory would become the next battlefield.
 When the forces of the Nine Nether Purgatory increased, conflict would naturally erupt.
 Because the Immortal World was filled with negative karma due to the tribulation, it was no different from the Nine Nether Purgatory in the future. Under such circumstances, hiding in the Nine Nether Purgatory was absolutely the best choice for many forces.
 “Looks like I have to find another location.”
 Han Jue thought silently.
 He couldn’t go personally. He had to send Liu Bei to find it.
 Han Jue called Liu Bei into the cave abode and explained his intention.
 Liu Bei frowned. Although he hesitated, he still agreed.
 He wasn’t against Han Jue’s orders. He just inherited Han Jue’s personality and was afraid of danger.
 Because of that, Han Jue believed that he could find the best hiding place. Han Jue taught Liu Bei the Invocation Technique. If he was in danger, he would save him.
 After learning the Invocation Technique, Liu Bei was relieved and left that day.
 Han Jue started cursing the enemy and checked his emails.
 Recently, Xing Hongxuan and Xuan Qingjun had been taught by a mighty figure. This made Han Jue feel that something was wrong.
 He thought for a moment and decided to give them a dream, as long as it was not the image of the Dark Forbidden Lord.
 Not only did his image have to change, but so did the scene.
 A month later, Han Jue first visited Xing Hongxuan in his dreams.
 The two of them met in the dream. Xing Hongxuan was pleasantly surprised when she saw Han Jue.
 However, she still asked warily, “Husband, I have a fortuitous encounter for you. Do you want to try it?”
 Han Jue was speechless.
 He snapped. “No!”
 Xing Hongxuan immediately beamed and rushed up to hug Han Jue.
 In Han Jue’s dream, Xing Hongxuan could clearly feel his body temperature as if it was reality.
 “Are you coming back? I’m afraid that you’ll die in the calamity,” Han Jue said directly.
 Xing Hongxuan was stunned. “I don’t think so? I’ve obtained the providence of the Human Emperor now, so I can avoid the calamity.” “How did you obtain it?”
 “The humans have gathered. The various Sacred Dynasties have chosen a prodigy to inherit the inheritance of the past Human Emperors. I was one of them. The humans are the protagonists of the Heavenly Dao. No matter how the calamity evolves, humans will not die. Husband, don’t worry. I won’t die. I will also try my best to avoid the calamity.”
 Xing Hongxuan spoke very seriously, implying that she did not want to go back.
 Han Jue could also understand. Not everyone could cultivate as diligently as him. Opportunities were also important.
 “Then, you have to be careful. Even if I appear in the future and ask you to die, you can’t trust it easily. No matter what, I won’t take the initiative to ask you to die,” Han Jue said seriously.
 Xing Hongxuan understood. “Could it be that someone wants to scheme against you?” “Who can guarantee that there won’t be?”
 Han Jue pretended to be casual.
 Since Xing Hongxuan was unwilling to leave, so be it.
 However, she hugged Han Jue tightly. Xing Hongxuan smirked. “Only you and I can sense this dream, right?” Han Jue felt that something was wrong. What did this girl want?
 Xing Hongxuan pressed him to the ground and got to work.
 Han Jue’s consciousness returned to reality. This dream lasted for a long time, but only half a day passed in reality. Before leaving, Han Jue told Xing Hongxuan that if she met him next time, she should use the Invocation Technique first to avoid being deceived by the enemy. It was not cautious enough to just ask.
 Xing Hongxuan agreed after hearing this. At the same time, she also realized how powerful the Invocation Technique was.
 She could actually summon her husband!
 If she had known earlier… Xing Hongxuan was filled with regret. If she had known earlier, she could have used it a few times.
 Next, Han Jue visited Xuan Qingjun’s dream. She also rejected him and said that she would be careful.
 The two of them chatted in the dream for a long time. Xuan Qingjun bragged about the Darkness Sect and the Dark Forbidden Lord. She said that after the calamity ended, she would pave the way for him and invite him to join the sect.
 Han Jue could only reply verbally and was speechless.
 Did I cuckold myself?
 Cough!
 Xuan Qingjun only admired the Dark Forbidden Lord. She had not changed her mind. Unlike Xing Hongxuan, Xuan Qingjun didn’t do anything intimate with him. After ending the dream, Han Jue continued cultivating.
 In the eyes of many living beings, the calamity was like the end of the world, but in the eyes of even more living beings, it was a fortuitous encounter.
 This was especially true for those with mediocre potential.
 Although Han Jue felt regretful about Xing Hongxuan and Xuan Qingjun’s decision, he was not angry.
 Everyone had their own goals. This was also good.
 Although it was safe to stay under Han Jue, they would be left further and further behind.
 Han Jue wanted to cultivate until his breakthrough, but there were always people disturbing him.
 Four years later, a Deity Realm existence of the Vermilion Bird Race discovered Hidden Sect Island.
 He transformed into a human and his body burned with flames. He was like a fire god as he stared at Hidden Sect Island. “Why is there a stone in the Nine Nether Purgatory? My divine sense can’t see through it. Could there be a restriction inside? Is there a different world?”
 The Deity Realm Vermilion Bird thought silently. He raised his right hand and waved the flames.
 The flames landed on Hidden Sect Island and were dispersed by the array formation.
 He didn’t believe it and prepared to continue attacking.
 Everyone on Hidden Sect Island could see the flames falling from the sky. As the array formation blocked them, they bloomed like fireworks. It was quite beautiful.
 “Is this fellow courting death?” The Black Hell Chicken cursed.
 For some reason, it felt like it had seen the aura outside somewhere before.
