 Immortal World, 13th Heaven.
Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com Palace after palace stood above a sea of clouds. Rows of immortal birds circled around them, and they were beautiful like paintings.
 Murong Qi, Dao Sovereign, and Jiang Yi flew over with two hundred Nether Race beings. As they advanced, they looked around.
 “This is the Heavenly Race?”
 “It feels even more imposing than the past Heavenly Court.”
 “It’s said that the Heavenly Race’s Patriarch has a close relationship with our Sect Master?”
 “Ji Xianshen once joined forces with Grandmaster to fight against an Immortal God.”
 “Are they really working together?”
 Murong Qi and the other two chatted softly. Their gazes did not stop sweeping in all directions.
 The aura of two hundred Immortal Emperors gathered together was extremely strong, attracting the attention of the living beings in front of the palaces along the way.
 Fang Huangjun flew over and stopped in front of Murong Qi. “You are…” Murong Qi said, “Hidden Sect disciple, Murong Qi.”
 Fang Huangjun raised his eyebrows and looked at Dao Sovereign and Jiang Yi.
 He was slightly moved.
 Dao Sovereign asked, “Where’s Fang Liang? Why isn’t he meeting us?”.
 Murong Qi nodded.
 The people of the Hidden Sect continued forward. Their appearance caused an undercurrent to stir in the 13th Heaven.
 Ever since Su Qi used the Dao Destruction Mystical Power, not to mention Immortal Emperors, there were not many Deity Realm existences left. Even the Immortal Emperors of the Three Schools of the Dao Sect were very few.
 The Heavenly Race had the most Immortal Emperors as it was not affected by the Dao Destruction Mystical Power.
 One of the palaces was the Jie School’s temporary residence.
 In the hall, Jing Tiangong and Huang Zuntian were discussing the territory they wanted to fight for.
 an
 Although the Immortal World was big, as an orthodox sect of the Dao Sect, the territory that the Jie School obtained could not be smaller than other factions. This was a matter of face. In the long run, it would subtly affect the Jie School’s status in the hearts of all living beings.
 A disciple suddenly rushed in.
 “Sect Master, vice sect master, the 13th Heaven welcomed a mysterious force. They actually have 200 Immortal Emperors!”
 The disciple knelt on the ground and said in a low voice.
 Two hundred Immortal Emperors!
 Jing Tiangong and Huang Zuntian were surprised.
 Jing Tiangong asked, “What faction?”
 The disciple said, “It seems to be called the Hidden Sect.”
 Hidden Sect!
 Huang Zuntian’s eyelids twitched.
 Jing Tiangong narrowed his eyes and said, “The Hidden Sect… Why haven’t I heard of it? Wait, it seems that Heavenly Emperor Fang is from the Hidden Sect. Is the Hidden Sect a mortal force?”
 The disciple said, “The leader of the Hidden Sect is the former prodigy of the Divine Palace, Profound Truth Divine Emperor. Alongside him is the number one prodigy of the Divine Palace, Dao Sovereign, and the number one prodigy of the Golden Crow Divine Clan, Jiang Yi.”
 This time, Jing Tiangong couldn’t remain calm.
 He had to pay attention to such a powerful force!
 Every time the calamity ended, a huge force would appear.
 Just like in the previous Divine Palace, Zu Tu had absorbed the losers of the various factions and gathered the momentum of the Divine Palace, splitting it into four parts of the Heavenly Dao.
 “Looks like I have to go personally,” Jing Tiangong muttered.
 Such a scene occurred in the palaces where the various factions lived.
 After the calamity ended, they could still produce 200 Immortal Emperors. Such a force was definitely terrifying. He had to try his best to rope them in. At the very least, he had to form goodwill and prevent them from becoming enemies in the future.
 Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 Han Jue calculated the time. The Heavenly Race Banquet should have already begun.
 He took out the Heavenly Dao Token and communicated with Fang Liang, hoping that he could take care of the Hidden Sect.
 Fang Liang promised that nothing would happen to the Hidden Sect. He said that he had already discussed with Ji Xianshen and would definitely not mistreat the Hidden Sect.
 Han Jue trusted the two of them.
 In the previous calamity, the two of them had never harmed a Hidden Sect disciple.
 On this day.
 Han Jue walked out of the Daoist temple and found Zhou Mingyue.
 Chu Shiren, Zhou Mingyue, Lu Huaxu, and Han Zuitian were meditating beside a small river.
 Chu Shiren was promoting the Buddhist Dharma. Zhou Mingyue was very impatient, but he could only endure.
 Seeing Han Jue appear, Zhou Mingyue was the first to stand up. He said in surprise, “Grandmaster!”
 The other three stood up and bowed.
 Han Jue still wore the Sun and Moon Yin-Yang Protection. The divine light shone, making it impossible to see his true appearance.
 Han Zuitian was very nervous. Every time he faced Han Jue, he would feel inexplicably afraid. However, he usually worshiped Han Jue the most. This feeling was extremely contradictory.
 Lu Huaxu, the reincarnated Purple Star Emperor, was secretly looking forward to it. Could it be that Han Jue was going to give them special treatment?
 Chu Shiren was the first to ask, “Grandmaster, what is it?”
 His eyes burned.
 After Dao Sovereign, Zhao Xuanyuan, Zhou Fan, Jiang Yi, and Li Yao, he felt that his talent was not inferior to anyone. He even wanted to catch up.
 Han Jue said, “I’ve been sitting for too long and want to come out for a walk. Come with
 me.”
 The four of them hurriedly nodded in agreement.
 The five of them began to wander in the forest. Han Jue began to talk about the past. He told them about his childhood in the outer sect of the Jade Pure Sacred Sect, except the part about the system.
 He talked about the trivial matters of planting flowers and grass. Chu Shiren and the others listened very seriously.
 Han Jue wasn’t a talkative person. There must be a deeper meaning to his words.
 As he spoke, Han Jue also fell into his memories.
 Mortals had become immortals, the world had even entered a new era.
 Nothing could surpass this sense of vicissitude.
 After Han Jue finished speaking, he stopped talking and immersed himself in the past as he walked.
 The five of them pondered.
 What did this story mean?
 If they couldn’t even comprehend this story, how could they have the face to ask Han Jue to give them special treatment?
 At the end, when Han Jue parted with them, he didn’t say anything deeper. The five of them started to speak in private,
 Ten years later.
 Han Jue thought that the banquet had ended and couldn’t help but check his emails.
 (Your good friend Ji Xianshen was attacked by a Pseudo-Sage. His body was destroyed. Fortunately, the Supreme Treasure protected him.]
 (Your disciple Dao Sovereign was attacked by your good friend Jiang Dugu and was severely injured.)
 (Your grand-disciple Fang Liang was attacked by your good friend Jiang Dugu and was severely injured.)
 [Your good friend Jing Tiangong was attacked by your good friend Jiang Dugu and was severely injured.)
 (Your good friend Huang Zuntian was attacked by your good friend Jiang Dugu and was severely injured.)
 [Your good friend Jiang Dugu was attacked by a mysterious Pseudo-Sage.]
 Han Jue frowned. What happened? Jiang Dugu attacked the Heavenly Race’s banquet?
 Didn’t Jiang Dugu already join the Heavenly Race?
 Han Jue immediately asked, “Why did Jiang Dugu attack the Heavenly Race’s banquet?”
 (2 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 Han Jue’s consciousness fell into the illusion.
 He came to a palace. From the vastness of the space, it was probably a Sage Dao Field.
 Jiang Dugu knelt in front of a figure.
 The figure of light said, “The Heavenly Ancestor of the Heavenly Race is too arrogant. He thinks that by obtaining the protection of the Heavenly Dao, he can do whatever he wants. The Human School should also rise. From today onwards, you are the Sect Master of the Human School. You will vigorously develop the Human School and spread your Dao techniques. Before the next calamity, the Human School needs to become one of the top factions in the world.
 “At this banquet, go teach Ji Xianshen a lesson.”
 Jiang Dugu frowned and asked, “Is the Human School going to enter the next calamity?”
 The last calamity had just ended. Even now, he was terrified when he recalled it. He didn’t want to enter the calamity again.
 The figure replied, “If you do well, you can become a Sage before the calamity. Nüwa has died and her position is already controlled by the Human School. It all depends on your performance.”
