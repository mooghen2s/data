 However, when he thought of how the Buddhist Sect had been destroyed, he felt that Qiu Xilai was not looking for him to serve the Buddhist Sect. It was probably related to Su Qi.
 His favorability had not decreased. It was acceptable.
 If he ignored him, would this fellow get angry and take revenge on Su Qi?
 Han Jue took a deep breath and adjusted his state of mind. He accepted the dream.
 It was still that glorious hall. Qiu Xilai maintained the attitude of a golden Buddha, high up and looking down on everything.
 Han Jue asked, “Senior, why are you looking for me?”
 Qiu Xi said, “Do you want to be Buddha?”
 Han Jue was confused.
 F*ck off!
 The Buddhist Sect is already gone, and you want me to become a Buddha?
 Qiu Xilai continued, “The Buddhist Sect in the Immortal World has already been disbanded. The providence has dissipated. After the calamity ends, I will personally appoint three Buddhas to rebuild the Buddhist Sect. It can be considered avoiding the calamity.”
 He was clearly being plotted against, but it sounded like his plan…
 Pretending to be shocked, Han Jue asked, “Why did the Buddhist Sect disband?”
 “It’s just to disperse the providence. The Buddhas are still around. This can reduce the losses of the calamity.”
 “Who are you…”
 “Sage of the Buddhist Sect, Qiu Xilai.”
 “Sage!”
 Han Jue pretended to be terrified.
 Qiu Xilai snorted. “Stop pretending. You already guessed that I’m a Sage, right!”
 Han Jue smiled helplessly. “The identity of the Buddha is too important. I’m afraid I can’t bear it. I just want to cultivate well and not manage the Buddhist Sect.”
 “It’s fine if you’re unwilling. I can let the Supreme Buddha control the Buddhist Sect.” Hearing this, Han Jue understood that Qiu Xilai was determined to be tied to him.
 Han Jue asked, “What’s the situation in the Immortal World now? When will the calamity end?”
 “In the game of the Sages, all living beings seek to survive. When a Sage dies, the calamity will be dissolved.”
 Qiu Xilai’s tone was extremely indifferent as if he did not care about the death of a Sage.
 Han Jue showed a frown.
 The battle between Sages had already reached such a level?
 Which Sage would perish?
 Han Jue’s intuition told him that it was very likely Fuxitian.
 Nüwa was the only one helping Fuxitian. The other Sages were on the same side.
 “Return to the Immortal World after the calamity ends. The order of the Heavenly Dao has been restored. Sages cannot directly attack the living beings of the Immortal World, or they will suffer a backlash from the Heavenly Dao,” Qiu Xilai continued.
 Han Jue nodded.
 He had the same intention. “The Heavenly Dao has the Immeasurable Calamity, but now, there’s more than one Heavenly Dao. Above the Heavenly Dao, there’s also the Great Dao. The Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity will arrive in the next few calamities. The Dark Forbidden Zone will no longer be safe. Sooner or later, you won’t be able to avoid the calamity and can only enter it. Prepare yourself early. The Buddhist Sect can become your power.”
 After Han Jue heard that, he looked up at Qiu Xilai and asked, “Why do you think so highly of me?”
 Qiu Xilai said, “It’s not that I think highly of you, but the Dao Ancestor’s choice. You’re a variable that the Dao Ancestor has determined. You represent the unknown, like the upcoming Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity.”
 Han Jue was deep in thought.
 The so-called variables were only the unknown, not the savior.
 Why did the Dao Ancestor leave such comments after disappearing?
 Qiu Xilai said, “Su Qi is also your disciple, right? He was used by another Sage. If not for you, I would have directly killed him. In this calamity, I will try my best to protect the living beings who have a good relationship with you. This can be considered my sincerity.”
 Han Jue had no choice but to thank him. “Although I don’t know what Su Qi has done, thank you, Sage. After this calamity, if the Buddhist Sect is in trouble, I will definitely help if I can.”
 If Qiu Xilai helped, Su Qi, the Heavenly Emperor, Xuan Qingjun, and the others could also survive the calamity.
 “Mm.”
 Qiu Xilai responded, and the dream shattered.
 (Qiu Xilai’s favorability towards you has increased. Current favorability: 2 stars]
 After returning to the Connate Cave Abode, Han Jue immediately asked in his mind, “Is Qiu Xilai’s promise sincere?”
 (4 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?] Continue!
 (Yes, unless you become his enemy.]
 Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief.
 The Sage of the Buddhist Sect was not as petty or hypocritical as he had imagined.
 “I want to know why Qiu Xilai treats me so well.” Han Jue continued to derive.
 [1 trillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 A trillion years!
 Even more valuable than Ancestor Xitian?
 It really involved the Dao Ancestor?
 However, a trillion years was nothing to Han Jue. He could only feel his heart ache slightly.
 Continue!
 Han Jue felt uneasy if he didn’t understand it clearly. He didn’t want to be a pawn.
 Immediately after, Han Jue fell into the illusion.
 In a grand palace, the nine Heavenly Dao Sages meditated side by side. Han Jue recognized Sage Fated Secrets and deduced their identities.
 In front of them was an extremely majestic old Daoist. Han Jue looked up and couldn’t see his head. It was really too high.
 He was a Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal, but he was actually unable to cross heights. This meant that there was still a limit to his cultivation realm.
 The legendary Dao Ancestor?
 “The Great Dao Calamity is about to begin. The Primordial Fiendcelestial is about to attack.”
 A loud voice sounded, causing reverence. Primordial Fiendcelestial? Han Jue’s heart trembled.
 Wasn’t he the Primordial Fiendcelestial?
 Qiu Xilai was the first to ask, “Dao Ancestor, what is the Primordial Fiendcelestial?”
 The Dao Ancestor replied, “All of you only know that Pangu split the heavens and transformed it into the Heavenly Dao. Before the creation of the heavens, chaos reigned. The chaos was the beginning of all things, while the Primordial Chaos was the end of all things. After the chaos was the Primordial Chaos, before the chaos was the Primordial Chaos.? The two are not differentiated by first or second. They exist for eternity. The Chaotic Fiendcelestials opened the Dao, and the Primordial Fiendcelestial destroyed the Dao.”
 “When the Primordial Fiendcelestial appears, the Great Dao Calamity will begin. All the Sages will perish. Everything will return to its starting point.”
 The Sages looked at each other.
 Han Jue showed a frown. This time, he couldn’t expose his identity as a Primordial Fiendcelestial. Otherwise, he would become the enemy of the entire world.
 However, he didn’t plan to slaughter the Sages.
 Was it the Dao Ancestor’s guess, or had he deduced the future?
 Sect Master Tian Jue asked, “Dao Ancestor, how many Primordial Fiendcelestials are there?”
 “I don’t know.” The Dao Ancestor’s answer was very simple. Another Sage asked, “Has the Primordial Fiendcelestial been born?”
 “I don’t know.”
 “You can’t deal with the Primordial Fiendcelestial, either?”
 “I no longer exist and have fused with the Heavenly Dao. From now on, there will be no Dao Ancestor. In the future, the Great Dao Calamity can only be faced by you.”
 The Sages were jolted.
 The Dao Ancestor continued, “A variable has appeared in the Heavenly Dao. Even I can’t see through it. Perhaps it will also be a variable in the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity.” With that, the illusion shattered.
 Han Jue’s consciousness returned to reality. His state of mind was extremely unstable.
 The Dao Ancestor’s words pushed Han Jue into an extremely dangerous situation.
 The Primordial Fiendcelestial was him, and the variable was also him.
 What was the Dao Ancestor doing?
 “I want to know if the Dao Ancestor knows that I’m a Primordial Fiendcelestial?” Han Jue asked in his mind.
 (Unable to deduce the karma that exceeds the current limits of the system.)
 Unable?
𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com Then earlier, that was…
 [The derivation just now is the current limit of the system.]
 When Han Jue saw this notification, he couldn’t help but fall into deep thought.
