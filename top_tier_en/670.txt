 Han Jue thought silently. Even if Guan Bubai betrayed him later, he was not afraid. Before these Chaotic Fiendcelestials appeared, he would definitely test their loyalty. Those below six stars would all be thrown into the Primordial Heavenly Prison!
 Han Jue didn’t want to be stabbed in the back!
 Not long after, he threw himself into cultivation again.
 He wanted to break through as soon as possible!
 In a courtyard.
 Long Hao and Han Yu sat at the table and drank happily. Recently, Han Yu’s uneasiness had disappeared and he had returned to his normal state. This made him heave a sigh of relief.
 Although he was confident in his ancestor, if this state lasted for too long, it would also affect his cultivation and Dao heart. He might even suffer from Qi Deviation. “How about it? If we obtain this opportunity, countless geniuses will appear in the Human Race. Your Han family can use this opportunity to soar and greatly increase your status in the Human Race.” Long Hao swirled his wine cup and smiled. Han Yu curled his lips. “If that’s the case, why doesn’t your Dragon Race want it?”. Long Hao chuckled. “Of course we want it. I just want to help you on account of our relationship. The cultivation forces of the Earth Immortal World are not very strong. Now, only the Hidden Sect and the Human School can enter.”
 Han Yu frowned and asked, “Is this the intention of my ancestor?”
 He already knew that his ancestor had an extremely high status in the Hidden Sect. “Your ancestor doesn’t have the time to care about you. I just want to help you and fight for the right to enter the Hidden Sect as soon as possible,” Long Hao said angrily. At first, he only befriended Han Yu because he looked like Han Jue. After interacting with him for so long, the two of them were already very concerned. Recently, he had learned in the Myriad Worlds Projection that Han Jue was about to have a son. This child’s potential was extremely heaven-defying. When this kid descended, Han Jue would definitely forget Han Yu even more.
 In Long Hao’s opinion, no matter how well Han Yu did, he was far inferior to Han Jue.
 The greatest opportunity in the world was to win Han Jue’s favor!
 Han Yu hesitated for a moment and said, “Alright, I’ll bring my Han family disciples there first. If I succeed, I’ll bring the humans in.” Long Hao beamed. “Don’t worry. There are no powerful cultivators in the Earth Immortal World. We’re going to carry out the duty of Immortal Gods and spread our faith to absorb providence.” Han Yu nodded.
 Outside the Heavenly Dao.
 In the city of the Calamity Race, Divine Lord Peacock was meditating and cultivating. He suddenly opened his eyes, which emitted a terrifying cold light. He looked over. An extremely powerful aura was quickly attacking from the depths of the darkness. It was unstoppable. Soon, he saw a mighty figure. It was unknown how tall it was, but it was even larger than the entire Immortal World.
 This figure was bare-chested. His muscles were like huge mountains. He held a huge axe in his hand. The blade was surrounded by visible flames, like the Chaotic Qi when the world was created. It was vast and ancient.
 Divine Lord Peacock frowned. His gaze landed on the giant’s face. This person’s hair was disheveled and his white hair danced wildly. He looked like a demon. His face was wild and the corners of his mouth revealed killing intent and cruelty. “Freedom Realm fellow, what are you doing here in my Heavenly Dao?”
 A cold voice entered Divine Lord Peacock’s ears. Divine Lord Peacock immediately flashed into the darkness and turned to look at the giant. This giant was Han Jue’s good friend, Pan Xin!
 Pan Xin was much younger than before. His body was completely different from before. He had the aura of the legendary Giant God Pangu. “Who are you?” Divine Lord Peacock asked in a low voice. The first thing he thought of was that he was the Dark Forbidden Lord’s disciple. This person revealed that he was a Heavenly Dao living being and was so powerful. He was very likely sent by the Dark Forbidden Lord. Pan Xin said disdainfully, “Remember my name, I’m Pan Xin. No, you won’t have the chance to remember it!”
 With that, he suddenly raised the Heaven-Opening Axe and slashed down angrily. His body was even larger than the Immortal World. Just the terrifying wind stirred up by his raised arm was enough to tear everything apart. The Chaotic Qi in the Dark Forbidden Zone surged violently.
 The Heaven-Opening Axe slashed out with unstoppable force!
 Divine Lord Peacock raised his right hand. A Five-Colored Divine Light shot out from his back and collided with the Heaven-Opening Axe. The Five-Colored Divine Light shattered. The terrifying wind landed on Divine Lord Peacock’s body. In an instant, Divine Lord Peacock’s body was destroyed.
 In the next second, Divine Lord Peacock appeared in another place with a terrified expression. “How can this be?!” Divine Lord Peacock was shocked. His Five-Colored Divine Light was his intrinsic Mystical Power that had been upgraded to a Great Dao Mystical Power. This was his strongest reliance. Even a Great Dao Sage would stagger when brushed by the Five-colored Divine Light. His gaze was fixed on the Heaven-Opening Axe in Pan Xin’s hand. What was that?
 Pan Xin smiled disdainfully and swung his axe again. Divine Lord Peacock was completely furious. Do you really think I’m easy to bully?
 Divine Lord Peacock rushed towards Pan Xin, and a huge battle immediately erupted. In the Heavenly Dao, outside the 33rd Heaven, the Sages were alarmed by the terrifying battle aura.
 Han Jue, who was cultivating, was the same.
 He opened his eyes and recognized that Divine Lord Peacock’s opponent was Pan Xin.
 Holding the Heaven-Opening Axe, Pan Xin was extremely ferocious. He was completely suppressing Divine Lord Peacock. Han Jue was not surprised. After all, Pan Xin had killed his way out of a group of Great Dao Sages. “Why isn’t my Heaven-Opening Axe so powerful?”
 Han Jue was depressed. The Heaven-Opening Axe he had obtained from the system had already been thrown into the system space. Seeing the Heaven-Opening Axe in Pan Xin’s hand, his heart burned again. It had to be said that the Heaven-Opening Axe was really cool. It swept through the world. Who could compete? At the same time, Han Jue mourned for Divine Lord Peacock. He had just returned and was being beaten again. Han Jue didn’t want to interfere. He might not be Pan Xin’s match now. Staying away from trouble was the right choice. “Will Pan Xin harm the Heavenly Dao?” Han Jue asked in his mind.
 The current Pan Xin was indeed powerful. He had to be wary.
 (100 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?] Continue!
 [Not for the time being. He has the providence of the Heavenly Dao. With the death of the Heavenly Dao, his strength will decrease greatly and he will even lose control of the Supreme Treasure.]
 Seeing this line of words, Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief.
 In that case, Pan Xin was on the Heavenly Dao’s side.
 Han Jue closed his eyes.
CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m The thousand-year mark was not reached yet. He couldn’t stop.
 As for Divine Lord Peacock, if he died in Pan Xin’s hands, it meant that he had no fate with the Great Dao.
 However, Han Jue still believed that he could escape.
 This fellow had such a bad temper. If he was going to die, he would have died long ago. In the blink of an eye. Han Jue’s thousand-year seclusion ended. He opened his eyes in shock. Pan Xin and Divine Lord Peacock were still fighting! The two of them had fought for more than six hundred years! They had already entered a deeper space. Only Sages could sense it. It seemed that Pan Xin was still very worried about the Heavenly Dao, afraid that the battle pressure would affect it. Divine Lord Peacock shone with the Five-Colored Divine Light. His speed was extremely fast, turning into afterimages. Even Sages were dazzled.
 Pan Xin couldn’t keep up with his speed. Divine Lord Peacock’s Five-Colored Divine Light was like a blade, causing Pan Xin to be covered in injuries. However, this did not affect him at all. Pan Xin’s aura was still domineering.
 Han Jue’s blood boiled. This was a true battle! “However, I still pursue the path of insta-kill. Although such a battle is exciting, it’s too dangerous.” Han Jue thought silently.
