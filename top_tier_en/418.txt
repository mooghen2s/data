 They gathered the support of the Darkness Sect, the Asura Race, the Dragon Court, the Human School, the Chan School, and other major factions. It could even be said that the Heavenly Court had reached an unprecedentedly powerful golden age. It was even stronger than the Demon Court that had swept through the Immortal World.
 How much time had passed?
 Han Jue was shocked by the power of the Sages.
 However, Han Jue had a feeling that the stronger the Heavenly Court was, the more likely they would be defeated. The battle of the Immeasurable Calamity could not be a crushing one. Either both sides were evenly matched, both sides injured each other, or the weaker side reversed the tide.
 The Heavenly Dao wanted a small number of people to survive, after all.
 “I’ll just be a member of the audience and watch them collapse.”
 Han Jue thought silently. The Heavenly Emperor was already gone and the current Heavenly Court was beginning to rise again. He had repaid the favor he owed.
 If not for his secret help, the Heavenly Court and the Heavenly Emperor would have been long gone.
 There was another goal now.
 Kill Jade Emperor Zhou Yan and save the Heavenly Emperor.
 Han Jue took out the Book of Misfortune and cursed Jade Emperor Zhou Yan.
 Several days later, he continued cultivating.
 The Zenith Heaven Realm was extremely difficult to cultivate. Han Jue’s Zenith Heaven Dao Fruit was like a bottomless pit. When the negative karma in the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus surged into it, the Dao Fruit felt like it would never be filled.
 Han Jue couldn’t estimate when he would break through to the mid-stage Golden Immortal Realm.
 The path of the Great Dao was long-lasting!
 Time passed.
 While the Hidden Sect was cultivating in seclusion, the war between the Humans and Gods in the Immortal World finally began.
 The human race had an extremely strong reproduction ability. In just a few decades, billions of people could appear. This was under the condition that the human race was constantly fighting. The humans of the Immortal World had an extremely huge population, let alone the humans of the myriad worlds. They were the protagonists of the Heavenly Dao.
 Facing the powerful Heavenly Court, the humans were first attacked and defeated, but the characteristics of the humans were also displayed.
 They would never give up!
 The more humans lost, the more united they became.
 The cultivators from the other mortal worlds rushed to the Immortal World to provide assistance. A world-shattering battle was brewing.
 About thirty years passed.
 Han Jue walked out of the cave abode and prepared to preach the Dao to the Hidden Sect disciples.
 Lu Huaxu suddenly came in front of him and bowed. “Grandmaster, the Divine Investiture Board is summoning me. What do you think I should do?”
 Han Jue said, “Don’t go. You’ll die.” Lu Huaxu’s eyelids twitched.
 Although he had already awakened the memories of the Purple Star Emperor, his reverence for Han Jue deepened. Because like the others, he felt that Han Jue might be the reincarnation of the Dao Ancestor.
 Looking at the Hidden Sect disciples, they could all form a huge faction. Previously, the Heavenly Court only had five Zenith Heavens. The Four Extreme Emperors had not been in the Heavenly Court for a long time, and there were already three in the Hidden Sect. Lü Bu and Ma Chao were both manifestations of Zu Tu.
 One had to know that Zu Tu alone could fight against the Four Extreme Emperors.
 “Everyone, sit down and prepare to listen!”
 Han Jue walked around Lu Huaxu and sat in front of the Fusang Tree.
 After everyone was ready, he began to preach.
 Han Jue also didn’t want to stay in the Dark Forbidden Zone. After the calamity ended, he would still go to the Immortal World.
 However, before that, he had to make the Hidden Sect stronger. This way, he could cultivate in peace and let his disciples protect the Hidden Sect.
 Apart from the Hidden Sect, the Reroll World was also becoming stronger.
 One day, the Reroll World would surpass the mortal world and become a great world. Han Jue was also looking forward to that day.
 The White-Robed Buddha’s cultivation level increased quite quickly, and he had already reached the Rank Three Immortal Emperor Realm. It was all thanks to the Reroll World’s providence.
 Seven years later.
 Han Jue ended the lecture.
 This time, he did not return to the cave abode directly. Instead, he waited for the disciples to awaken.
 A year later.
 All the disciples woke up and saw that Han Jue was still around. They continued to wait for him to speak
 Han Jue said, “The true battle of this calamity is about to begin. The battle between the humans and the Heavenly Court.”
 Everyone was stunned. Murong Qi asked in surprise, “Where’s the Divine Palace? Where’s the Buddhist Sect? Where’s the Demon Court?”.
 Tu Ling’er added, “What about the Golden Crow Divine Clan?”
 At the mention of the Golden Crow Divine Clan, Jiang Yi’s expression became unnatural. Could it be that the Golden Crow Divine Clan was already gone? Chu Shiren pinched his fingers to deduce and his expression changed drastically. Xun Chang’an noticed his expression and asked, “What did you deduce?”
 Xun Chang’an still couldn’t change his attitude. He always cared about Chu Shiren.
 After all, he was born in the Buddhist Sect and Chu Shiren was a Buddha.
 “All the major powers have joined the Heavenly Court to suppress the humans. Someone wants to overthrow the identity of the humans as the protagonist under the Heavenly Dao. What a move!” Chu Shiren’s expression was ugly. He was the Supreme Buddha whose philosophy was to make peace for all living beings. His Buddhist Way focused on humans, so he naturally did not want the humans to be slaughtered. When the disciples heard that, they were all shocked. How could the Heavenly Court be so powerful?
 Han Jue said, “Do you see? This is the Immeasurable Calamity. This is fate. The once high-spirited and insufferably arrogant behemoths can all become stepping stones. The Hidden Sect does not fight for providence or power. What we fight for is the Great Dao. Cultivate well and don’t think about going out. After the Immeasurable Calamity ends, we will return to the Immortal World.”
 The Chaotic Heavenly Dog shouted, “We still have to go back? Why can’t we stay here!”
 The Black Hell Chicken flapped its wings and scolded, “How dare you refute Master’s will?”
 The others’ eyes lit up. Not everyone wanted to stay away from the world.
 Cultivation was sometimes only for the sake of being superior to others.
 “Before this calamity ends, I hope that all of you can reach the Emperor Realm. Can you do that?” Han Jue asked.
 All Immortal Emperors!
 This goal made everyone excited.
 Even if it was a major force in the Immortal World, there were not many Immortal Emperors.
 “Definitely!” Lu Huaxu said in high spirits. The others agreed.
 The Black Hell Demon Lord, Diamond Rage, and Jiang Yi looked at each other in shock.
 They felt Han Jue’s ambitions.
 Could it be that he was plotting for the next calamity?
 It was very likely!
 Wasn’t this the path of the previous Divine Palace?
 The Divine Palace had risen after the calamity ended. Taking advantage of the chaos in the world and the fact that order had yet to be rebuilt, it had appeared in one go and widely accepted geniuses, rising step by step.
 Han Jue smiled in satisfaction and returned to the Connate Cave Abode.
 The Strange Deity pounced over.
 Han Jue waved his hand and gestured for it to scram.
VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience The Strange Deity seemed to be very anxious and kept rebuking him. Han Jue frowned and immediately checked the powerful enemies around the Dao Field.
 There were no powerful enemies.
 What was going on?
 At this moment, the Strange Deity suddenly entered Han Jue’s body, and a huge memory surged into his mind.
 It was a distant memory.
 It was a misty void. Violent winds wreaked havoc in all directions. In Han Jue’s vision, the clouds parted and he saw a majestic figure. It was even larger than the Primordial Yuan Phoenix he had seen before.
 Even Han Jue, a Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal, couldn’t help but be shocked when he saw this figure.
 Too huge to describe!
 For some reason, Han Jue inexplicably thought of the legendary Pangu who split open the sky!
 Giant God Pangu? Why did the strange god let him see this memory?
 At this moment, Han Jue suddenly felt a terrifying gaze land on him. Although he didn’t see that gaze, he could feel the pressure. It was a pressure that made his soul tremble.
