 So easy to deceive?
 In Qiu Xilai’s eyes, the Heavenly Dao Spirit’s methods were truly ridiculous. Its motives were too obvious. There was no need to guess.
 The Heavenly Dao Spirit said, “Han Jue’s son’s cultivation is becoming stronger and stronger. He can actually catch up to Yi Tian. He will definitely become a huge problem in the future. If you don’t dare to deal with Han Jue, before you obtain the Dao Ancestor’s clone, you can think of a way to eliminate Han Jue’s son.”
 “I’ll consider it.”
 Qiu Xilai closed his eyes and continued his Dao Integration.
 The Heavenly Dao Spirit did not say anything else and vanished from the hall.
 After obtaining the Killing Dao Token, Han Jue didn’t wander around or leave the Daoist temple to preach the Dao. Instead, he focused on cultivating.
 Time passed quickly. Another two thousand years passed.
 On this day, Han Jue checked his emails.
 (Your disciple Zhou Fan has returned to the Immortal World.] He heaved a sigh of relief. The big shot was still stable and had saved his Dharma idol reincarnation.
 He looked up and saw Zhou Fan’s other emails. Other than constantly dying and reviving, there were actually opportunities!
 (Your disciple Zhou Fan has fused with the Paradise Purgatory’s providence. His cultivation has increased greatly.]
 (Your disciple Zhou Fan has comprehended a Great Dao Mystical Power.]
 How impressive! As expected of the protagonist! Han Jue looked up and saw that Zhou Fan had already returned to the Chaotic City.
 This kid’s cultivation had actually reached the mid-stage of the Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm. He had benefited from a disaster and was even comparable to Dao Sovereign.
 Han Jue looked at Dao Sovereign. Ever since he was stimulated by Su Qi, Dao Sovereign had been in seclusion every day and cultivated very crazily. He was also getting closer and closer to the late-stage Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm.
 Han Jue was very satisfied with this. Dao Sovereign was even more reckless than Zhou Fan in the past. It was naturally a good thing that he could be so persistent now.
 Han Jue continued to look at the disciples under the Fusang Tree. He suddenly stood up and disappeared.
 He came to the Fusang Tree.
 The disciples stood up and bowed when they saw him.
 Han Jue ignored them and looked at the Fusang Tree.
 The tree was still so majestic and looked very calm. There was nothing unusual, but Han Jue felt that the Fusang Tree was absorbing a strange power that came from the hundreds of space-time vortexes it had formed.
 Han Jue asked with a voice transmission, “What are you doing?”
 “Huh?”
 The Fusang Tree panicked.
 Han Jue waved his sleeve and moved all the nearby disciples away. He set up a barrier around them and asked the Fusang Tree alone.
 The tree’s action would expose its location to hundreds of worlds. Most importantly, it had not asked Han Jue.
 Frightened, the Fusang Tree hurriedly said, “I just feel that I can absorb their power and become stronger, so I’m doing this… Is something wrong?”
 “Didn’t I say not to expose your location?” “I won’t, I’m just absorbing power.”
 “The power of the world is surging towards you. The mighty cultivators can’t sense the direction of the power?”
 “I…”
 “Why didn’t you tell me?”
 “I want to transform… You don’t seem to want me to transform…”
 Han Jue frowned. “It’s not that I don’t want to transform. It’s just that you’re the Heavenly Dao Divine Tree and can’t transform for the time being.”
 His words were the truth. Now that the Dao Field was filled with Spirit Qi, the Fusang Tree was no longer very useful.

 Han Jue probed the tree with his Sage Sense and checked the power it had absorbed.
 It looked like providence, but also like merit. It was difficult to tell.
 This was the first time Han Jue had encountered such a force. It was strong but not ferocious. It flowed like endless warm water in the Fusang Tree. “What power is this?”
 (3 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [Heaven and Earth Origin: A source of power that can only be born in a place with its own rules. If the Heaven and Earth Origin is sucked dry, this world will collapse.]
 So terrifying?
 Han Jue suddenly felt that the Fusang Tree was not a divine tree, but an evil tree!
 If it absorbed hundreds of worlds like this, how many living beings would die?
 Han Jue said, “If you continue to do this, all the living beings in the world might die.” The Fusang Tree said indifferently, “I can choose not to absorb everything. Besides, the Spirit Qi I emit is also absorbed by living beings. Why can only others absorb me and I can’t absorb them?”
 Han Jue frowned. These words were very reasonable, but they felt strange.
 Under the Sun and Moon Yin-Yang Protection’s light, the Fusang Tree couldn’t see Han Jue’s expression, but once he went silent, it felt very uneasy.
 It was most afraid of him.
 Han Jue saw that the Fusang Tree was trembling slightly and the leaves were rustling. His heart softened.
 Perhaps he was too cautious and too harsh on the Fusang Tree. “Other than the Chiliocosm World, you can absorb the power of other worlds, but you can’t go overboard. The longer they exist, the more helpful they will be to you,” Han Jue said. With the Dark Sage King in the Chiliocosm World, it was very easy to find his Dao Field. The Fusang Tree said happily, “Don’t worry. I can sense danger everywhere. I’ve never absorbed the power of the Chiliocosm World before.”
 Han Jue nodded and removed the barrier. He then turned around and left.
 Han Jur sighed after returning to the Daoist temple.
 His disciples had already grown up and had their own thoughts and opinions. Time passed really quickly. Even a tree had its own opinions.
 Han Jue checked his interpersonal relationships. He was relieved after confirming that the favorability of the disciples didn’t decrease.
 He was about to cultivate when a notification appeared in front of him.
 (Li Muyi wants to visit you in your dreams. Do you want to accept?] What was this fellow trying to do?
 Another request for help?
 Han Jue wanted to refuse, but on second thought, it was fine to listen to what he had to say.
 What if he had important information?
 Han Jue chose to accept and entered the dream.
 The Sage Dao Field was as bright as a paradise.
 Li Muyi came in front of him and said, “Fellow Daoist Han, long time no see. How’s your cultivation?”
 Han Jue said politely, “It’s alright. Why are you looking for me?”
 “The Heavenly Dao has developed intelligence. It’s the sign of the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity.”
 Li Muyi sighed, his eyes filled with uneasiness.
 Han Jue already knew about this, so he was not surprised.
 Li Muyi continued, “The Heavenly Dao is impartial because it is emotionless. In front of it, all living beings are equal. For example, if the Heavenly Dao developed intelligence, it might have greed. This is an unprecedented calamity. In the past calamities, we Sages could join forces to destroy them, but now, we can’t deal with the Heavenly Dao. The situation is troublesome.”
 Han Jue asked, “Then, what do you need me to do?”
 “You used your strength to attain the Dao and are not controlled by the Heavenly Dao. Is there a way to destroy the Heavenly Dao’s intelligence without harming it?”
 “You’re thinking too much. The Heavenly Dao was created by Giant God Pangu and has been consolidated by the Dao Ancestor. Even ten thousand of me are not the Heavenly Dao’s match.”
 “Then, can you visit Ancestor Xitian and ask him to help?” “The ancestor has returned?”
 “Mm.”
 Han Jue hesitated. “My relationship with the ancestor is average. How can I persuade him? Find someone else.”
 Ancestor Xitian was too strong. Han Jue didn’t want to meet him.
