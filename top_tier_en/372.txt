 Wait.
 The Dao Ancestor who bound the Sages had already vanished. So what if they crossed the line now?
 Han Jue asked, “Your Majesty, don’t you have the support of a Sage?”
 The Heavenly Emperor smiled bitterly. “The Heavenly Court is backed by the Heavenly Dao. The other Sages won’t touch it, afraid that they will be affected by the Heavenly Dao’s karma.”
 Nonsense!
 I saw you plotting with a Sage!
 Han Jue ridiculed him in his heart, but he didn’t dare to refute.
 He asked, “How’s Hao’er’s situation? Has he still not returned?”
 “Hmph, don’t mention him. He has already become an enemy of the Heavenly Court.”
 “Why? What happened?”
 “Don’t ask about these things. I’ll be ashamed if I tell you.”
 “Fine.”
 The Heavenly Emperor had said so, so Han Jue didn’t ask further.
 The two of them ended the contact after a few words. Han Jue clearly realized that something big had happened in the Heavenly Court.
 However, since the Heavenly Emperor was unwilling to say it, he did not ask.
 After putting down the Heavenly Dao Token, Han Jue looked at the Dao Pills.
 He opened the bottle and took out a Dao Pill to consume.
 To be able to help a Deity Realm cultivator cultivate, it had to be said that the Human School was truly impressive. It was said that alchemy originated from the Human School.
 No wonder the two disciples of the Human School were so strong. With medicinal pills and resources, their cultivation levels were naturally not low. Of course, the Human School’s teachings were powerful, to begin with. After the Dao Pill entered his body, it directly transformed into boundless Connate Qi that flowed wantonly in his body and transformed into Divine Origin Dharmic powers.
 It was very effective!
 Han Jue was a little surprised. He originally thought that this pill didn’t have much effect and was useless. He didn’t expect him to underestimate the Human School’s foundation.
 Several days later.
 After Han Jue consumed this Dao Pill, it was better than decades of bitter cultivation.
 He continued to consume it.
 Two months later.
 Han Jue finished consuming all the Dao Pills. His cultivation had already reached the critical point and was about to break through to the Three Mystic Divine Origin.
 Han Jue opened his eyes. He was extremely grateful to the Heavenly Emperor.
 Such a divine pill was a priceless treasure. The Heavenly Emperor had actually given him ten Dao Pills at once.
 Next, he could prepare to break through.
 Heavenly Court, Numinous Palace.
 The Heavenly Emperor and Li Daokong were alone.
 Li Daokong smiled and asked, “Have you distributed the twenty Dao Pills?”
 The Heavenly Emperor smiled. “Yes, thank the Sect Master for me.”
 Li Daokong shook his head and smiled. “Now that the Sages have entered the calamity, the Human School has to support you. I heard from my master that the Great Dao Calamity might arrive after several calamities. There isn’t much time for the Heavenly Dao. If the Heavenly Court can win the calamity, you can cross the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End and head to the Ancient Desolate. You can make preparations early.”
 The Heavenly Emperor’s smile vanished as he asked, “What do you think of your junior’s recent actions?”
 His eyes narrowed with killing intent.
 Li Daokong didn’t seem to sense his killing intent as he said, “He only has himself to blame. If he wants to stop the Heavenly Court, I will personally suppress him. Your Majesty, you don’t have to worry about him. He just wants to go against me. There’s no conspiracy.”
 The Heavenly Emperor was deep in thought. Li Daokong continued, “Zu Tu isn’t dead. I caught a hint of him and plan to hunt him down.”
 The Heavenly Emperor replied, “Don’t do this for the time being. Zu Tu escaped by abandoning everything, so he’s not a threat. Now that the Divine Palace has collapsed, the Heavenly Court needs to annex them and the Demon Court before making preparations.”
 Li Daokong nodded.
 “Di Lantian of the Golden Crow Divine Clan has been restless recently. He wants to raise the banner of the Ancient Heavenly Court and absorb the ancient races. You will represent the Heavenly Court to deal with them,” the Heavenly Emperor said casually. Li Daokong immediately agreed.
 Seven years later.
 Han Jue successfully broke through to the Three Mystic Divine Origin.
 His Divine Origin Dharmic powers soared as he basked in the sublimating comfort.
 As he consolidated his cultivation, he checked his attributes panel.
 [Name: Han Jue]
 [Race: Primordial Fiendcelestial]
 (Cultivation: Three Mystic Divine Origin]
 (Technique: Primordial Chaos Reincarnation Great Dao, Heavenly Cycle Body Tempering]
 [Great Dao: Great Dao of Life and Death, Great Dao of Karma]
 This breakthrough doubled his lifespan!
 Not only did it make up for his losses, but the total also increased greatly.
 Han Jue looked at his lifespan and felt a sense of achievement.
 It was all thanks to the Heavenly Emperor that he had saved a period of bitter cultivation. Otherwise, he would have to wait for at least another 200 years.
 Han Jue continued to consolidate his cultivation.
 Three years later, his cultivation level had completely stabilized. He took out the Book of Misfortune and prepared to curse Zu Tu.
 Since this fellow only had a trace of his remnant soul left, he might as well curse him to death to prevent unnecessary trouble.
 There would definitely be new enemies in the future. Han Jue didn’t want to be tied down by the fallen enemies.
 No matter how cunning you are, I’ll kill you!
 Han Jue injected his Divine Origin Dharmic powers into the Book of Misfortune and cursed with all his might.
 Five days later. His lifespan began to decrease.
 This time, Han Jue was determined to kill Zu
 Tu.
 1 billion years of lifespan!
 2 billion years of lifespan!
 5 billion years of lifespan!
 8 billion years of lifespan!
 [Nüwa wants to visit you in your dreams. Do you accept?]
 A line of words suddenly appeared in front of Han Jue. He couldn’t help but be stunned.
 He immediately thought of something. Perhaps it was related to Zu Tu.
 Could it be that Zu Tu looked for a Sage to help him?
 Since Sages couldn’t spy on the Dao Field, they could only use this method. The Heavenly Emperor had used it before.
 Han Jue hesitated. Should he accept it?
 If he accepted it, would he be exposed?
 Originally, Sages couldn’t spy on the Dao Field. If he entered the dream world, would she find an opportunity?
 Wait!
 What am I afraid of?
 I have Empress Houtu behind me!
 If Zu Tu survived, he would definitely continue to find trouble with him in the future. It was impossible to resolve it.
 Han Jue gritted his teeth and continued cursing This fellow had to die!
 [Nüwa wants to visit you in your dreams. Do you accept?]
 [Nüwa wants to visit you in your dreams. Do you accept?]
 [Nüwa wants to visit you in your dreams. Do you accept?]
 Such notifications kept appearing in front of Han Jue. He pretended not to see them. Finally.
 When Han Jue’s lifespan was deducted to ten billion years, his curse suddenly ended.
 He asked in his heart, “Is Zu Tu dead?”
Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates [Zu Tu’s body and soul have been destroyed. He is dead.]
 Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief. He felt more at ease now.
 It was worth mentioning that Nüwa did not hate him.
 It seemed that Nüwa didn’t realize that the Dark Forbidden Lord was Han Jue.
 She had only used some Mystical Power to trace the curse. If Han Jue agreed just now, wouldn’t it reveal that he was the Dark Forbidden Lord?
 The more Han Jue thought about it, the more glad he was.
 He was almost frightened by the Sage.
 The Book of Misfortune might be deduced by a Sage, but with the Dao Field, it was very difficult for a Sage to deduce it.
 “In the future, the curse can only be done in the Dao Field. I can’t bring the Book of Misfortune out.”
 Han Jue thought silently, and his eyes became firm.
 Although his cultivation level was constantly increasing, he still had to tread on thin ice from now on, and he could not be careless.
 Several months later.
 Han Jue suddenly felt Empress Houtu’s aura. It was obvious that she was deliberately emitting it and waiting for him to see her. Therefore, Han Jue spread his divine sense and quickly arrived in front of her.
 Empress Houtu’s body was filled with a blinding light. Her true appearance could not be seen.
 “Empress, what’s the matter?” Han Jue asked.
 He suddenly thought of something and felt his blood run cold. Empress Houtu couldn’t see through the Dao Field either, but knowing Han Jue’s existence, could it be that only his Dao Field could not be seen through by the Sages in the entire Immortal World?
 Through this point, if they deduced…
