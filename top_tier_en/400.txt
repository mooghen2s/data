 Han Jue, who was cultivating, sensed that Xing Hongxuan was using the Invocation Technique. He stood up and stepped into the black vortex.
 Next, there was another commotion that lasted for half a year.
 Han Jue tidied his clothes and walked to the table to sit down. He asked, “How’s the situation in the Immortal World recently?”
 He didn’t dare to rashly extend his divine sense, in case a mighty figure guarding the human race would immediately capture him.
 Xing Hongxuan replied, “Negative karma pervades the world. The people live in misery. Not to mention the humans, the other races are even more chaotic. With the constant killing, it feels like the primordial era.”
 Xing Hongxuan sighed.
 She had long heard that the Immeasurable Calamity was very terrifying. She didn’t expect it to be to this extent.
 She had previously gone out with a group of human cultivators and seen true mountains of corpses and seas of blood. Han Jue asked, “Are the humans still going to continue fighting with the Heavenly Court?”
 “No, but the humans are clearly ambitious. I wonder who their next enemy will be.”
 Xing Hongxuan sighed worriedly.
 She walked to Han Jue’s side and sat down. She started to pour him tea.
 This tea was not simple. It contained Connate Qi. One had to know that Xing Hongxuan was still a Grand Unity Golden Immortal, so she only needed Immortal Qi. To be using this so early, how extravagant was that?
 The Human Race really thought highly of Xing Hongxuan!
 “By the way, do you know Zhao Xuanyuan?” Han Jue asked.
 Xing Hongxuan asked in surprise, “Haven’t you been in seclusion? How do you know Zhao Xuanyuan? He’s a peerless prodigy hidden among the humans. Like me, he has obtained the inheritance of a Sage. Furthermore, he has an unprecedented Chaotic Physique. In my master’s words, he’s the person with the greatest hope of attaining the Dao below the Heavenly Dao.”
 Han Jue shook his head and laughed. “The Heavenly Court’s Dao Sovereign also has a Chaotic Physique, and he has yet to mature.”
 Xing Hongxuan smiled and said, “Indeed, I also think that he’s bragging too much. Compared to my husband, who does Zhao Xuanyuan think he is? You don’t know how proud he usually is. He doesn’t even look at us directly.”
 Was he that arrogant?
 Han Jue thought about Zhao Xuanyuan in the Chaotic Domain. Why did he seem so aggrieved?
 Han Jue stopped thinking about him. Instead, he stared at Xing Hongxuan and said, “Try not to enter the calamity in the future. You can use the excuse of being a Sage’s disciple to cultivate in peace. The human race won’t make things difficult for you.”
 “I know. Husband, what do you think of Empress Nüwa?”
 Xing Hongxuan changed the topic and asked curiously.
 Han Jue scolded. “Don’t talk about the Sage behind her back. You should be grateful that you obtained her inheritance.”
 Xing Hongxuan stuck out her tongue and said in embarrassment, “That’s true.”
 She wasn’t stupid and immediately understood what Han Jue meant.
 She didn’t believe that Han Jue really respected anyone. This fellow even dared to fight against immortals when he was a mortal.
 Han Jue was definitely afraid of the power of a Sage!
 Xing Hongxuan winked at him playfully.
 Han Jue stood up and said, “I’m leaving. Be careful. If there’s any danger, use the Invocation Technique at any time.”
 Xing Hongxuan nodded, her heart filled with joy.
 She wasn’t happy about Han Jue’s promise, but his attitude.
 “Chang Yue’er, Mo Zhu, how can you compare to me?”
 After Han Jue left, Xing Hongxuan smiled proudly.
 After returning to the Connate Cave Abode, Han Jue didn’t cultivate. Instead, he walked out of the cave abode and prepared to preach the Dao for the Hidden Sect.
 Seeing him walk out, the disciples stood up.
 The Black Hell Chicken suddenly shouted, “Master, why do you smell like a woman? I think it’s Xing Hongxuan? She had this scent when she came out of your cave abode before!”
 Han Jue glanced at it with a cold gaze, scaring it.
 With a thought, the aura vanished.
 The others pretended not to hear.
 “Prepare to listen to the Dao!”
 Han Jue’s words excited everyone.
 Another lecture!
 This lecture lasted for several years. Every time Han Jue preached the Dao, everyone in the Hidden Sect would gain enlightenment because his speed of improvement far exceeded others.
 After the lecture, Han Jue continued cultivating
 In the blink of an eye, 32 years passed.
 Han Jue was getting closer and closer to the Six Mystic Divine Origin.
 The momentum of the world became more and more intense.
 Han Jue’s uneasiness increased. He wasn’t in the Immortal World, but he could feel it.
 Perhaps, he had already entered the calamity unknowingly.
 On this day. Hidden Sect Island suddenly shook as if it had been hit by something. Han Jue was shocked. He opened his eyes and saw that it was absolutely dark outside Hidden Sect Island. He couldn’t see anything.
 His divine sense was useless outside.
 Boom
 The Hidden Sect Island shook again.
 This time, even the people from the Hidden Sect panicked.
 “What’s happening?”
 “Enemy attack?”
 “Don’t panic, the Sect Master is still here!”
Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates “Grandmaster didn’t attack immediately. Could it be that there’s a powerful enemy that we can’t defeat?”
 “Senior Lü Bu isn’t moving. Don’t worry.”
 Han Jue asked in the cave abode, “I want to know who attacked Hidden Sect Island!”
 [2 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Two billion years…
 Han Jue gritted his teeth and chose to continue.
 He wasn’t stingy, but nervous. Two billion years was still a Zenith Heaven!
 (Inauspicious Evil: The mysterious power of the Dark Forbidden Zone. It is condensed from the grudges of the ancient Chaotic Fiendcelestials. It hides the chaos and transforms into darkness. If you can withstand this for an hour, the Inauspicious Evil will retreat.]
 An hour?
 Han Jue frowned. Could the Dao Field stop it?
 He could only wait patiently. Currently, the Inauspicious Evil did not invade Hidden Sect Island. It was only that Hidden Sect Island was shaking and looked to be in danger. Han Jue sent a voice transmission to everyone, telling them to calm down.
 Hearing his words, everyone was relieved.
 Over the long years, Han Jue had already become the pillar of support for everyone in the Hidden Sect. As long as he didn’t panic, they didn’t have to be afraid even if the sky collapsed.
 The collision sounds continued.
 Seconds passed.
 In the end, an hour passed and the Inauspicious Evil left.
 Han Jue was secretly surprised.
 This Inauspicious Evil was only a power without consciousness?
 Previously, when he read the emails, he saw someone being attacked by the Inauspicious Evil. He really didn’t know how that fellow survived!
 Perhaps there were strong and weak ones among them.
 Until now, Han Jue didn’t sense anything and only knew of their existence.
 This power was too mysterious. Even Deity Realm experts couldn’t spy on it.
 The more Han Jue thought about it, the more his blood ran cold. How many unknown and strange mysterious powers were hidden under the Great Dao?
 To prevent himself from being attacked by the Inauspicious Evil again, Han Jue had no choice but to move to Hidden Sect Island.
 “No wonder no one is hiding in the Dark Forbidden Zone. This place is also dangerous.”
 Han Jue thought silently.
 After moving for a while, a line of words suddenly appeared in front of him.
 [Detected bearer of Connate providence, check its origin.)
 Eh?
 Connate providence?
 It had been a long time since Han Jue saw this notification. He thought that this function had been abandoned by the system.
 He immediately chose to check.
 [Strange Deity: Unknown existence. It has inherited the providence of the Chaotic Fiendcelestial and has been nurtured for countless eras. It is about to become a spirit.]
 It had inherited the providence of the Chaotic Fiendcelestial…
 Amazing!
 However, this name looked very dangerous. Han Jue’s first reaction was to stay away from it.
