 Han Jue took out the Sun and Moon Yin-Yang Protection. This treasure had two rings of light, both circular. He couldn’t tell which was the sun and which was the moon.
 He began to make it recognize him as its master.
 After a few days, he finally succeeded.
 The Sun and Moon Yin-Yang Protection automatically flew behind Han Jue and floated in the air. It emitted light, and the strong light drowned his figure. One could only see his rough figure and couldn’t see his true appearance. This strong light could only affect others and didn’t affect Han Jue’s vision at all.
 Not bad!
 It was a very impressive-looking thing.
 A mighty figure had to look like a mighty figure. Han Jue didn’t want a Zenith Heaven like him to appear like a mortal.
 He had to be impressive. Look at the Heavenly Emperor. Previously, when he stood in the Numinous Palace, the gods looked tiny.
 There was also Qiu Xilai who only revealed the statue and not his true body.
 When he returned to the Immortal World in the future, the world would see Han Jue but not his true appearance.
 How could a mortal spy on the face of a Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal?
 Han Jue thought in boredom.
 His imagination was useless but interesting.
 Han Jue began to be curious about the new Heavenly Dao Race.
 (A billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 (Heavenly Race: Originally humans, after undergoing the baptism of the Heavenly Dao, they became immortal gods. Through the supreme power of the Sages, they became a new race. This race has human nature, divinity, and powerful talent that rivals the Connate Races.]
 Han Jue was stunned.
 The Immortal Gods of the Human Race were a new race?
CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m How vicious!
 This plan was too ruthless. It fawned on the humans and Heavenly Court, and also cleaned up most of the living beings in the two forces.
 They were both humans and immortals. There were definitely few such existences.
 Apart from the Heavenly Race, all living beings would be annihilated. The Heavenly Dao Calamity would finally end.
 The Immortal World would return to its original state and develop again.
 Han Jue checked his interpersonal relationships. Ji Xianshen, Xuan Qingjun, Fang Liang, the Divine General, and Su Qi had all become part of the Heavenly Race. Poor Zhou Fan and Mo Fuchou had missed the opportunity to avoid the calamity. To be precise, Mo Fuchou was the most pitiful. Zhou Fan had a powerful background and would definitely not die. However, this didn’t concern Han Jue.
 Since he wanted to fight, he had to bear the consequences.
 Han Jue closed his eyes and started cultivating.
 Another fifty years passed. Ever since he knew that the calamity was about to end, Han Jue felt as if he was possessed. He kept thinking about when it would end. With this mentality, time passed quickly, faster than any previous stage.
 Han Jue cultivated every day and cursed Sage Fated Secrets once every ten years. Other than that, there was nothing else to do.
 He even read fewer emails.
 He didn’t want to be swayed by the emails. The later the calamity, the more he couldn’t enter it!
 He had already endured until now. All his efforts would be in vain.
 Han Jue had already done what he had to. Even if his friends died, there was nothing he could
 do.
 On this day, Han Jue placed his attention on the Chaotic Origin Stone in the world of stars.
 After so many years, the Chaotic Qi produced by the Chaotic Origin Stone had already reached a majestic level. In addition to the nebulous Primordial Qi produced by the Stellar Primordial Body, the entire world of stars was in a daze.
 Han Jue discovered that hundreds of new stars had been born in the world of stars.
 This was only the beginning. There would be more in the future.
 It was worth mentioning that other than the White-Robed Buddha, the Reroll World had finally given birth to an Immortal Emperor.
 The Spirit Qi of the Reroll World had already surpassed most mortal worlds and might even surpass all mortal worlds. In a situation where resources were not scarce, reaching the Immortal Emperor Realm depended on one’s potential.
 After all, the Human Race was once the protagonist of the Heavenly Dao. There were also geniuses in a tiny mortal world.
 Han Jue didn’t rope in this prodigy. The Reroll World had to develop on its own.
 Currently, there were enough prodigies in the Hidden Sect.
 He would wait for this batch of disciples to develop first.
 Everything was getting better and stronger.
 Han Jue warned himself to stay true to his heart and maintain his current pace. He didn’t want to provoke a Sage easily.

 (Li Muyi wants to visit you in your dreams. Do you want to continue?]
 [Li Muyi wants to visit you in your dreams. Do you want to continue?]
 Li Muyi started to spam again! Han Jue’s good mood vanished.
 Ignore! Han Jue checked the emails to divert his attention.
 (Your good friend Ji Xianshen has become the leader of the Heavenly Race. His providence has transformed.)
 ce
 [Your grand-disciple Fang Liang has fused with the providence of the Heavenly Court. His cultivation has increased greatly.]
 (Your good friend Zhou Fan has obtained the Dharmic powers of a Sage. His providence has increased greatly.]
 (Your good friend Jing Tiangong was attacked by your good friend Jiang Dugu and was severely injured.]
 (Your good friend Xue Minghe was attacked by your good friend Jiang Dugu and died.] [Your good friend Huang Zuntian was attacked by your good friend Jiang Dugu and was severely injured.)
 (Your good friend Jiang Dugu was attacked by your good friend Li Daokong and was severely injured.)
 (Your good friend Di Lantian was attacked by your good friend Pan Xin and was severely injured.)
 [Your good friend Heavenly Emperor was suppressed by a Sage and was severely injured.)
 Many of them were severely injured!
 Xue Minghe had even died!
 Han Jue sighed. Although he didn’t have a good impression of Xue Minghe, this fellow treated him very well and listened to him. He felt a little uncomfortable that he died just like this. However, there was no choice. Xue Minghe entering the calamity was his own wish.
 Cultivation was already a heaven-defying thing. It was normal to die on this path.
 The Heavenly Emperor was also severely injured, but he was not dead. If a Sage wanted to kill him, he would definitely not survive.
 Apart from that, Ji Xianshen had actually become the leader of the Heavenly Race. It was unknown if it was related to him.
 Han Jue kept suspecting that the great opportunities his good friends obtained were all related to him. It wasn’t that he was narcissistic, but that he was afraid of being schemed against by a Sage. Han Jue thought for a moment and decided to visit Jing Tiangong in his dreams. One was to comfort him, and the other was to assess the situation.
 Soon, the two of them entered the dream.
 Jing Tiangong suddenly opened his eyes. He was pleasantly surprised to see the black shadow ahead.
 He hurriedly knelt down and said, “Forbidden Lord! You’re finally here!
 “You’re right. This calamity is a complete trap. We shouldn’t have entered it.”
 He had a look of regret. Clearly, the Jie School had suffered heavy losses.
 Han Jue said, “Xue Minghe is dead. I already know. What do you think of the current calamity?”
 Jing Tiangong secretly admired the Dark Forbidden Lord’s remarkable abilities. He even knew this.
 He thought for a moment and said, “Sage Jin’an established the Heavenly Race with the Immortal Gods of the Human Race and changed the situation of the calamity. The Human Race and the Heavenly Court have reached a compromise. All the humans want to become the Heavenly Race. In order to do that, they have to rely on Heavenly Emperor Fang’s Divine Investiture Board. However, the other races can’t become the Heavenly Race. Now, the Human Race and the Heavenly Court are being attacked by the other races. The situation is not good.
 “Most importantly, the attitude of the Sages is unknown. They appear from time to time and sweep through the various battlefields. They even fight among themselves. Previously, when the Sages fought in the nine heavens, the heavens collapsed and the Numinous Palace collapsed. “To be honest, I don’t understand the situation anymore.”
 Jing Tiangong looked ashamed. Han Jue said, “You don’t have to worry. Think of a way to avoid the calamity. The Jie School won’t die. You have two Heavenly Dao Sages.”
 Jing Tiangong asked in surprise, “Two Heavenly Dao Sages?”
 “Sage Jin’an is also from the Jie School.”
 “What?”
 Jing Tiangong was shocked. He clearly did not know about this.
 Han Jue said meaningfully, “It’s fine as long as you know about this.”
