 Walking on Pangu’s path? Han Jue raised his eyebrows and asked, “He has the strength to do so?” Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du shook his head. “My master said that he holds the Heaven-Opening Axe and has a 36th-grade Chaotic Green Lotus on his head. Be it attack or defense, even a Great Dao Sage will find it difficult to resist.”
 So ridiculous?
 Han Jue suddenly thought of the Heaven-Opening Axe the system had given him.
 However, his Heaven-Opening Axe was not that strong. He had tried it in the simulation trial. Although it was his strongest offensive Dharma treasure, it was completely useless against Ancestor Xitian. Moreover, why were there two Heaven-Opening Axes?
 Han Jue was puzzled. Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “We have to hurry up and increase the providence of the Heavenly Dao. Now that the Heavenly Race has moved to the netherworld, they are not suitable to be the Heavenly Dao Race anymore. Which race do you think is suitable?”
 Han Jue said, “The Human Race.”
 “Alright, I’ll listen to Fellow Daoist Han and choose the Human Race as the new Heavenly Dao Race,” Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du replied with a serious expression. Han Jue complained in his heart, What are you pretending for? Don’t you also want the Human Race to become the Heavenly Dao Race?
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du was from the Human Race and was the Sect Master of the Human School. How could he not support the Human Race?
 Then, Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du chatted about the Reincarnation Space. Just like before, he talked about the Reincarnation Space’s development.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du planned to develop the Reincarnation Space into another Little Heavenly Dao or even into a mortal world in the Heavenly Dao.
 Han Jue had no objections. Half of the Reincarnation Space belonged to him, anyway. Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du wanted to use this to fight for providence, but it couldn’t affect Han Jue.
 If the two of them really fell out one day, Han Jue would let him know who the master of the Heavenly Dao was. After chatting, Han Jue returned to the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 His gaze landed on Han Yu.
 This fellow had also participated in the battle of the netherworld and his cultivation level had increased greatly. Now, his status in the Human Race was only inferior to the Human Emperor. He even called the Human Emperor his brother.
 Once the humans returned as the Heavenly Dao Race, Han Yu would have made a comeback.
 Han Jue looked at the netherworld again. Under the domineering orders of the Heavenly Calamity Emperor, the Calamity Race didn’t dare to deal with ghosts, gods, and immortals. Empress Houtu and Ji Xianshen naturally wouldn’t take advantage of this. The netherworld returned to its former peace.
 “Peace is still the best. Everyone, cultivate in peace.”
 Han Jue thought silently. As long as he was given time, he would be more arrogant than anyone else when he was truly invincible!
 Dark Forbidden Zone.
 A huge bronze ship sailed. There was no living being on the huge ship, but the ship was clean. It did not look like it was uninhabited. In front of the bronze ship, Han Tuo and Yi Tian appeared. Yi Tian frowned and asked, “That’s it? Why is there nothing?”
 Han Tuo said, “It’s precisely because there’s nothing that it’s here. There are probably countless Inauspicious Evils on the ship who want to devour us.” At the mention of the Inauspicious Evil, Yi Tian couldn’t help but shiver.
 Anyone would be afraid of such an invisible existence.
 Han Tuo flew forward and cupped his hands. “I’m Divine General Han under the Evil Heavenly Emperor. I’m here to seek an audience with the Inauspicious Divine Emperor!” Yi Tian bowed.
 The bronze ship suddenly stopped. The surrounding dark space fluctuated like water blown by the wind. A hoarse voice came from the bronze ship, “Where’s your emperor?” Han Tuo replied, “His Majesty is looking for the Divine Jade of the Ruins of End for you.” The Inauspicious Divine Emperor did not reply. Han Tuo braced himself and continued, “His Majesty asked us to invite you to capture Divine Lord Peacock. He said that as long as you can do it, he will think of a way to gather three pieces of Divine Jade of the Ruins of End for you and let your race control the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End’s sky.”
 An extreme killing intent attacked. Han Tuo’s face instantly turned pale. Behind him, Yi Tian also took out his Dharma treasure and prepared to fight.
 Yi Tian was extremely nervous. He didn’t even know where the Inauspicious Divine Emperor was.
 “Hmph, lead the way!” “Thank you, senior!”
 Han Tuo heaved a sigh of relief and immediately turned around to lead the way.
 Yi Tian followed beside him and asked with a voice transmission, “What is the Divine Jade of the Ruins of End? This old fellow is actually willing to agree.”
CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m “Don’t talk nonsense. You have to be respectful to your senior. As for the Divine Jade of the Ruins of End, His Majesty told me that if someone obtains it, they can obtain the providence of the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End and even control it. A long time ago, the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End was actually a Supreme Treasure.” “What? Supreme Treasure? There’s such a huge Supreme Treasure?” “I heard that, too. Ask His Majesty yourself when you return.”
 “Tsk tsk.”
 Time passed. In the blink of an eye, three thousand years passed. In the past three thousand years, the Immortal World had changed drastically. The thing most worth mentioning was the rise of the Human Race. The Human School, the Chan School, the Jie School, the Buddhist Sect, the Divine Palace, the Holy Mother Sect, the Loose Heaven Sect, and so on had all entered the Human Race and spread the Dao techniques to help them rise quickly. The reproduction ability of the Human Race was already powerful. Now that they had the support of the Sage Sects, they could be said to have soared into the sky.
 The numerous races of the Immortal World were nervous. They were not stupid. They could tell that the Sages wanted to support the humans again. However, in the past, they often bullied them. They were worried that the humans would take revenge on them after they rose.
 The happiest was none other than the Dragon Race. Long Hao had face, and all the elders of the Dragon Race admired him. If not for Long Hao, the Dragon Race would also be one of the mortal enemies of the Human Race.
 Apart from that, there were dozens of mortal worlds between the netherworld and the Immortal world.
 At the edge of the Immortal World, the disciples of the various sects were still building various Chaotic Cities to help the providence of the Heavenly Dao spread and condense into a land that bordered the Immortal World. This process was very complicated and required a long time to accumulate. However, in the Immortal World, there was no lack of time.
 The Calamity Race did not stay. Under the arrangements of the Heavenly Calamity Emperor, more and more Calamity Race living beings reincarnated and helped the Calamity Race integrate into the Heavenly Dao.
 The reincarnated living beings of the Calamity Race also headed to the edge of the Immortal World or the mortal world to help the Heavenly Dao expand. The Calamity Race’s performance satisfied the Sages. At least from the looks of it, the Calamity Race really wanted to join the Heavenly Dao. In short, the entire Immortal World was thriving.
 On this day.
 The Strange Deity suddenly found Han Jue. It was very emotional. Through telepathy, Han Jue knew that this fellow was very terrified as if he had encountered his natural enemy. “You’re saying that an extremely powerful Inauspicious Deity is approaching the Heavenly Dao?”
 As Han Jue became stronger, the Strange Deity that had long fused with him also became stronger. Although it was far inferior to him, in terms of strength, it was already equivalent to a Sage. Its perception could naturally cover the Heavenly Dao.
 The Strange Deity nodded, extremely nervous. Han Jue looked up. It was silent outside the Heavenly Dao. There was nothing unusual. However, it was very difficult to see the Inauspicious Evil.
 Eh?
 Han Jue suddenly discovered that Divine Lord Peacock had disappeared. This fellow had always been in seclusion in the Calamity Race’s city. Could it be that he broke his promise?
 No!
 Han Jue immediately checked the emails.
 [Your good friend Divine Lord Peacock was attacked by an Inauspicious Evil) x90293021 (Your good friend Divine Lord Peacock was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure and was severely injured.]
 GaspHad he attacked the Inauspicious Evil’s base?
 Han Jue showed a frown.
 To be able to severely injure Divine Lord Peacock, the other party was at least an existence comparable to a Great Dao Sage. However, with so many Inauspicious Evils, they would definitely affect the Heavenly Dao living beings at the edge of the Heavenly Dao. Why was there no commotion? Could it be that the Inauspicious Evil was only targeting Divine Lord Peacock?
