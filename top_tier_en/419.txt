 Han Jue’s gaze pierced through the layers of chaotic clouds and saw a pair of eyes. These eyes were like the eyes of a human. They were extremely indifferent as if they had no emotions.
 Boom!
 Han Jue’s consciousness exploded. Unconsciously, he witnessed a huge battle. Countless terrifying figures rushed towards the largest and most majestic figure like moths to a flame.
 That majestic figure stood on the lotus throne and held a huge ax. A dazzling light shone above his head, and his divine might was vast. It made Han Jue shiver.
 What kind of spirit was this!
 It was indescribable.
 Han Jue didn’t see the end of this battle. When he came back to his senses, it was still the Chaotic Void, but the mighty figure in front of him was already gone. “The Heavenly Dao is like a dream. Everything is like a phantom. Mortal, jump out of this fabrication as soon as possible. Only then are you truly alive.”
 A vast voice sounded in Han Jue’s ears. It was air.
 Han Jue was stunned. What did he mean?
 Immediately after, this memory scene shattered. Han Jue realized that when he returned to reality, the Strange Deity was floating in front of him.
 Han Jue asked in his heart, “Who spoke just now?”
 (100 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?] A hundred billion years?
 Han Jue was shocked.
 With such a high cost, what kind of existence was he?
 He had to calculate!
 Continue!
 (The karma is too great. It involves a realm that the system cannot reach at the moment. It cannot be deduced. The price of lifespan will be refunded.]
 Eh?
 So ridiculous?
 Han Jue was shocked.
 The system could even deduce the Dao Ancestor. Was this fellow even more powerful than him?
 Could it really be the Giant God Pangu?
 Han Jue asked, “Currently, other than the Hidden Sect, who knows my exact location?”
 (A billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?)
 Continue!
 (Not exposed for the time being. ]
 Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief. That was good.
 To prevent any accidents, he still controlled Hidden Sect Island to move away from this place.
 An hour later.
 He stopped and looked at the Strange Deity.
 Why could the Strange Deity bring him such a memory?
Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m Could the previous scene be the Chaotic Fiendcelestial War during the Chaotic Era?
 The Strange Deity seemed to have forgotten what had happened and began to wander around again.
 Han Jue thought for a while and continued cultivating.
 To put it bluntly, his cultivation realm was too low and he could not see through everything.
 Immortal World, beside the Heavenly River.
 Fang Liang stood above the clouds with his hands behind his back. He had a dignified expression. Beside him stood an immortal who looked identical to him.
 After so many years, Fang Liang had completely become the Heavenly Emperor. His eyes were dignified and he was extremely shrewd.
 The Divine General suddenly appeared beside him. He glanced at the Immortal God beside Fang Liang and looked at him. He cupped his fists and said, “Your Majesty, the Jiang family of the Human School has chosen to support the human race. Jiang Dugu has returned. He brought the Primordial Yuan Phoenix and devoured a hundred thousand Heavenly Troops. The Heavenly Court has suffered heavy losses.”
 Fang Liang narrowed his eyes and asked, “Does Li Daokong know about Jiang Dugu?”
 The Divine General replied, “Li Daokong has already gone to fight him.”
 Fang Liang fell into deep thought.
 After a long time.
 Fang Liang said, “Send the immortals to the extreme north to invite the Fang family.”
 Fang Clan?
 The Divine General was stunned and asked in surprise, “Are you related to the Fang family?”
 Fang Liang nodded slightly.
 The Divine General was secretly shocked. So the Heavenly Emperor chose Fang Liang because of this.
 He immediately accepted the order and left.
 Fang Liang turned to look at the Immortal God beside him and muttered, “This battle will depend on your divine power.”
 This Immortal God who looked identical to Fang Liang did not change his expression. He was like a puppet.
 Time passed quickly. Twenty years passed quickly.
 Han Jue took out the Book of Misfortune again and cursed Jade Emperor Zhou Yan. At the same time, he checked his emails.
 [Your good friend Jiang Dugu has joined the human race. His providence has transformed.]
 (Your good friend Zhou Fan was attacked by a human cultivator] x170098
 [Your good friend Ji Xianshen was attacked by human cultivators] x390221
 (Your good friend Pan Xin has joined the human race. His providence has transformed.] (Your good friend Jiang Dugu was attacked by your good friend Li Daokong.]
 (Your good friend Han Ming was attacked by your good friend Pan Xin and was severely injured.)
 (Your good friend Mo Fuchou was attacked by your good friend Pan Xin and was severely injured.]
 Jiang Dugu and Pan Xin joined the human race?
 Very powerful!
 Looking down, Pan Xin clearly used a huge move and severely injured Han Jue’s friends.
 Why would this coward enter the calamity?
 They were all taking sides!
 Han Jue was very curious about the battle in the Immortal World. “I want to know, which race will win this calamity?” Han Jue asked silently in his heart.
 (5 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [Heavenly Court)
 Han Jue’s eyelids twitched. Would the humans be wiped out?
 Han Jue felt that his morals had been shattered. His subconscious still treated him as a human, so he always felt that the human race would definitely survive. Han Jue asked, “What will happen to the human race?”
 [They will be extinct. All living beings born as humans must die, including the human immortals.]
 This time, his lifespan was not deducted. It should be related to the previous deduction.
 Extinction…
 Including all the human immortals!
 Han Jue frowned. What was going on? “Will I die after the calamity ends?” [A billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [Not for the time being.)
 Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief. It seemed that only the humans in the Immortal World would die.
 What should he do now?
 Han Jue decided to visit Xing Hongxuan in her dreams and tell her to return.
 He immediately used his Mystical Power and pulled Xing Hongxuan into the dream.
 Above the clouds, the two met.
 Xing Hongxuan didn’t look good and didn’t pounce on him.
 Han Jue frowned. What happened? Could it be that it was inconvenient for Xing Hongxuan to enter the dreams now?
 A figure appeared beside Xing Hongxuan. It was a woman who looked identical to Dao Comprehension Sword.
 Tai Sutian!
 Crap!
 I screwed up!
 The next time he visited, he had to deduce the other party’s situation.
 Han Jue cursed himself for being careless. Tai Sutian stared at Han Jue and said, “Please save the humans!”
 Save the human race?
 Han Jue said helplessly, “The human race needs me to save them?” Tai Sutian replied, “Yes. Six of the nine Heavenly Dao Sages chose to support the Heavenly Court and eradicate the human race. Only Sage Nüwa and Sage Fuxi chose to protect the human race. Heavenly Emperor Fang of the Heavenly Court is your grand-disciple. Although your karma is small, you are closely related to many people facing the calamity. Perhaps you can reverse the situation.”
 Han Jue said, “But my cultivation isn’t good enough.”
 “I heard from the Sages that you are at least at the Deity Realm.”
 Hearing this, Han Jue secretly felt that something was wrong. Sage Nüwa was staring at him.
 The human race was a deep pit. Han Jue didn’t want to enter rashly. Even if he helped the human race, he couldn’t help openly lest he provoked great karma.
 Tai Sutian continued, “If the humans can survive this calamity, the Sages will give you a huge opportunity that contains the method to attain the Dao!” Dao attainment method!
 What was attaining the Dao?
 Wasn’t it to become a Sage!
 Han Jue asked in surprise, “Aren’t there only nine Sages?”
 Tai Sutian replied, “Sage Nüwa will give up her position as a Heavenly Dao Sage.”
