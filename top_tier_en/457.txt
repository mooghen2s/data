 “Hmph, how impudent!”
 Ma Chao roared angrily and immediately rushed into the spatial vortex.
 A sneer sounded. “Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal? No wonder there’s such a barrier. However, it’s not enough. I want this place!”
 His words made the Hidden Sect disciples nervous.
 After hiding on Hidden Sect Island for so long, they were all a little timid.
 At this moment, Zhao Yun suddenly stepped into the spatial vortex.
 In less than three breaths of time.
 “How can this be! Who are you?”
 “Fellow Daoist! I was wrong! I’ll leave immediately!”
 Hearing this, everyone from the Hidden Sect heaved a sigh of relief and laughed.
 The Black Hell Chicken cursed. “That’s it? You gave me goosebumps!”
 The Chaotic Heavenly Dog shouted, “Senior Zhao Yun is impressive. He will be my big brother from now on!”
 The others also discussed.
 Zhao Yun carried a white-haired man out of the spatial vortex. Ma Chao followed closely behind.
 The white-haired man curled up as if he was tied up by an invisible rope as Zhao Yun threw him onto the tree trunk.
 On the other side. Han Jue used the simulation trial to test this person’s cultivation.
 (Wu Dao: Perfected Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm, Human Loose Cultivator]
 Eh?
 No powerful background?
 Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief.
 Wu Dao was able to suppress Ma Chao, who had Zu Tu’s cultivation, with extraordinary strength. After all, Zu Tu was the strongest in the calamity of the Immortal World, equivalent to the strongest Zenith Heaven cultivator.
 What should he do?
 He definitely couldn’t let this guy go, or the spatial vortex might expose his location.
 Han Jue sent a voice transmission to Zhao Yun.
 Zhao Yun looked down at Wu Dao with killing intent in his eyes, scaring him so much that he quickly shouted.
 “Senior, I was wrong! I was also being hunted down and had no choice. Let me go and I definitely won’t return!
 “It’s fine if you don’t let me go. I’m willing to be a slave. Don’t kill me!”
 The higher his cultivation level, the more he cherished his life. Wu Dao didn’t seem to have left any life-preservation means elsewhere. He was extremely afraid.
 Zhao Yun carried Wu Dao into the Connate Cave Abode and returned to the Fusang Tree alone.
 The disciples were not worried about Han Jue. Instead, they started to discuss if Wu Dao could survive.
 Li Yao said, “It’s best to kill him to prevent future trouble.”
 Chu Shiren frowned. “You’re so evil.”
 Dao Comprehension Sword snorted. “Wasn’t that fellow very arrogant just now? If we can’t defeat him, do you think he will let us live?”
 “He didn’t say that he wanted to kill us!”
 “It’s just that he didn’t get a chance.”
 “It’s not good to kill too many people. Over time, you will have no regard for life and death.”
 Seeing that the three of them were about to quarrel, the Black Hell Demon Lord smiled and said, “Perhaps he will survive. After all, I was beaten into submission.”
 Zhao Xuanyuan said proudly, “I’m different. I have good judgment and took the initiative to come.”
 He had already joined the Hidden Sect for a period of time. Every time Zhao Xuanyuan thought of the past, he couldn’t help but sigh.
 This was the best decision he had ever made in his life!
 In the past, he had always listened to the arrangements of his elders and rarely made decisions himself.
 Leaving the Human Race and becoming Han Jue’s disciple was definitely the most important decision in his life as the number one prodigy of the Human Race.
 On the other side.
 Inside the Connate Cave Abode.
 Han Jue stared at Wu Dao and asked, “How’s the situation in the Chiliocosm World? Who are you being hunted down by?”
 Wu Dao replied nervously, “Recently, the Chiliocosm World has been in chaos. The various providence sects have been fighting non-stop. The Sages have never appeared. I’m being hunted by my enemies.
 “I really know my mistake. Let me go.”
 Han Jue asked, “If I let you go, will you hate me?”
 “How can this be!”
 (Wu Dao has developed hatred towards you. Current Hatred Points: 3 stars]
 Wu Dao cursed in his heart. How could he not hate them?
 He was also a famous mighty figure in the Chiliocosm World. At his peak, a million disciples had listened to him preach the Dao. If not for his current state…
 The more he thought about it, the more his heart ached.
 Han Jue sighed and directly sucked Wu Dao into the world of stars before killing him.
 Wu Dao didn’t even have time to react. He had just appeared in the world of stars when he was killed by a punch from the Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial Dharma idol. His body and soul were destroyed.
 “Unfortunately, you’re not kind enough. You came to find trouble and I wanted to let you go. Shouldn’t you be grateful to me?”
 Han Jue thought expressionlessly.
 The current Hidden Sect no longer needed to absorb experts. Instead of absorbing unstable foreign experts, it was better to nurture them from the inside.
 Apart from his disciples, the ten thousand Nether Race members also had great potential.
 Ever since Empress Houtu entrusted the Nether Race to him, they treated Han Jue as their Father. They even established stone statues that worshiped him in their territory. Currently, the Nether Race and the Hidden Sect had yet to completely fuse, but they would occasionally interact. The Black Hell Chicken and the Chaotic Heavenly Dog liked to play with them the most.
 Then, Han Jue closed his eyes and continued cultivating
 He didn’t move Hidden Sect Island. After all, the spatial vortex was located at the end of the Chiliocosm World and could not be moved.
 Several months later.
 Since Wu Dao did not walk out of the cave abode, the disciples knew that he was gone.
 The Black Hell Demon Lord guessed that Wu Dao must have felt hatred and was detected by Han Jue.
 He had interacted with Duan Hongchen before and felt that Han Jue had the ability to see through people’s inner thoughts. His guess convinced the others.
 Han Jue would never slaughter the innocent, but once he was threatened, he would definitely not show mercy.
 Chu Shiren didn’t say much. He didn’t believe others, but he believed Han Jue’s judgment.
 Ever since they followed Han Jue, they no longer encountered any danger. They could cultivate in peace every day. This was even safer than the Buddhist Sect.
 Under the sky filled with rolling thunderclouds, the ground was stained with blood. The mountains and rivers were broken as if they had been bombed by a terrifying force. No place was intact.
 Su Qi leaned against a huge broken stone gasping and staring at the sky.
 Countless living beings gathered in the sky and the ground, surrounding him. Looking up, there were human cultivators, demons, dragons, Vermilion Birds, Qilin, and so on in all directions.
 All the living beings looked at him with killing intent, hatred, and anger.
 Su Qi had fought for the Heavenly Court for so many years. His bad luck had spread to almost every corner of the Immortal World. He had offended too many enemies.
 Now that the Heavenly Court had been defeated and was preparing to retreat, Su Qi became the target of everyone’s anger. “Su Qi, you can’t escape! The immortals won’t save you!”
 A human cultivator laughed angrily. His voice resounded through the world, causing the other living beings to curse out loud. All sorts of ugly words entered his ears.
𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com Su Qi wasn’t angry. Instead, he smiled.
 “You want to find me for revenge? But do you remember how many sins you have committed? Sin is sin. It doesn’t matter how big or small it is. I, Su Qi, have done it. I admit it. But if you want to kill me, just attack. Stop talking nonsense and stop trying to comfort the uneasiness in your hearts!”
 Su Qi flew up as he spoke. The aura of misfortune overflowed and surrounded him.
 This scene frightened the living beings so much that they retreated, not daring to be the first to attack him.
 Boom! Boom! Boom…
 The ground shook violently as terrifying footsteps came from the horizon. Everyone turned their heads and saw a 30km tall figure walking over.
 “Su Qi, you slaughtered my race. Today, I will definitely destroy your soul!”
 A furious roar exploded.
 Su Qi frowned, feeling the pressure.
 At this moment, a voice sounded in his ears.
 “Do you want to end everything? As long as you are willing to use your Mystical Power, the calamity will end. The living beings who survived will be grateful to you. You can even obtain Heavenly Dao Merit because you stopped the endless calamity.”
