 “Thank you for your understanding, Empress. I will definitely choose a good person who cares about all living beings to inherit the position of Sage.”
 Han Jue cupped his fists and said sincerely.
 Nüwa chuckled and said, “That’s all for now. In the future, there will be no Nüwa in the Heavenly Dao. You still have to rely on yourself. I can’t interfere in the matters of the Heavenly Dao. It’s against the Great Dao.”
 Han Jue nodded, “I understand. I don’t dare to trouble you, Empress.”
 Nüwa waved her sleeve and the dream shattered.
 Han Jue’s consciousness returned to reality.
 He exhaled.
 Sages were really good at this. Their schemes were deeper and deeper. Who could have expected that Nüwa would not really die? Even the Sages didn’t know! “No matter what, at least I didn’t take on the Heavenly Dao Sage position or offend her. This is considered a success.”
 Han Jue thought silently. So far, he hadn’t offended any of them. Sage Fated Secrets was different since the one who had offended him was the Dark Forbidden Lord. What had this got to do with him?
 Han Jue sighed and didn’t know what to say.
 Everything was arranged. He even obtained the Sage position. What Han Jue wanted to do now was to continue cultivating and strive to be invincible below the Sages before entering the Immortal World. But it was fine even if he couldn’t. Even Sages couldn’t break in if he stayed in the Dao Field.
 Wait.
 He had to be cautious.
 “Can the array formation of the Dao Field completely block the invasion of a Heavenly Dao Sage?” Han Jue asked in his mind.
 (Unable to stop the invasion of many Heavenly Dao Sages]
 Han Jue’s eyelids twitched.
 It was still unsafe.
 It seemed that before the Dao Field upgraded again, he still could not provoke Sages. He had to be polite and cautious towards them.
 Han Jue shook his head and laughed. He continued cultivating.

𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com Nüwa’s death made all the living beings in the Heavenly Dao even crazier. After all the living beings knew that even Sages were not eternal, they became more and more daring. They all wanted to fight for providence in the calamity and even become Dao Sages!
 The war between the Heavenly Court and the humans had already stopped, but the various factions who supported them had indeed begun to fight madly. Those who had grudges would take revenge, and those who did not would snatch resources. For a time, the Immortal World was even more chaotic.
 Instantly, more and more factions surfaced, and more mighty figures became famous.
 As for the Heavenly Race, there was no sign of them for the time being.
 The Dark Forbidden Zone also began to become restless.
 Forty-five years later, Hidden Sect Island was attacked by another Inauspicious Deity.
 Han Jue directly let it in and let Zhao Yun deal with it.
 Zhao Yun was the new guard, a replica of Shi Dudao!
 This was also Zhao Yun’s first battle. With a raise of his hand, the Inauspicious Deity was directly suppressed on the beach and could not move. The Hidden Sect disciples were dumbfounded.
 This new guard was stronger than Lü Bu and Ma Chao!
 After Zhao Yun suppressed the Inauspicious Deity, the Strange Deity immediately devoured it and became stronger again. The Hidden Sect disciples couldn’t see the Strange Deity. They thought that Zhao Yun’s Mystical Power had destroyed the Inauspicious Deity’s body and soul.
 After dealing with the Inauspicious Deity, Zhao Yun returned to the Fusang Tree expressionlessly and guarded the spatial vortex.
 Shi Dudao’s appearance was not as domineering as Zu Tu’s. He was even slightly thin and weak, but his eyes were extremely cold and sharp, making people not dare to look at him.
 On the other side. In the Connate Cave Abode, Han Jue looked worried.
 This time, the Inauspicious Deity seemed to be even stronger than the one from before. At this rate, the Dark Forbidden Zone would really be filled by Inauspicious Deities.
 If an Inauspicious Deity beyond the Heavenly Dao Sage level appeared one day, it would not be good.
 Han Jue moved Hidden Sect Island again. It would be bad if there was a connection between the Inauspicious Deities.
 Several days later, Hidden Sect Island stopped. Han Jue continued cultivating and charged towards the perfected Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm.
 In the Immortal World, at the edge of the endless sea, at a cliff that stretched across the sea, as if isolating the sea here.
 Two figures stood on the cliff.
 They were Zhou Fan and Su Qi.
 Zhou Fan was dressed in black and wore a wyrm black jade crown. He held a huge cauldron in one hand and looked murderous.
 Su Qi was also dressed in black, but his hair was disheveled and his eyes were dark. Strange symbols crawled over his forehead.
 The two of them looked at each other and did not move for a long time.
 Zhou Fan slowly said, “I didn’t expect my final opponent to be you.”
 Su Qi said, “I didn’t expect so many people from the tiny Scarlet Cloud World to face the calamity.”
 “What would Han Jue think if he knew that we were fighting?”
 “He might sigh, but it won’t affect his Dao heart. Our conflict might be child’s play in his eyes.”
 “That’s true. He should be charging into the Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm now.”
 “Of course. My master’s potential is unparalleled.”
 “Unparalleled in the world? Do you know the Chaotic Physique?”.
 “I know. Aren’t you the same?”
 “Haha.”
 Zhou Fan laughed wantonly. Yellow Qi flowed out of the cauldron and into his body. His aura began to increase.
 Su Qi’s robes fluttered as the aura of misfortune erupted.
 Zhou Fan needed immeasurable merit to continue defying the heavens.
 Su Qi needed great providence to cleanse his bad luck.
 The two of them didn’t want to avoid this battle. They weren’t close to each other, anyway. They only knew Han Jue. It wasn’t enough for them to give up chasing each other.
 Ten years later.
 Han Jue took out the Book of Misfortune and cursed Sage Fated Secrets. At the same time, he habitually checked his emails.
 (Your good friend Heavenly Emperor was expelled by your good friend Qiu Xilai and entered the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End.]
 (Your good friend Tai Sutian has received guidance from a Sage. Her cultivation has increased greatly.] (Your good friend Huang Zuntian has joined the Heavenly Race and his providence has transformed.]
 (Your good friend Zhou Fan was attacked by your disciple Su Qi and was severely injured.)
 [Your disciple Su Qi was attacked by your good friend Zhou Fan and was severely injured.]
 (Your good friend Mo Zhu received guidance from a Sage and learned an Immeasurable Cultivation Technique.]
 (Your good friend Li Daokong was attacked by your good friend Jiang Dugu.]
 Seeing the Heavenly Emperor’s situation, Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief. Qiu Xilai had indeed fulfilled his promise. However, would it be dangerous for the Heavenly Emperor to go to the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End?
 He had to calculate before dreaming.
 Han Jue noticed that Mo Zhu had finally made a move. Previously, he had learned that Mo Zhu had been taken in as a disciple by the Sect Master of the Human School, which meant that she had been taken in by Li Muyi. Now that she had learned the Immeasurable cultivation technique, it was also a good opportunity.
 If not for Li Muyi wanting to rope Han Jue in, Mo Zhu would have died in the Immortal World.
 Han Jue hoped that this beauty would live well, but he didn’t take it to heart.
 Back then, he had already asked her to stay, but she insisted on leaving. In that case, she had to be responsible for her choice.
 Time could erase everything and prove everything
 Five days later.
 Han Jue put down the Book of Misfortune and asked in his mind, “Is there a Sage beside the Heavenly Emperor?”
 (2 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 (Yes]
 Han Jue was depressed. Why was there more?
 Could it be that he had been following the Heavenly Emperor?
 Forget it, he would visit him in the future.
 Han Jue prepared to continue cultivating.
 At this moment, he suddenly felt a powerful aura.
 It came from the Fusang Tree!
 Space-time vortex!
 At the same time, on the Fusang Tree, Zhao Yun and Ma Chao stood up at the same time and blocked the space-time vortex. A pair of cold eyes appeared in the vortex.
 “I didn’t expect to accidentally discover a space-time barrier. It’s just nice for me to set up a Dao Field!”
 A cold laugh came from the spatial vortex.
