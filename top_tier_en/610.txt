 The Sages’ Mystical Powers landed on the floating island almost instantly. Black light quickly expanded from the island and isolated all the Mystical Powers before it was destroyed.
 The Dark Sage King raised his hand and made a grabbing gesture. Countless Dharma treasures suddenly flew out from the darkness like a torrential storm and swept towards the Sages.
 Qiu Xilai sat on the golden lotus and transformed into a hundred million feet tall golden Buddha. His arms drew a circle, and ten million arms appeared. He waved his palm in all directions. The wind stirred by the power of the Sages made the Evil Heavenly Emperor on the island unable to withstand it. Even with the Dark Sage King’s protection, he still felt that he could turn into dust at any time.
 Emperor Xiao transformed into his demonic body. His long hair fluttered wildly. He held a crimson spear and directly entered the island. He held the spear and attacked the Dark Sage King.
 Sect Master Tian Jue took out four magic swords and formed a sword formation that hung high above the floating island.
 South Extreme Heavenly Venerate cast spells with both hands and kept chanting. Golden halos descended from the sky and suppressed the floating island.
 Heavenly Venerate Wufa attacked. He held his sword and kept scattering sword Qi, wanting to break through the black light protecting the floating island.
 A river appeared above Fuxitian’s head. Roaring figures flew out and pounced at the floating island.
 Han Jue used his Mystical Power, Unparalleled Sword Qi. Countless Sword Qi interwove together and emitted a dazzling sword light that forcefully shattered the black light.
 “Yes?”
 The Dark Sage King’s gaze landed on Han Jue, clearly surprised.
 He was clearly a Heavenly Dao Sage. Why could he break through his Dharmic powers?
Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m Could it be that the reason why these Sages dared to come again was because of this person?
 After the black light shattered, the floating island appeared. The Sages continued to use their Mystical Powers.
 The Dark Sage King fought the Sages alone. He destroyed the Sages’ Mystical Powers with his right hand and pulled out a huge lightning whip from the darkness with his left hand to lash at them.
 Caught off guard, South Extreme Heavenly Venerate was the first to be struck. His body exploded and his Sage Soul was also severely injured. Fortunately, he was a Heavenly Dao Sage and quickly condensed his body. The entire process happened in the blink of an eye.
 Emperor Xiao’s body was wrapped in demonic Qi as he charged in front of the Dark Sage King. His long spear stabbed out and thousands of spear shadows burst forth, piercing through the Dark Sage King and piercing into the depths of the darkness.
 “You’re far inferior to the Devil Ancestor and Luo Hou!” the Dark Sage King said disdainfully and pointed at him
 Boom
 Emperor Xiao felt as if he had been struck by an invisible force. He couldn’t help but retreat. A black hole appeared behind him and devoured him before shrinking.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du raised his sword. The Taiji Painting rose behind him. Black and white light circled and quickly mixed into a ball. Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du split into two clones.
 “Three Pure Ones!”
 The Dark Sage King was moved. He immediately waved his sleeve and moved the Evil Heavenly Emperor out.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor quickly left the floating island and looked at the Sage Battlefield that was getting further and further away.
 At the same time, in the Dark Falling Prison, all the prisoners were shocked by the battle in the projection.
 The speed of a Sage was too fast. All sorts of Mystical Powers were at his fingertips. Even Han Tuo and Yi Tian, who were at the Deity Realm, were dazzled.
 Even through space, that terrifying holy might made them tremble in fear.
 “Is this a Sage?”
 “Do you see? The Sage of our Chan School has come to save us!” “Hehe, isn’t our Human Race’s Sage also here?”
 “Isn’t Fuxitian a Sage of our Demon Race? How can he be a Human Race Sage!”
 “Looks like we have a chance to be saved!”
 The prisoners became excited and the Dark Falling Prison became noisy.
 Han Jue’s Supreme Treasure descended on the floating island with the Dark Sage King’s Dharmic powers. He walked towards the Dark Sage King and shrank the ground into an inch. He took two steps and arrived in front of him, slashing down with his sword.
 The Dark Sage King raised his hand to block, but the barrier formed by his Dharmic powers was easily broken.
 Emperor Xiao, who had just freed himself from the black hole, attacked again. He said anxiously, “Fellow Daoist Han, I’m counting on you!” He transformed into a black beam of light. With the spear tip in front, he attacked with unstoppable force. The Dark Sage King leaped and easily dodged.
 The Dark Sage King raised his arms and muttered something. Thunderclouds appeared above the floating island and countless black lightning descended on Han Jue and Emperor
 Xiao.
 Suppressed, Han Jue placed his arms above his head, looking like he couldn’t withstand it.
 Emperor Xiao was even worse. He was suppressed to the ground by the black lightning. The lightning transformed into shackles and locked him down.
 The Dark Sage King smiled disdainfully.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du, South Extreme Heavenly Venerate, Qiu Xilai, Heavenly Venerate Wufa, Sect Master Tian Jue, and Fuxitian continued to attack.
 This was the battle of the Sages. It was difficult to defeat them in a short period of time. Even if the Dark Sage King suppressed the Heavenly Dao Sage, he couldn’t easily kill him.
 The Sages were under a lot of pressure. They didn’t expect Han Jue to be unable to withstand the Dark Sage King.
 Now, they could only fight.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du’s Three Pure Ones formed two extremely powerful Dharma Idols. They quickly arrived in front of the Dark Sage King and were destroyed by their swords no matter what Mystical Power he used.
 “This is Laozi’s Dharma idol...”
 The Dark Sage King’s eyes narrowed as he was occupied by madness.
 “Hmph, even with the help of an Ancient Sage, all of you will die today!” the Dark Sage King shouted domineeringly. A terrifying wind stirred around him and destroyed Laozi’s Dharma idol.
 Turning to look at Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du and standing proudly, he smiled and said, “Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du, you’re stronger than before. However, I wasn’t serious earlier. Next, I’ll let you see my great Mystical Power. All of you can stay and submit to me!”
 He laughed impudently. Terrifying power surged from the darkness in all directions and entered the Dark Sage King’s body.
 Emperor Xiao threw his spear, but it was blocked by the dark power. The Sages were moved. They all felt that the Dark Sage King’s power was increasing steadily.
 At this moment!
 Han Jue suddenly appeared behind the Dark Sage King. The two Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols above his head waved their palms at him. Imprisonment Fiendcelestial!
 Barrier Fiendcelestial!
 The power of two Fiendcelestials stopped the Dark Sage King. This time, Han Jue used his full strength.
 The Dark Sage King was shocked. “How is this possible!”
 The power of the Barrier Fiendcelestial directly severed his connection with the darkness and forcefully interrupted his speed of becoming stronger.
 Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols quickly condensed above Han Jue’s head.
 Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial!
 Strength Fiendcelestial!
 Combat Fiendcelestial!
 Unbeatable Fiendcelestial! Giant Fiendcelestial!
 Dozens of Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols entered Han Jue’s body as soon as they appeared. He also waved his palm.
 Primordial Divine Rage!
 It could combine the power of many Fiendcelestials and fuse them together to form a powerful Mystical Power!
 After breaking through to the Freedom Sage Realm, the number of Fiendcelestials Han Jue could fuse increased greatly. He fused with Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols that had powerful physical strength.
 With a palm strike, the Dark Sage King was instantly annihilated.
 [The Dark Sage King has developed hatred towards you. Current Hatred Points: 6 stars]
 Han Jue ignored the notification and waved his palm again. Before his body condensed, he destroyed the soul of the Dark Sage King.
 “No,”
 The Dark Sage King roared hoarsely, his tone filled with fear.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor, who was leaving the battlefield, only felt the dark power wrapped around him disappear. Hearing the Dark Sage King’s voice, his expression changed drastically.
 “How is that possible... The Sages killed the Dark Sage King?”
