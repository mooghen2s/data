 Li Xuan’ao seemed to have thought of something as his eyes lit up.
 Li Daokong snorted. “We’re no longer disciples of the Human School. You are not allowed to attack them. Even without your master, do you think the Human School will disperse?”
 Li Xuan’ao frowned.
 Li Daokong shook his head. “Junior, your vision is still too narrow. A providence sect is not as simple as you think. Otherwise, why would the Buddhist Sect and the Jie School always revive and reorganize after scattering?”
 Li Xuan’ao frowned even more.
 Li Daokong ignored him and walked out of the hall. He faced the east and bowed slightly.
 He was a Pseudo-Sage and had already sensed that Li Muyi’s karma with him had been severed. This meant that he was really dead.
 No matter how they had conflicted in the past, without Li Muyi, Li Daokong would not be here today.
 Li Daokong could only bow. He couldn’t kill Han Jue for Li Muyi.
 When Li Muyi hunted him down, only Han Jue was willing to take him in in the entire Immortal World.
 “The world is changing,” Li Daokong muttered to himself as he narrowed his eyes.
 He seemed to see the 33rd Heaven in chaos.
 Two thousand years passed.
 [Primordial Heavenly Prison has successfully enslaved the target.]
 (Qiu Xilai has a favorable impression of you. Current favorability: Max.]
 Han Jue opened his eyes and smiled in satisfaction.
 He stared at him.
 Qiu Xilai seemed to have a dream. He opened his eyes and looked at Han Jue. He hurriedly stood up and bowed. Recalling the past, he was filled with guilt. “Sorry. For some reason, I actually… Sigh!”
 Han Jue smiled. “It’s all in the past. Is the Heavenly Dao Spirit still around?”
 In the process of enslaving Qiu Xilai, he also gave him an Absolute Purification, but it was unknown if he had destroyed the Heavenly Dao Spirit.
 Qiu Xilai replied, “The Heavenly Dao Insignia in my body has already been removed, but the Heavenly Dao Spirit is still there. I have never been able to capture it.”
 Han Jue frowned. In that case, the Heavenly Dao Spirit was still his great enemy.
 “If the Heavenly Dao Spirit still comes to find you, act according to the situation. Don’t directly expose our relationship,” Han Jue said seriously.
 Qiu Xilai nodded.
 Then, Han Jue moved him to the 33rd Heaven and asked Zhang Jue to leave.
 Seeing that Qiu Xilai returned to the Dao Field, the other Sages came looking for him.
 “Han Jue let you go?”
 “I thought you were dead. Since you’re alive, what about Li Muyi?”
 “Tsk tsk, you actually survived. What a pity.”
 “Is what Han Jue said true? You really found Luo Hou?”
 Facing the Sages’ questions, Qiu Xilai’s expression was calm.
 He sighed and said, “Fellow Daoist Li Muyi is already dead. It’s all my fault for finding him to scheme against Han Jue. What Han Jue said is true. We indeed found Luo Hou. This is our fault. The reason why Han Jue let me go is that I protected his disciple in the previous calamity. I will be grounded and reflect on myself.”
 With that, he turned around and returned to his Dao Field.
 The other Sages looked at each other and did not speak for a long time.
 Was Qiu Xilai giving in?
 They knew him too well. This was extraordinary. What method did Han Jue use?
 On the other side.
 A line of words appeared in front of Han Jue.
Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com (Cundi has developed hatred towards you. Current Hatred Points: 4 stars]
 Cundi!
 What a familiar name!
 Han Jue immediately checked his interpersonal relationships.
 (Cundi: Great Dao Sage, Immeasurable Emperor, founder of the Buddhist Sect. Because you severed his karma with Qiu Xilai, he has developed hatred towards you. Current Hatred Points: 4 stars]
 Jade Bodhi was the Primordial Ancestor of the Buddhist Sect and Cundi was the founder. What was the relationship between the two?
 Han Jue had heard of Cundi on Earth before. It was the Sect Master of the Western World, which was also the Buddhist Sect.
 Those legends should be the projections of the Sages’ heavens. They might not be true, but there were clues.
 Han Jue didn’t panic at all. The Dao Field’s array formation had already been raised to the Great Dao Sage Realm. It could even block the prying of a Great Dao Supreme. It was extremely stable.
 Why didn’t Li Muyi’s backing develop hatred towards Han Jue?
 Could it be that he was too heartless?
 Han Jue stopped thinking and continued cultivating
 He couldn’t cultivate in peace for the past two thousand years. Even with Zhang Jue around, he was afraid that Qiu Xilai would suddenly escape.
 He should cultivate well next.
 Han Jue was already addicted to cultivating. If he didn’t enter seclusion for a period of time, he would feel uncomfortable all over.
 Under the Fusang Tree.
 The disciples cultivated separately. Dao Comprehension Sword opened her eyes and complained, “You always rely on brute force!” Tu Ling’er smiled proudly. “I’m from the Magus Race. I have the bloodline of the Ancestral Magus. Breaking all techniques with brute force is the inheritance of our Magus Race!”
 The two women had just experienced a simulation trial when Dao Comprehension Sword was defeated again.
 Dao Comprehension Sword was about to speak when the Fusang Tree suddenly shook violently, startling the disciples under the tree.
 The Black Hell Chicken asked, “What’s wrong with you?”
 The Fusang Tree replied, “The Chiliocosm World I connected to is gone. The spatial tunnel has also closed.”
 The Chiliocosm World was gone?
 Long Hao asked, “Should I tell Master?”
 The Black Hell Chicken glared at him and said angrily, “Does the Chiliocosm World belong to Master? Don’t disturb Master’s cultivation if there’s nothing.”
 It looked at the Fusang Tree and said, “Has this affected you?”
 “No… I was just shocked.”
 “Stop making a fuss. I think you’re a woman.”
 “What do you mean?”
 The Black Hell Chicken was about to explain when it suddenly felt the gazes of Li Yao, Dao Comprehension Sword, Tu Ling’er, and Xiao Er. Frightened, it hurriedly shut up.
 This small incident didn’t affect Han Jue.
 Under the white clouds in the sky, the mountains rose and fell. Mountain ranges were like the ridges of dragons crawling on the ground. Some strange mountains and forests were magnificent. Rows of flying beasts circled above the forest, and the roars of ferocious beasts and demon beasts came from time to time.
 At the top of a straight mountain was a Daoist temple.
 The Daoist temple was very simple. Colorful flowers were planted beside it.
 At this moment, a middle-aged man was kneeling in front of the Daoist temple. “Father, the Han family really needs your help. You’ve never helped us. Do you really want the Han family to be wiped out?”
 The middle-aged man cried in grievance.
 The door to the Daoist temple suddenly opened.
 Han Tuo slowly walked out. He was still so young. Compared to the middle-aged man, he was more like a son.
 Seeing Han Tuo come out, the middle-aged man crawled forward excitedly.
 Han Tuo frowned, his eyes filled with disappointment.
 He was too disappointed in his son. He always came to trouble him.
 He had traveled the world alone and reached his current realm.
 Han Tuo said, “I’ll help you one last time. Choose a disciple from the family and I’ll impart my cultivation technique to him. From now on, I’ll leave this world. You can rely on yourselves in the future.”
 Hearing this, the middle-aged man was moved and asked carefully, “Where are you going? Can you bring the Han family along?”.
 Han Tuo snorted. “What Han family? You created it for your own selfish desires. You’re far inferior to your younger sister. That’s all. Don’t force me to change my mind.”
