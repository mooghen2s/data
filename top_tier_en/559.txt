 Sect Master Tian Jue stared at him without saying anything.
 The hall fell silent.
 After a long while…
 Sect Master Tian Jue said faintly, “Huang Zuntian, do you want to become a Sage?”
 Huang Zuntian’s eyelids twitched as he said, “Of course. But I want to protect the Jie School more. Without the Jie School, I wouldn’t be where I am today.”
 Sect Master Tian Jue said, “The various providence sects will compete for the new Sage position. You are the only one qualified in the Jie School. I will pave the way for you. What you have to do is to strengthen the Jie School and increase its providence.”
 Huang Zuntian frowned. “Where’s Jing Tiangong?”
 Sect Master Tian Jue snorted. “He has already betrayed us. His heart is with the Dark Forbidden Lord. Otherwise, why would he pass it on to you?”
 Huang Zuntian was silent.
 “That’s settled. In ten thousand years, I want more than a hundred million disciples and more than five hundred Deity Realm cultivators!” Sect Master Tian Jue snorted.
 Huang Zuntian cursed silently. He was really asking for too much.
 The Deity Realm was not so easy to nurture!
 However, facing a Sage, Huang Zuntian did not dare to say no.
 After leaving the Sage Dao Field, Huang Zuntian flew down to the 33rd Heaven. He couldn’t help but think of the Hidden Sect.
 Sigh.
 When will Master summon me back?
 The Hidden Sect is already so strong. Why do you still want me to hide?
 Could it be that he had even greater ambitions?
 Huang Zuntian did not dare to continue thinking. If he did, he would probably be discovered by the Sages.
 He had to forget about this first!
 Time passed.
 More than eight hundred years went by.
 [Detected that you are 50,000 years old and your life has taken another step forward. You have the following choices:]
 (1: Exit seclusion immediately and control the Heavenly Dao alone. You can obtain a Mystical Power inheritance, a Great Dao Fragment, and a Supreme Treasure.]
 [2: Cultivate in a low-profile manner and pursue surpassing the Heavenly Dao. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment and a Pseudo-Sage Dao Field guard.]
 Han Jue opened his eyes and smiled.
 Finally!
 Han Jue directly chose the second option.
 (You choose to cultivate in a low-profile manner and pursue surpassing the Heavenly Dao. You will obtain a Great Dao Fragment and a Pseudo-Sage Dao Field guard.]
 Han Jue finally accumulated nine Great Dao Fragments.
 A Pseudo-Sage Dao Field guard was also not bad.
 This time, Han Jue planned to duplicate the Three Pure Sacred Ancestor.
 The Three Pure Sacred Ancestor had already submitted to him. In addition, the simulation trial had his data, so there was no problem in choosing him.
 (Beginning to duplicate the Dao Field guard]
 Han Jue took out the nine Great Dao fragments and fused them.
 He had already planned for the new Great Dao comprehension.
 He wanted to create a Great Dao Mystical Power that could completely fuse the Grand Unity Aspect.
 After the nine Great Dao fragments fused, a strong light burst out and drowned Han Jue’s figure. He entered the Great Dao comprehension state.
 Immortal World, an island.
 A white-haired youth sat at the top of the mountain, facing the east. His body was surrounded by a visible wind.
 A beam of light descended from the sky and landed in front of him.
 Tian opened one eye and saw a ruddy old Daoist.
 The old Daoist smiled and said, “Tian, if you want to cultivate, you have to seek the Dao. Why don’t you acknowledge me as your
 master?”
 Tian replied, “I already have a complete name. It’s called Yi Tian. As for a master, I don’t need one.”
 Yi Tian?
 The old Daoist pondered for a moment and did not understand the meaning of this name.
 “If you don’t acknowledge me as your master, you can only cultivate by instinct. When can you walk out of the endless sea?”
 “Who said that I rely on my instincts to cultivate?”
 Yi Tian looked disdainful.
 Without waiting for the old Daoist to continue asking, Yi Tian said impatiently, “Leave quickly. If you come again, don’t blame me for being impolite!”
 The old Daoist frowned. “Why are you so stubborn?”
 Yi Tian stood up immediately, his expression quickly becoming sinister. His white hair stretched out and turned into thousands of venomous snakes. His thin body began to expand his muscles and his aura suddenly changed. The murderous soaring aura caused the sky to change and thunderclouds to gather.
 Moved, the old Daoist immediately disappeared.
 Yi Tian’s expression softened, and he returned to his original appearance. He looked harmless.
 This was not the first cultivator he had chased away.
 He was annoyed. Why was there always someone coming to take him in as a disciple?
 He was born with cultivation techniques and Mystical Powers. He didn’t need to acknowledge anyone as his master!
 A thousand years had passed since he was born. His cultivation level had already reached the Rank Nine Immortal Emperor Realm. More than a hundred islands in the area had submitted to him.
 He enjoyed this life and did not want to leave this sea.
 At this moment, a three-headed eagle flew over and landed in front of him. It said respectfully, “Your Majesty, a person appeared in the north and floated on the sea. His aura is powerful, and he can’t wake up. Our subordinates can’t bite him at all.”
 Hearing this, Yi Tian became interested and immediately jumped over to check.
 Tens of thousands of kilometers away, countless birds circled the sea. There were also many sea lifeforms that had yet to transform leaping out of the sea.
 In the middle of them floated a man covered in blood.
 It was Han Tuo.
 He was severely injured. White bones could be seen at his joints.
 Yi Tian quickly rushed over, scaring the surrounding living beings away.
 He frowned as his gaze landed on Han Tuo.
 For some reason, Han Tuo’s aura made him feel inexplicably close.
 He felt as if he had encountered his own kind.
 He raised his hand and waved. Han Tuo left the sea and landed in his hand.
 He carried him and left, disappearing into the horizon in the blink of an eye.
 In the Daoist temple of the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 Han Jue suddenly opened his eyes. His eyes shone brightly and his aura was oppressive.
 “This Mystical Power is called the Primordial Divine Rage. It combines the power of many Fiendcelestials when it’s mastered. It forms the strongest Mystical Power and can destroy the enemy in one strike!” Han Jue muttered to himself as a line of words appeared in front of him.
 [Congratulations on creating the Great Dao Mystical Power-Primordial Divine Rage]
 Han Jue checked the attributes list. Forty-nine years had passed.
 Seven times seven was forty-nine. Somehow, the number seven was predestined.
Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m Han Jue began the simulation trial and tested the Primordial Divine Rage.
 Against Li Muyi, insta-kill!
 Against Qiu Xilai, insta-kill!
 Against the South Extreme Heavenly Venerate, insta-kill!
 Sage Fated Secrets was insta-killed!
 He didn’t insta-kill Heavenly Venerate Wufa, but Han Jue was no longer passive. He had the upper hand.
 Han Jue challenged Ancestor Xitian next.
 The Primordial Divine Rage attacked Ancestor Xitian without causing any damage.
 In the simulation trials, Han Jue became more proficient in using the Primordial Divine Rage.
 No one at the Sage Realm could withstand it!
 Even if it was a Heavenly Dao Sage, the Primordial Divine Rage could sever the providence of the Heavenly Dao in one strike and send the other party to their death!
 Han Jue was very satisfied.
 During this period of time, the Dao Field guard had already been copied. He stayed in the corner of the Daoist temple waiting for Han Jue’s instructions.
 “From now on, your name is Cao Cao. Go outside and cultivate,” Han Jue said.
 Cao Cao immediately bowed and left respectfully.
 Han Jue’s Three Kingdoms army expanded again.
 In a good mood, he checked the emails.
 Soon, he frowned because of an email.
 (Your son Han Tuo was attacked by the Dark Sage King and was severely injured.]
