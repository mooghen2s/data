 It was fine to let Long Hao out. Han Jue happened to have an arrangement. “After you go out, think of a way to unite the Dragon Race. Can you do it?” Han Jue asked. The Dragon Race had risen again and had already become a force that couldn’t be underestimated in the Immortal World.
 Long Hao was pleasantly surprised and immediately accepted the order. He didn’t have the confidence to come and ask this time. He didn’t expect Han Jue to really agree. That day, Long Hao was sent out by Han Jue. The reason why he agreed was because of the Evil Heavenly Emperor. Now that the Sages had announced the Heavenly Dao’s independence, the Immortal World also needed more geniuses to show their support. Han Jue hoped that the Hidden Sect disciples could occupy a large portion. After Long Hao left, the other disciples did not follow suit. Han Jue called Su Qi over. Su Qi bowed respectfully. His cultivation had already reached the perfected Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm and even surpassed Dao Sovereign. The Chaotic Fiendcelestial’s bloodline was not something that the Chaotic Physique could compare to. “How have you been cultivating recently?” Han Jue asked. Su Qi replied, “Not bad. Thank you for your help, Master. You let me enjoy a top-notch aptitude experience.”
 Han Jue asked, “Do you have the urge to go out?”
 Su Qi had already grasped bad luck. He would no longer bring bad luck wherever he went like before.
 While Su Qi had yet to rise, Han Jue wanted him to fuse into the Heavenly Dao. Otherwise, even if Su Qi attained the Dao in the future, he wouldn’t be able to enter the Heavenly Dao.
 In this life, Su Qi had always been in the Dao Field and had never entered the Heavenly Dao. Han Jue had obtained a lot of Heavenly Dao merit before he attained the Dao. Hearing this, Su Qi said carefully, “If Master doesn’t let me out, I won’t go out.” Han Jue smiled. “Then, do you want to go out?” Su Qi was silent, not knowing how to answer.
 He had committed grave sins and did not dare to go out again.
 “It’s fine to go out. You can help all living beings and make up for your sins.” Han Jue smiled. After Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage was chased away, the Heavenly Dao next was considered united. They wouldn’t scheme more than before.
 After all, Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du and the other Sages had already announced that they would break up with the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End. It was impossible for spies to act like this.
 Su Qi hurriedly said, “I’ll follow Master’s instructions!”
 Han Jue immediately waved his sleeve and brought Su Qi to the 33rd Heaven, landing in front of the Universal Hall.
 The door to the Universal Hall opened and the master and disciple walked inside. Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du looked at Su Qi with a strange expression.
 This aura…
 Chaotic Fiendcelestial! Han Jue came in front of him and said, “The Heavenly Dao and the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End are about to become enemies. If the Heavenly Dao wants to stay stable for a long time, it will definitely need to support its juniors. This is my disciple, Su Qi. You should have heard of his past. Now that he has been reborn, he was lucky to obtain the Chaotic Fiendcelestial bloodline. I want him to fuse with the Heavenly Dao. Think of how he can atone for the previous calamity.” Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du looked at Su Qi deeply. He didn’t ask where the Chaotic Fiendcelestial bloodline came from. If the Heavenly Dao wanted to become stronger, it had to rely on Han Jue.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said in a low voice, “He has the aura of death on him. Why don’t we confer him the title of Heavenly God of Death and let him control the dead in the world? He can be sent into the cycle of reincarnation to restrain Empress Houtu. The netherworld is the furthest from the Heavenly Dao. Empress Houtu has often left the Heavenly Dao recently. I have my doubts.”
 He was very calm when facing Han Jue.
 Han Jue said, “Sure. I’ll leave this matter to you. You can contact the other Sages.”
 “Yes, I’ll give my merit to your disciple and let him fuse into the Heavenly Dao.”
 “Thank you.”
 “You’re welcome, Fellow Daoist Han.” Han Jue looked at Su Qi and said, “Stay here and wait for this senior to make arrangements for you.”
 Su Qi hurriedly bowed.
 Han Jue disappeared. This was the first time Su Qi saw Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du. He was very nervous because the people who opened the Dao Field here were all Sages. Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du revealed a rare smile. “Don’t be nervous. I’ll tell you about the recent changes and let you understand the situation of the Heavenly Dao.”
𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com Su Qi nodded.
 After returning to the Hundred Peak Immortal River, a line of words appeared in front of Han Jue.
 (Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du’s favorability towards you has increased. Current favorability: 6.5 stars]
 Another 6.5 stars! How sensible. Han Jue’s favorability towards Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du also increased.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du never plotted against Han Jue behind his back. He had the courage to face invincible enemies and even had his own principles and pursuits. Han Jue was still very satisfied to cooperate with such a Sage. In the next few days, the other Sages’ favorability toward Han Jue increased one after another. It was probably because of Su Qi. The Sages knew very well what a Chaotic Fiendcelestial meant. Although they didn’t understand how Han Jue obtained the Chaotic Fiendcelestial bloodline for Su Qi, there was one more Chaotic Fiendcelestial in the Heavenly Dao, and there would definitely be another safeguard in the future.
 A year later. Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du’s voice resounded through the myriad worlds. “From today onwards, Hidden Sect disciple Su Qi will be conferred the title of Heavenly God of Death. He will control the order of the dead and guard the netherworld. This is the arrangement of the Sages and the Heavenly Dao. All living beings can worship the new Heavenly God of Death.” Everyone was in an uproar. Heavenly God of Death! Another Hidden Sect disciple! How many mighty figures were hidden in the Hidden Sect? Netherworld.
 Yang Tiandong, who was dealing with the ghosts, was stunned. He smiled and muttered, “Junior Su Qi…”
 He thought that Su Qi’s arrival was Han Jue’s arrangement and that he was sent to protect him.
 Recently, the netherworld had indeed been a little chaotic. Some mysterious and unknown existences attacked the ghost servants from time to time. He had also been attacked and still didn’t know the other party’s true appearance. That day, Su Qi descended into the netherworld. The gods and ghost servants of the netherworld went to receive him. With his cultivation at the perfected Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm, Su Qi quickly convinced the crowd. He met Yang Tiandong and chatted with him, making the other Kings of Hell realize that they were on the same side. There were many Kings of Hell in the netherworld. All of them had their own forces and fought openly and secretly. Su Qi’s arrival meant that Yang Tiandong was about to rise.
 Inside the Daoist temple. Han Jue had just started cultivating when a notification suddenly appeared in front of him. [Empress Houtu sent you a dream. Do you accept?] Han Jue remained silent. He was on good terms with Empress Houtu. The matter of Su Qi had indeed oppressed her. She was probably here to question him.
 After hesitating for a moment, Han Jue still chose to accept the dream.
 In the dream, the two of them appeared by the Yellow Spring Empress Houtu stared at him and asked, “There’s something wrong with Su Qi’s aura. He has already become a Chaotic Fiendcelestial?” Han Jue said, “That’s right. I accidentally obtained a Fiendcelestial body in the Dark Forbidden Zone.” Empress Houtu said meaningfully, “Snatching the Chaotic Fiendcelestial bloodline is something that even the mighty figures of the Primordial Era can’t do. Han Jue, who are you? Are you also a Chaotic Fiendcelestial?”
 Han Jue said, “Oh, you found out.”
 “Is the Dao Ancestor still alive? Is he supporting you from behind?” Empress Houtu changed the topic. Han Jue remained silent. Empress Houtu was enlightened. “I see. I will support Su Qi. The Six Paths of Reincarnation belong to the Heavenly Dao. The Heavenly Dao is formed by my father, Pangu. I will also do my best to protect the Heavenly Dao. You don’t have to worry that I will betray you. I left the Heavenly Dao because I was summoned by my brothers.”
