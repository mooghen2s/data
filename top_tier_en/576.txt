 The father and son chatted for a while more before the middle-aged man left and went back to choose a suitable disciple. Han Tuo looked at his departing figure and sighed.
 Every time he saw his children, Han Tuo would always think of his late wife. The reason why he came to the mortal world to get married and have children was only to train and for his state of mind to become clearer.
 His previous wife in the Immortal World had died in the hands of the enemy, while the wife of the mortal world had died of old age.
 Han Tuo had thought that their life would be simple. He didn’t expect his children to want to pursue the Immortal Dao like him.
 At first, Han Tuo still had expectations for his children. However, his son had taken a different path and was filled with desire for power. Instead, his daughter had been pursuing the Dao calmly.
 Han Tuo suddenly thought of his father.
 What did Han Jue think of him back then?
 Thinking of Han Jue’s words, he was a little confused.
 Could it be that he was really not a qualified father?
 “Father, if you were still alive, perhaps… Sigh, it’s all my fault for not finding the immortality pill for you in time,” Han Tuo muttered to himself. He shook his head and stopped thinking about it. After staying in the mortal world for so long, it was time to return.
 Half a month later.
 The middle-aged man brought a youth up the mountain. Han Tuo let the youth enter the Daoist temple. The youth knelt on the ground respectfully. Although he was only 13 or 14 years old, his bearing was very stable.
 For some reason, Han Tuo inexplicably thought of his younger self.
 He really looked like him.
 Han Tuo began to teach him the Dao technique.
 Three hundred years passed.
 Han Jue opened his eyes. He had finally relaxed in the past three hundred years, and his mood had finally become happy.
 He stood up and decided to preach the Dao for the Hidden Sect.
 It had been thousands of years since he had preached the Dao. It was time.
 “Prepare to listen to the Dao.”
Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m Han Jue’s voice resounded throughout the Hundred Peak Immortal River. All the disciples came out of seclusion.
 He still preached the Great Dao of Extreme Origin for a hundred years.
 A hundred years later, Han Jue stopped preaching and looked down at the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 After so many years, some new prodigies still appeared in the Hidden Sect. Most of the personal disciples also took in disciples. Even the Black Hell Chicken.
 Han Jue predicted that after a hundred thousand years, other than the Nether Race, at least five thousand Deity Realm experts would appear in the Hidden Sect.
 If a hundred Zenith Heaven Golden Immortals appeared in ten million years, there should be hope!
 There might not even be a hundred Zenith Heaven Golden Immortals in the entire Immortal World, so it could be imagined how powerful the Hidden Sect would be ten million years later.
 However…
 Ten million years was too long!
 Han Jue was still charging towards 100,000 years.
 Sometimes, having good potential would also cause trouble, but one would find that time was too slow.
 After speaking, Han Jue returned to the Daoist temple.
 He opened the emails and checked them. He didn’t read them for a long time and did not know how his friends were doing.
 (Your good friend Evil Heavenly Emperor was suppressed by your enemy Cundi and was severely injured.]
 [Your son Han Tuo accidentally entered the Nine Nether Purgatory.]
 (Your good friend Li Daokong was attacked by your good friend Jiang Dugu) (Your good friend Shi Dudao was attacked by your good friend Li Daokong.]
 (Your good friend Evil Heavenly Emperor has received guidance from a mysterious mighty figure. His cultivation has increased greatly.]
 (Your good friend Jing Tiangong created the Darkness Sect.]
 (Your good friend Emperor Xiao was cursed by a mysterious curse.]
 How could the Evil Heavenly Emperor provoke Cundi?
 Han Jue was puzzled. Most importantly, the Evil Heavenly Emperor could still survive.
 Did he hesitate to kill the Evil Heavenly Emperor?
 He could test the waters. In any case, Cundi was his enemy. Furthermore, it had been hundreds of years since he had enslaved Qiu Xilai.
 Han Jue continued reading. This was not the first time Jing Tiangong established the Darkness Sect.
 After leaving the Jie School, he seemed to be having a rough time.
 Han Jue hesitated to directly recruit Jing Tiangong
 Forget it.
 If he needed the identity of the Dark Forbidden Lord in the future, he could not expose it in advance.
 Han Jue looked down. Most of his good friends outside began to become active. The former Immortal World had completely returned.
 After closing the emails, Han Jue extended his Sage Sense and observed the entire Immortal World.
 The three regions near the Hundred Peak Immortal River were already densely covered in living beings. Most of the living beings were in the form of humans after transforming. However, the humans lived very hard in the Immortal World and had already become a small race. They could only survive in a region divided by the Heavenly Race.
 Apart from the demons, the strongest race in the current Immortal World should be the Famous Race. They were acting like the demons. They proclaimed that all living beings in the world with a certain amount of fame could enter the Famous Race.
 The demons were now led by the Heavenly Race and did not dare to anger them. They were fighting with the Famous Race for the throne.
 From then on, the Dragon Race had risen again.
 Perhaps because of the Sage position, more and more mighty figures traveled the world and spread their Dao techniques. More than a hundred providence sects were born. Almost every providence sect had a Divine Realm mighty figure or even a Pseudo-Sage.
 Han Jue observed for several hours before retracting his gaze.
 He looked at the mortal world that Han Tuo had stayed in. The Han family that Han Tuo had left behind had already migrated and were still being hunted down. It was a little desolate.
 “This brat is really heartless. He’s really like his father,” Han Jue muttered to himself.
 Although the Han family’s situation was tragic, it was not to the extent of being wiped out. There were many disciples in the family whose potential surpassed mortals, but they were too young and did not have time to grow.
 With a thought, Han Jue moved the Han family to a safe forest and isolated them from the world. He hoped that they wouldn’t cause trouble and cultivated in peace.
 Then, he closed his eyes and continued cultivating
 Outside the 33rd Heaven.
 Qiu Xilai, Heavenly Venerate Wufa, South Extreme Heavenly Venerate, Fuxitian, Sect Master Tian Jue, Emperor Xiao, and Empress Houtu gathered in Li Muyi’s Dao Field.
 The Sages were nervous as they looked at a light hole floating in the air. Lightning silently flickered, dazzling and strange.
 Empress Houtu couldn’t help but ask, “Who will come?”
 Sect Master Tian Jue said calmly, “I’m not sure. If the Grand Supreme Sage didn’t take in a new disciple in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End, that senior should have come.”
 Empress Houtu frowned.
 The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate looked at Qiu Xilai and asked, “Why are you so calm? Li Muyi died because of you!” “If he had no intention, how could he agree to my plan? I can’t force him.” Qiu Xilai shook his head.
 Sect Master Tian Jue snorted.
 The other Sages also could not stand Qiu Xilai.
 This fellow was really shameless.
 At this moment, a vast pressure spread out from the cave.
 A white-haired gray-robed elder walked out. He held a horsetail whisk, and a long sword that emitted a green light floated behind him. At the end of the sword hilt was a small lotus throne.
 Apart from Empress Houtu and Fuxitian, the other Sages bowed and said in unison, “Greetings, Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du!”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du’s expression was indifferent as he said, “I already know about the Heavenly Dao’s situation. The Grand Supreme Sage asked me to control the Human School. I hope that you won’t make things difficult for the Human School in the future.”
 “Of course,” the Sages replied again.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du looked at Qiu Xilai and asked, “Why did you sever your karma with that person?”
 Qiu Xilai replied, “I was caught by Han Jue. I had no choice. My heart is still with the Buddhist Sect.”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du’s eyes suddenly filled with deep meaning, as if he was seeing through him.
