 The only thing he looked forward to now was the successful upgrade of the Dao Field.
 It had been a year, and it had yet to succeed. However, as long as he could raise the Dao Field array formation to the level of a Heavenly Dao Sage, so what if he waited for another hundred years?
 Not long after, Hidden Sect Island fell silent again.
 Eight years later.
 [The Dao Field has been upgraded. The array formation has been upgraded to the Heavenly Dao Sage level. It has expanded the internal space of the Dao Field.]
 [Dao Field Immortal Qi has increased by ten times. Connate Qi has increased by five times.]
 [The Dao Field can block the prying of Great Dao existences.] [The system has added a new guard position. You can completely duplicate a Pseudo-Sage expert in the simulation trial as a guard. He will listen to you. The guard cannot leave the Dao Field for more than an hour. Otherwise, he will directly melt.]
 Heavenly Dao Sage level!
 Han Jue was pleasantly surprised.
 Finally!
 Not only that, but it could also block the prying of Great Dao existences!
 He was completely confident! At least below the Heavenly Dao, Han Jue was very stable.
 The new guard could be chosen from a Pseudo-Sage expert!
 Han Jue asked silently, “Who is the strongest among the Pseudo-Sages in the Great Ultimate Hall?”
 There were many listeners in the Great Ultimate Hall. Most of them had never interacted with Han Jue, so he had never seen them in the emails.
 As for the simulation trial, there were a few Pseudo-Sages. Han Jue couldn’t defeat them no matter what, so he didn’t know who was stronger.
 [2 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 A figure appeared in Han Jue’s mind, and a line of words appeared in front of him.
 (Shi Dudao: Perfected Pseudo-Sage Realm, Immeasurable Emperor, Great Dao Inheritor]
 Han Jue remembered this fellow. He had grasped a strange and domineering Mystical Power. Once Han Jue’s Dharmic powers approached him, they automatically dissipated. The Mystical Power hit him and disappeared.
 Previously, Han Jue felt that Shi Dudao was very strong. He didn’t expect that he was really the strongest Pseudo-Sage!
 He was equivalent to the number one person below the Sages!
 Han Jue immediately chose Shi Dudao as the third guard.
 (Beginning to duplicate the guard) Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief. He felt that his future was bright.
 His Dao Field had already become a Sage’s Dao Field. Even if a Sage came to attack, he might not succeed. At the very least, he could stall for time.
 He no longer had to worry about being spied on by Great Dao Sages.
 In addition to Shi Dudao, Han Jue could use an hour to make the guard his killing weapon.
 Han Jue was very excited just thinking about it.
 At this moment…
 [Empress Nüwa sent you a dream. Do you accept it?]
 Eh?
 Wasn’t Nüwa dead?
 Han Jue was stunned.
 Was she acting again?
 Han Jue asked in his mind, “If I accept Nüwa’s dream, will I be in danger?”
 (30 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Thirty billion years?
 This was ten times the value of a Heavenly Dao Sage!
 Han Jue suddenly recalled that Tai Sutian had barged into his and Xing Hongxuan’s dreams. She had mentioned that Nüwa was about to jump out of the Heavenly Dao Sage position and wanted Han Jue to inherit the position.
 Could it be…
 Continue!
 Han Jue gritted his teeth and chose.
 [The Dao Field can block the prying of Great Dao existences. In the dream, the Great Dao Sage can’t kill you.]
 Alright!
 It just so happened that the Dao Field had been upgraded.
 Han Jue chose to accept Nüwa’s dream.
 Immediately after, he entered the dream.
 This was a green mountain and river. There was a huge waterfall between the two peaks that looked like a galaxy. Nüwa stood by the river. She was like a legend. She had a human body and a snake tail. She wore a colorful lotus dress and had a dignified posture. Her perfect face revealed a gentle smile as she waved at him.
 Han Jue was stunned for a moment. He didn’t walk up but asked cautiously, “You are?”
 Nüwa smiled and said, “Nüwa, have you heard of me?”
 “Sage!”
 Han Jue hurriedly bowed. Nüwa stared at him and smiled. “Han Jue, it’s really difficult to visit your dreams.” Han Jue asked in surprise, “You’ve also tried before? Why did I only feel it now? Is it because I’m in the Dark Forbidden Zone?”.
 Nüwa smiled. “Perhaps, but it’s not important. Have you heard about my death?” Han Jue replied truthfully, “I’ve heard the Sages mention it.”
 Nüwa smiled and said, “They can’t wait anymore.”
 Han Jue had many thoughts.
 Was this a plot by the Sages, or was Nüwa tricking them?
 “I could have long transcended the Heavenly Dao and stepped into the Great Dao. I’ve only been looking for a successor, hoping that a benevolent person would inherit my position as the Heavenly Dao Sage. In this calamity, the ambitions of the Sages were exposed. I took this opportunity to escape from the Heavenly Dao. The other Sages thought that I had really perished, but that’s not the case. Don’t tell anyone about this.” Nüwa smiled.
CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m Han Jue said carefully, “Even if I don’t say it, won’t the Sages know?”
 Nüwa replied, “The Heavenly Dao no longer has any traces of me. The Sages are conceited and only believe in themselves. Who knows how many living beings in the world believe that I’m not dead? How can all Sages believe that?”
 That was true…
 The difference in cultivation level made one’s understanding different.
 Han Jue took a deep breath and said, “Could it be that you want me to be a Heavenly Dao Sage? I don’t have such talent. Thank you for your kind intentions, Empress!”
 Why do all of them want me to be a Sage?
 “Sage Qiu Xilai and Sage Li Muyi came to find you only to rope you in as a puppet. I’m different. I’ve already surpassed the Heavenly Dao. Even if you become a Heavenly Dao Sage, it won’t do me any good. I only hope to leave a chance for the Heavenly Dao created by the Dao Ancestor. In this calamity, the Sages are in constant conflict, but they are actually putting on a show. Their goal is to destroy the providence of the Dao Ancestor’s Heavenly Dao and escape the Dao Ancestor’s constraints. “The Human Race is a Heavenly Dao Race established by the Dao Ancestor. They have also overthrown them. For their own benefits, they might do even more without a bottom line. I have to choose a person with a benevolent heart. You are suitable.
 “I’ve been observing you for a long time. Although you have little karma, you always do your best to protect the people around you. The Jade Pure Sacred Sect in the mortal world is not very helpful to you, but you have always been repaying their kindness. The Heavenly Emperor is the same. Although I don’t know what methods you used, the Heavenly Emperor’s calamity has been changing because of you. No other Heavenly Dao Sage can sense this.”
 Nüwa’s words made Han Jue’s heart shiver.
 She could even see through this?
 Ancestor Xitian also felt that Han Jue was changing fate. Could this be a Transcendent Dao Expert?
 Han Jue smiled bitterly and said, “I’m really afraid of trouble. I only want to cultivate and not fight with the Sages. How about this? I’ll choose someone among my disciples who meets your requirements.”
 Nüwa smiled and asked, “Han Jue, do you think Sages are child’s play?”
 Han Jue remained silent. However, he really did not dare to accept the position of Heavenly Dao Sage.
 “Forget it. If you want to become a Sage, you have to reach the Pseudo-Sage realm first. You still need Primordial Purple Qi. The Heavenly Dao has nine Primordial Purple Qi. My Primordial Purple Qi is left somewhere. The Heavenly Dao Sages are probably still looking for it. When the time is ripe, I will hand it to you.”
 Empress Nüwa’s words made Han Jue heave a sigh of relief.
 [Empress Nüwa has a favorable impression of you. Current favorability: 2 stars]
