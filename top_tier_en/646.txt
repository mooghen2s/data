 In the blink of an eye.
 Three hundred years passed.
 Han Jue had newly learned fifty Chaotic Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols. It took longer than before, mainly because the power of the Fiendcelestials conflicted with each other. The new Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols were respectively the Sheltered Rainbow Fiendcelestial, the Little Fiendcelestial, the Uninjured Fiendcelestial, the Heavenly Square Fiendcelestial, the Intentless Fiendcelestial, the Sole Sovereign Fiendcelestial, the Poverty Fiendcelestial, the Dao Gathering Fiendcelestial, the Fog Fiendcelestial, the Terror Fiendcelestial, the Great Affection Fiendcelestial, the Great Essence Fiendcelestial, the Twisted Fiendcelestial, the Eternal Night Fiendcelestial, the Primordial Martial Fiendcelestial, the Race Fiendcelestial, the Degree Fiendcelestial, the Avatar Fiendcelestial, the Ultimate Sorrow Fiendcelestial, the Spirit Ruler Fiendcelestial, the Soul Firmament Fiendcelestial, the Connate Loose Fiendcelestial, the Rotten Fiendcelestial, the Mutual Longing Fiendcelestial, the Skeleton Bone Fiendcelestial, the Golden Tablet Fiendcelestial, and the Ethereal Fiendcelestial.
 Most of these Fiendcelestial powers were a little special. For example, the Strongest Fiendcelestial was not the ‘strongest’ Fiendcelestial. This was a power that pursued the Strongest Great Dao. Once used, one’s strength would increase greatly and one would be instilled with the belief to pursue being the strongest. The stronger the opponent defeated, the stronger the Great Dao power. To Han Jue, this was not very good. He would easily lose his mind. He wouldn’t use it unless he was desperate. The Uninjured Fiendcelestial was an absolutely defensive Great Dao that couldn’t be harmed. It needed an even stronger Great Dao power to kill it in one strike.
 The Ultimate Sorrow Fiendcelestial had an extremely strong emotional resonance. It could absorb the sorrow of all living beings to make itself stronger.
 The Loose Gatherer Fiendcelestial could condense all true existences and also disband them into extremely tiny fragments. The Ten Thousand Creation Fiendcelestial was like the Fusang Tree. Its body grew ten thousand branches that could create a world and connect to an existing world. As long as the world he created existed, he wouldn’t die.
 Wait.
 Han Jue began the simulation trial and adapted to the new power of the Fiendcelestials. After ten years, he finally ended in satisfaction. At this moment, Sect Master Tian Jue was still in the Primordial Heavenly Prison. Han Jue looked at the Immortal World. After the Flame Race failed, the Immortal World returned to its previous state. Although all living beings cultivated harder, conflicts couldn’t be avoided. For example, if the Human Race wanted to rise, they needed to expand their territory and increase their resources. However, the nearby races were all once demons. The blood feud between humans and demons was engraved in their blood. Therefore, the Human Race was surrounded and fell into deep trouble again.
 Li Daokong was still not powerful enough. After the Flame Race’s calamity, all living beings understood one thing. Sages couldn’t personally interfere in the Immortal World!
 This fact subconsciously reduced their threat. Furthermore, with the various races joining forces, Sages couldn’t send mighty figures to capture them all in one go for the sake of the humans. It was not in line with the cultivation goal of the current Heavenly Dao.
 Because of this, Han Yu fell into various battles. His cultivation level increased very quickly. Han Jue didn’t pay attention to the humans for too long. It was fine as long as Han Yu was fine. If Han Yu could lead the Human Race to prosperity, Han Jue would change his opinion of him. He might even give him a huge opportunity to have the right to chase after his ancestor Han
 Tuo.
 Han Jue looked at the Holy Mother Sect next. It had developed very well. He didn’t know if it was because of Li Yao, but the number of female human disciples in the Holy Mother Sect increased and had already surpassed the female disciples of other races. Ever since the establishment of the Holy Mother Sect, they had been backed by the Jie School and had never encountered any trouble. Previously, when the Flame Race attacked, the battle had already ended when they had just arrived on the battlefield.
 Han Jue looked at the Reroll World below the Immortal World.
 Ever since he had released the Reroll World, it had developed alone. Now, it was only inferior to the first mortal world, the Loose Heaven World, and had become the second mortal world.
 Although Han Jue didn’t care about the Reroll World, the Heavenly Race, the Jie School, the Divine Palace, and the Holy Mother Sect all helped it. They even sent disciples to stay and preach the Dao to mortals.
 The current White-Robed Buddha had used the providence of the Reroll World to become a Zenith Heaven cultivator. He was also a famous figure.
 In the netherworld, Su Qi had been cultivating in seclusion, but because of him, Yang Tiandong’s status rose. The other Kings of Hell did not dare to offend him and followed him everywhere.
 Everything was fine.
 Han Jue suddenly noticed someone, an old friend.
 Mo Zhu.
 Back then, Li Muyi took in Mo Zhu as his disciple and wanted to scheme against Han Jue. However, before Li Muyi died, she had already returned to the Immortal World. As time passed, she and Han Jue had long become strangers. He usually couldn’t remember her.
 After all, Han Jue had asked Mo Zhu to stay. She insisted on leaving and wanted to make the Mo family famous. Time passed quickly. Mo Fuchou had died and the Mo Family was already in the past. The current Mo Zhu had already changed her name. Her name was Ancestor Fan Jue, and she was hidden in a corner of the Immortal World.
Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m This name was clearly derived from Han Jue’s.
 Mo Zhu was already at the Deity Realm, all thanks to the Human School’s Dao technique. Seeing Mo Zhu, Han Jue couldn’t help but recall the years in the mortal world.
 He sighed.
 Not long ago, he was still looking forward to the Immortal Realm.
 Han Jue didn’t look for Mo Zhu. She had already grown up and could protect herself. If she wanted to find him, she could just come to the Hidden Sect. Han Jue had calculated that Mo Zhu had met Zhou Fan. Zhou Fan didn’t hide Han Jue’s whereabouts, but Mo Zhu never returned. Why didn’t she return? She probably felt that she was unqualified. Everyone had their own ambitions. Be it Han Jue or Mo Zhu, they wouldn’t risk their lives for the so-called love.
 Han Jue sighed and entered cultivation again.
 Five hundred years later.
 [Primordial Heavenly Prison has successfully enslaved the target.)
 (Sect Master Tian Jue has a favorable impression of you. Current favorability: Max.] Han Jue immediately checked Sect Master Tian Jue’s profile picture from his interpersonal relationships. (Sect Master Tian Jue: Late-stage Heavenly Dao Sage, Sect Master of Jie School, Immeasurable Emperor. His favorability towards you is at the maximum.) Sect Master Tian Jue, who was meditating, opened his eyes and knelt down. Han Jue smiled. “There’s no need to be so polite. Our relationship will still be the same in the future, at least on the surface. Go back. If others ask, you know what to do.” Sect Master Tian Jue said respectfully, “I understand.”
 Han Jue waved his hand and sent him to the 33rd Heaven.
 Sect Master Tian Jue followed his memories and came to his Dao Field. At this moment, the South Extreme Heavenly Venerate appeared and followed him into the hall.
 After the door closed. The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate asked curiously, “Why was Han Jue looking for you?” Sect Master Tian Jue replied, “We chatted about the relationship between the Holy Mother Sect and the Jie School. It can be considered an alliance.” The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate clicked his tongue in wonder. “That works too. It seems that the Chan School should also establish a relationship with the Holy Mother Sect.” “Sure, the Heavenly Dao will take sides sooner or later. We have already severed ties with the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End. Why don’t you make an alliance with Fellow Daoist Han?” “That’s true. Tian Jue, I believe you. I’ll go prepare now.”
 “Mm.”
