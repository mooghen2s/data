 Why was this fellow looking for him?
 Han Jue had to use the derivation function to deduce.
 “I want to know why Dijun is looking for me.”
 (3 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 So many?
 This exceeded the cost of asking the outcome of the calamity!  Han Jue gritted his teeth and silently chose to continue.
 Immediately after, his consciousness entered the scene.
 This was a dark space. Boundless Chaotic Qi churned like clouds. A figure stood above the clouds. Beside him was a shadow that looked like a candle flame.
Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates It was Dijun.
 Dijun looked different from what Han Jue had imagined. His temperament was not oppressive, and he even looked gentle.
 He seemed to be thinking about something. He was silent and in a daze.
 The candlelight shadow suddenly spoke, “The other Sages have already made their move, why aren’t you moving?” Dijun said calmly, “Why should I move? I’m immortal. Even if the Great Dao Calamity comes, I’m not afraid.” “But if all the living beings who believe in you are gone, your cultivation will also be affected. Will the other Sages really not plot against?you?”
 The words of the candlelight made Dijun frown.
 After a while.
 Dijun said, “Previously, I found the Heavenly Court’s Divine General. Isn’t that enough?”
 “Not enough, because he’s from the Heavenly Court. The Heavenly Emperor himself is a?pawn.”
 “Then, I have another candidate.”
 Dijun smiled and started to pinch his fingers with his right hand. He used a Mystical Power.
 Before long, his expression darkened. He continued to pinch his fingers.
 The scene shattered. Han Jue’s consciousness returned to reality.
 Dijun wanted to use him as a pawn?
 Fortunately, he did not accept the dream! This fellow’s hand actually still reached into the Heavenly Court. The Heavenly Emperor was truly troubled internally and externally.
 Han Jue stopped thinking. It was fine as long as Dijun did not affect him.
 At the moment, Han Jue didn’t have the right to offend a Sage. If he could avoid provoking him, he would try his best not to provoke him. Even if he had to provoke him, he couldn’t let the other party discover him.
 After understanding the reason, Han Jue stopped thinking and focused on cultivating.
 Ever since the Chaotic Heavenly Dog became stronger, the other Hidden Sect disciples had been stimulated. They cultivated diligently, including Chu Shiren.
 This was a good thing.
 Due to the protection of the Dao Field, they would relax every once in a while.
 Seven years later.
 Li Yao came to visit Han Jue.
 She rarely took the initiative to look for Han Jue, which surprised him.
 After entering the cave abode, she knelt in front of Han Jue and said seriously, “Sect Master, I want to become stronger. I want to be as strong as you. Please teach me your Dao technique. I won’t betray the Hidden Sect in the future!”
 Her cultivation level had already reached the perfected Grand Unity Golden Immortal Realm, but she was still far from the Emperor Realm.
 In other words, her cultivation level had already reached the limit and could no longer increase.
 Han Jue said, “You want a cultivation technique?”
 Li Yao nodded and looked at him uneasily.
 Han Jue said, “Alright!”
 [Li Yao’s favorability towards you has increased. Current favorability: 6 stars]
 Han Jue was satisfied. It seemed that Li Yao was sincere in seeking Dao.
 Doesn’t this favorability allow me to do whatever I want?
 Han Jue said, “In that case, I’ll teach you our cultivation technique. This Dao is called the Primordial Chaos Reincarnation Great Dao. You can’t reveal it to a third person, including the others from the Hidden Sect.”
 Pleasantly surprised, Li Yao hurriedly promised.
 Anyone would be excited by such a different treatment.
 Han Jue taught Li Yao the Emperor chapter of the Primordial Chaos Reincarnation Great Dao. It was enough for her to cultivate to the Rank Nine Immortal Emperor Realm.
 If the Hidden Sect wanted to become stronger, they had to nurture their own disciples. Han Li couldn’t always rely on recruiting experts to make himself famous.
 He couldn’t completely trust the Black Hell Demon Lord, Diamond Rage, Duan Hongchen, and Jiang Yi. It was only because they had their own origins. But Li Yao was different. She had long severed her past and no longer had any karma.
 Li Yao began to comprehend the memories of the cultivation technique. Han Jue didn’t disturb her and continued cultivating.
 After five years, Li Yao finally woke up.
 She opened her eyes and saw Han Jue’s handsome and perfect face. Under the light of the Supreme Treasure, he was like a god that no one dared to profane.
 Li Yao was shocked.
 What a profound Dao technique!
 Compared to the Primordial Chaos Reincarnation Great Dao, her previous cultivation technique was the same as the martial arts manuals in the mortal world. It was worlds apart.
 She bit her lips and said, “Thank you, Sect Master. I’ve already comprehended the Dao technique. What does Sect Master need me to?do?”
 Han Jue didn’t even open his eyes as he said, “Go out and cultivate. Reach the Emperor Realm as soon as possible.”
 Li Yao nodded and left.
 She felt a little awkward.
 She had thought that this time, she would lose…
 She also liked Han Jue. Which woman didn’t like a man like him?
 She seemed to be thinking too much. Han Jue didn’t have such thoughts.
 For a time, Han Jue’s image in Li Yao’s heart became holy and mighty.
 Han Jue understood her thoughts, but he didn’t care. He wasn’t a mortal. How could the joy of the body be compared to the transformation of his soul?
 Of course, if Li Yao was as proactive as Xing Hongxuan, Han Jue wouldn’t have rejected her.
 Lust was not something he would actively seek. Han Jue had a lot of expectations for Li Yao. She was the first person to receive his true inheritance. The reason why he taught her was not only because of her talent but also because of her personality. Li Yao was too similar to him!
 After walking out of the cave abode, Li Yao was surrounded by everyone. “Why did Master look for you?” “After staying for so long, you must have inherited something!”
 “When will it be my turn?”
 “Don’t tell me you want to eat your master. That must be the case. I’ve seen other women do the same.” “Be quiet. Don’t let Grandmaster hear you.”
 “You’re joking. Perhaps the Sect Master can hear your inner thoughts. What’s the use of keeping your voice down?”
 Facing everyone’s questions, Li Yao said calmly, “I asked for guidance on the Sword Dao. I’m about to become stronger. To the four Immortal Emperors here, good luck to you.”
 The Black Hell Demon Lord, Jiang Yi, Diamond Rage, and Duan Hongchen were all shocked.
 This woman is about to reach the Emperor Realm?
 Even Jiang Yi felt the pressure. Li Yao’s talent was indeed terrifying. Most importantly, she was willing to cultivate. Usually, she was the only one cultivating and could not be bothered to chat with others. “Cultivate well. I will nurture you according to your performance. The Hidden Sect is only hidden, not lazy or complacent.”
 Han Jue’s voice floated out and frightened everyone. At the same time, hope rose in their hearts.
 They also wanted to become stronger!
 In the blink of an eye.
 Another ten years passed.
 Han Jue took out the Book of Misfortune and started cursing the enemies while checking his emails.
 Recently, the Heavenly Court had welcomed another war and was surrounded by many factions. Han Jue couldn’t help but worry for the Heavenly Emperor.
 Especially Long Hao, Han Jue felt that it was difficult.
 He wanted to kill Hao Tian, but he was afraid of harming the Heavenly Emperor. “I hope you won’t act recklessly. Otherwise, for your father’s sake, I’ll have to kill you.”
 Han Jue sighed in his heart, and his eyes became firm.
 There was no perfect plan in the world. Han Jue only needed to follow his heart!
 At this moment…
 Han Jue suddenly felt that someone was using the Invocation Technique.
 He couldn’t help but become nervous.
 Could it be Long Hao?
 Trick him over and mess with him?
