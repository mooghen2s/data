 He looked forward to these Fiendcelestial Qi more than the Nether Race.
 He would be invincible if he could really create the Chaotic Fiendcelestials!
 Wait!
 Han Jue suddenly had a bold idea. Su Qi’s soul was still in his hand. He had just entered a deep sleep. If Su Qi was reincarnated into the Chaotic Fiendcelestial’s body…
 The moment this thought appeared, it quickly took root in Han Jue’s mind.
 He could test it!
 If he succeeded, Han Jue would obtain a huge opportunity that would make all living beings go mad!
 “Dear disciple, I’ll test you with this. Try to survive. Don’t blame me if you fail!”
 Han Jue thought silently as he fixed his gaze on the Death Fiendcelestial.
 Su Qi was the God of Misfortune. Whoever touched him would die. It suited the character of death.
 With that thought, Han Jue fused Su Qi’s soul into the Death Fiendcelestial’s Fiendcelestial
 He was very worried that Su Qi would be directly crushed to death by the Great Dao of the Death Fiendcelestial. He had no choice but to use his Dharmic powers to protect his soul body and slowly let it fuse.
 Time flew.
 Days passed.
 Even Han Jue, who was already at the perfected Pseudo-Sage Realm, was trembling in fear. Even if the Chaotic Fiendcelestial was a Dharma idol, its power was too strong and could tear Su Qi apart at any time.
 After thirty years, Han Jue finally waited for Su Qi to fuse with the Death Fiendcelestial. However, the fusion process was extremely slow and there was still a strong rejection.
 Han Jue had no choice but to multitask. He controlled Su Qi’s fusion while cultivating.
 After all, with thirty years of accumulation, Han Jue became more relaxed in the future.
 At the same time, the Hundred Peak Immortal River was still flourishing. Figures could be seen cultivating everywhere, and people sparred in the sky from time to time.
 Not all living beings could enter the simulation trial, so they could only fight in reality. At the same time, they wanted the personal disciples to see and accept them as disciples.
 Occasionally, there would be a situation where Han Zuitian was severely punished under Li Xuan’ao’s guidance. From then on, such a situation did not happen.
 Li Yao suddenly came to visit Han Jue, who let her into the Daoist temple.
 This woman was actually about to reach the Zenith Heaven Realm!
 She was even faster than Zhou Fan and Jiang
 Yi.
 It was all thanks to her diligent cultivation. The others, including Zhou Fan and Zhao Xuanyuan, would go to the simulation trial from time to time. Li Yao had been cultivating and did not even participate in the hundred-year competition. She was focused on the Great Dao of Extreme Origin.
 “I want to create a Sword Great Dao within the Great Dao of Extreme Origin. What do you think?” Li Yao asked.
 Han Jue asked, “Do you really like swords?”
 Most of the Mystical Powers Li Yao learned were Sword Dao Mystical Powers, but Han Jue felt that she didn’t really love the Sword Dao. She was more affected by Dao Comprehension Sword.
 Dao Comprehension Sword could be said to be a pure sword cultivator. This was something that even Li Daokong could not compare to. Although Li Daokong was the number one sword cultivator in the Immortal World, he was still involved in other things. It was just that his Sword Dao was most outstanding.
 Li Yao said, “Preference isn’t important. What’s important is that I’m confident in it. I want to become an existence who has grasped the Sword Dao.”
 Her eyes were serious and her tone was calm.
 Han Jue actually felt that it made sense.
 He didn’t really like the Sword Dao himself, but his main identity was a sword cultivator.
 Cultivators should indeed not be particular about liking something. As long as they could be of use, they could cultivate anything.
 Han Jue said, “I want to know what your Sword Dao is.”
 Li Yao frowned. “To be honest, I haven’t figured it out, but I want to be like you. I want to kill my enemy with one strike. In my opinion, sword cultivators who need to execute a second strike are nothing.
 “Slaughter the enemy with one sword, split open the sky with one sword, cut down the Dao with one sword. Those who stop me will be cut down with one sword strike.”
 Li Yao beamed as she said, “I think I’ve found it. This is my Sword Dao. Can you guide me?”
 Han Jue said meaningfully, “Then, you should pursue Dharmic powers. No matter how powerful a Mystical Power is, it still needs to rely on immense Dharmic powers. I’ll preach the Dao for you and help you. As for when you will step into the Zenith Heaven Realm, that will depend on your performance.”
 It had to be said that Li Yao’s comprehension talent was too strong. She was only thirty thousand years old and was about to reach the Zenith Heaven Realm. It was simply ridiculous.
 Was she cheating?
 Han Jue thought of how Zhou Fan and Fang Liang’s Connate providence had changed. Could Li Yao have also changed?
 “I want to know Li Yao’s background.” Han Jue thought silently.

 (Li Yao: Six Mystic Divine Origin, Child of Heaven and Earth, descendant of a Sage. Born with a Heavenly Phoenix. Blessed in the mortal world. She cultivated for 700 years and reached the Mahayana Realm. She is cautious by nature and hates fighting. She likes to cultivate.]
 Han Jue narrowed his eyes. Li Yao was a descendant of an Immortal Emperor previously. Why did she suddenly become a descendant of a Sage?
 Could it be that Li Yao’s ancestor had become a Sage from the Immortal Emperor Realm after all these years?
 Impossible!
 Wasn’t that even more monstrous than him?
 Han Jue continued to ask, “I want to know why her ancestor could become a Sage?”

 A white-robed man appeared in Han Jue’s mind. He was handsome and looked like he walked out of a painting. He was almost catching up to Han Jue.
 [Li Zizai: Freedom Sage. Thousands of origin clones walk the Heavenly Dao of all directions and experience the myriad worlds of the mortal world. The main body has refined the Primordial Chaos Zenith Heaven Dao Fruit and become a Freedom Sage. The Dao Field has landed in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End.]
 Freedom Sage!
 Sounds impressive!
 Wait, this fellow had thousands of clones. Did that mean that Li Yao was not the only one?
 Why was Li Yao so impressive?
 Han Jue frowned and then relaxed his eyebrows.
 That made sense. Only Li Yao encountered him, the other descendants had probably died in the previous calamity.
 Han Jue couldn’t help but sigh. What was this?
 When a person attained the Dao, all his friends would ascend to the heavens!
 “Sect Master?”
 Li Yao’s voice interrupted his thoughts.
 Han Jue said calmly, “I’m calculating your fate. What Sword Dao suits you?”
 Li Yao felt deep veneration. Han Jue could even deduce it. His cultivation was unimaginable.
 Han Jue began to preach the Dao, and Li Yao quickly immersed herself in it.
 ner
 …
 Spring and autumn alternated, the sun and moon rotated.
 A thousand years passed.
 Han Jue finally found the thought of attaining the Dao. His Dharmic powers had already reached a point where they couldn’t increase anymore. The negative karma in the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus was still immense and seemed endless.
 In the past thousand years, Su Qi and the Death Fiendcelestial had completely fused together and were no longer repelled. However, he was still in a deep sleep and could not wake up. It was probably because the Death Fiendcelestial still needed to be nurtured for a period of time.
 “Disciple Yang Tiandong is here to visit Master. I hope Master can meet me.”
 A voice resounded through the world. The Hidden Sect’s personal disciples were stunned.
 Yang Tiandong?
 Wasn’t he dead?
 Han Jue opened his eyes and used the simulation trial to check his surroundings. He quickly locked onto Yang Tiandong.
 (Yang Tiandong: Rank One Immortal Emperor, King of Hell, Ancestral Magus Bloodline]
 Eh?
 Ancestral Magus bloodline?
 Han Jue raised his eyebrows. Empress Houtu had invested a lot in him. Previously, Tu Ling’er had also obtained the blood of the Ancestral Magus. It wasn’t impossible for Yang Tiandong to obtain it too.
 But why was he back at this time?
 Han Jue directly deduced.
