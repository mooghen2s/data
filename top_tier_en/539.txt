 [Not for the time being.)
 Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief and decided to accept the dream.
 In the blink of an eye, he entered the dream realm.
 He came to an absolutely dark space. Golden light shone ahead and roared. It was deafening.
 Han Jue focused his gaze and saw that Qiu Xilai, who had transformed into a golden Buddha, was fighting. Countless Heavenly Devils surrounded him like ants devouring an elephant. It was a spectacular sight.
 The Buddhist light on Qiu Xilai’s body flickered. His gaze was fixed on the burly Heavenly Devil.
 This demon was covered in black flames. It had eight arms and three heads. Its face was ferocious and its long hair fluttered. It was like the legendary Rakshasa. Its entire body was black, and its muscles were like heavy armor. It was visually impactful.
 From afar, the battle between Qiu Xilai and the Dao Heavenly Devil was like the battle of the gods and devils in ancient legends. The surrounding Heavenly Devils were only demons and monsters who wanted to devour their bodies.
 “Han Jue, I’m not the Dao Heavenly Devil’s match. The other Sages can’t help me because they abandoned the Heavenly Dao’s providence. Come quickly! If I die, the Heavenly Dao will be in danger!” Qiu Xilai’s voice resounded in his ears, his tone anxious.
 Han Jue said calmly, “I understand. I’ll come when I’m ready.”
 “What else do you need to prepare?”
 “Prepare to kill Dao Heavenly Devil.”
 “Impossible. Even I can’t kill him. You can only join forces with me to force him back!”
 “That’s you. I think I can do it.”
 “You…”
 “That’s all. If you die, I will treat the Buddhist Sect well and help when they are in danger. Treat it as me returning the favor. You took care of my disciples, and I will take care of
 yours.”
 With that, Han Jue directly broke through the dream, and his consciousness returned to reality.
 He continued to cultivate.
 Save Qiu Xilai?
 Not for the time being!
 What if this fellow still attacked him?
 Even if it was only a possibility, Han Jue couldn’t take the risk.
 He believed that Qiu Xilai would survive. What did he have to say?
 Bad people usually caused trouble for a millennium.
 In the endless desert, sand filled the sky. Sounds of battle and roars filled the air.
 Han Ming and Han Tuo were surrounded by thousands of Heavenly Devils and fought a bloody battle.
 Han Tuo was covered in injuries, and his swords were already filled with holes. At this rate, he would die in the hands of the Heavenly Devils sooner or later.
 “Run first. I’ll hold them back!” Han Ming suddenly shouted. He spread his arms, and his Dharmic powers transformed into bolts of lightning that wrapped around all the Heavenly Devils like lightning chains that formed a spider web.
 Han Tuo said anxiously, “I can’t abandon you!”
 “Get lost! I’ll only be able to escape if you escape. You’re my burden now!” Han Ming said impatiently. The thousands of Heavenly Devils struggled wildly. Their roars shook the world and were terrifying.
 Han Tuo gritted his teeth and left.
 Looking at his departing figure, Han Ming heaved a sigh of relief.
 After Han Tuo disappeared into the horizon, he finally relaxed. The Heavenly Devils broke free from the lightning chains and pounced at him again.
 Han Ming smiled sadly and muttered, “I’ve returned the life I owed you.”
 The next second, his eyes turned ferocious.
 “I, Han Ming, have lived two lifetimes. How can I die here?”
 “Even if I die, I will die spectacularly!”
 Boom
 He mobilized his Dao Fruit and activated his Dharmic powers. His aura was magnificent.
 Sword Qi condensed out of thin air and transformed into thousands of sword shadows that swept in all directions.
 All the Heavenly Devils broke free from the lightning chains and attacked him, almost drowning him.
 Han Ming used his hand as a sword and fought with all his might.
 A four-winged Heavenly Devil with a tiger head and a human body was chopped into two by Han Ming. However, soon, his body fused together again and his injuries recovered.
Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m Such scenes appeared one after another. Han Ming frowned. So far, not one of the Heavenly Devils had truly died.
 Han Ming felt despair.
 He was really going to die this time!
 “Roar!”
 A terrifying roar exploded. It was even more terrifying than all the nearby Heavenly Devils.
 The Heavenly Devils turned around as if they were facing a great enemy. Han Ming also looked over.
 A terrifying black shadow appeared in the sky. It was like a Heavenly Devil and emitted a powerful aura. It was rushing over crazily.
 Looking carefully, a tiny figure could be seen under this 30km tall black shadow. It was Han Tuo.
 A ten-thousand-foot tall black shadow emerged from above Han Tuo’s head. He lowered his head and rushed towards the Heavenly Devil. His black hair was messy as if he was possessed by a madman.
 “This kid…”
 Han Ming was shocked and couldn’t believe his eyes.
 This power was so strong!
 He instinctively felt fear even from so far away.
 “Could it be a power bestowed by him?”
 Han Ming had a complicated expression.
 If it was him, everything would make sense.
 I still owe you my life.
 Sigh.
 Another 90 years passed.
 Many Heavenly Devils were wandering outside the Hundred Peak Immortal River. All the Heavenly Devils had intelligence, but their communication method was different from the Heavenly Dao lifeforms. The Hundred Peak Immortal River couldn’t be broken through, making them realize that treasures or mighty figures from the Immortal World might be hidden here.
 The Heavenly Devil had descended into the Immortal World. Their mission was to slaughter all living beings!
 As the Heavenly Devils began to camp in the Hundred Peak Immortal River, the Hidden Sect disciples also became nervous.
 This calamity was clearly different from the past. Could the Hidden Sect still protect itself?
 “The merging of the Dao Sect by the Sages must be related to the Heavenly Devils.”
 “I heard from the living beings passing by that the Immortal World is already in chaos.”
 “It’s said that the Heavenly Devils come from the Chaos and can’t be killed.”
 “Sect Master didn’t say anything, either. Let’s cultivate in peace.”
 “I’m just afraid that more and more Heavenly Devils will come. There will be enough to crush our array formation.”
 “What are you afraid of? Hurry up and cultivate. Don’t always think of relying on the personal disciples and the Sect Master to protect you. We have to work hard!”
 While the Hidden Sect disciples were discussing, Han Jue was checking his emails in the Daoist temple.

 Qiu Xilai was really pitiful!
 Han Jue sympathized, but he had to stay calm.
 Qiu Xilai didn’t save him. He only saved his good friend and even plotted against Han Jue now.
 Han Jue’s greatest repayment was to save the Buddhist Sect in the future. It was impossible to save Qiu Xilai now. It had to be said that the Heavenly Devils’ attack was very powerful this time. It looked like the Immeasurable Calamity.
 Looking down, his friends were all fighting with the Heavenly Devils.
 Han Jue’s blood boiled.
 Should he go out and fight to his heart’s content?
 No!
 Stay cau… cautious! He had to insta-kill the Dao Heavenly Devil first. Otherwise, if he cultivated for forty thousand years and his Dao became nothing, it would be too awkward.
 Han Jue took a deep breath to calm down.
 He suddenly had a question.
 Was there a huge conspiracy behind this Heavenly Devil attack?
 The Heavenly Emperor was even attacked by a Heavenly Devil in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End…
 Could it be that this calamity didn’t just affect the Heavenly Dao Immortal World?
