 Seven Dao Sage smiled. “That’s right. It’s not easy for me to be in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End. I’m not like Fellow Daoist Xitian, who sits at the peak of the Heavenly Dao and doesn’t care about anything.”
 Dijun did not say anything, but his smile was filled with deep meaning.
 The atmosphere between the four mighty figures became subtle.
 Ancestor Xitian wasn’t angry. “If you want to take over the responsibility of protecting the Heavenly Dao, I have no objections.”
 Jade Bodhi and Seven Dao Sage did not retort.
 Dijun smiled. “Come, come, come. It’s not easy for us to meet. Don’t become angry. All of you are existences who can compete with the Heavenly Dao in terms of lifespan. The outcome of the previous battle has yet to be determined. Let’s continue killing!”
 Seven Dao Sage snorted? “So be it. If you have the guts, don’t target me. Watch as I kill you all.”
 “What a joke. Do I need to target to kill you?”
 The four mighty figures sat together. The atmosphere suddenly changed.
 Time flew.
 As usual, Han Jue was immersed in his seclusion cultivation and enjoyed the pleasure of his cultivation level increasing step by step. Suddenly, he sensed something and opened his eyes. In the nine heavens, Fang Liang stood in front of the South-Heaven Gate, absorbing the providence of the world. His body emitted white light and his body was illusory, like a projection. Han Jue showed a frown.
 This kid…
 He was not only absorbing the providence of the Heavenly Dao. To be precise, he was like the Fusang Tree, absorbing the natural source of the Immortal World!
 This action would definitely alarm the Sages. This fellow had been the Heavenly Emperor before, so he should know this. It could only mean that Fang Liang was confident. Fang Liang was already at the Zenith Heaven Realm, but over the years, his cultivation level had not improved much, as if he had encountered a bottleneck.
 Han Jue didn’t stop him. He wanted to see what Fang Liang wanted to do.
 He opened his attributes list and discovered that 1,620 years had passed.
 Time passed quickly.
 Han Jue looked at Han Tuo. This kid had been hanging out with Yi Tian recently. There was also Han Ming. The three of them were exploring an Ancient Mystic Realm that was located overseas. Han Jue could sense that a Heavenly Dao Numinous Treasure was hidden in the Ancient Mystic Realm. It was left behind by Li Muyi.
 The current Han Tuo had already stepped into the Deity Realm and could be considered to have completely established himself in the Immortal World.
 Han Jue looked at Han Yu again.
 This fellow had unknowingly ascended to the Immortal World and had currently joined a cultivation sect. His status was very low, and he was guarding a medicinal garden.
 Han Jue couldn’t help but think of his younger self, who also guarded a herb garden.
 It had to be said that this kid was very fated with him.
 They looked alike and had similar encounters.
 Ever since he was saved by Han Jue, Han Yu had become extremely cautious and obsessed with cultivation. This made Han Jue very satisfied.
 Han Tuo walked a completely different path from him, while Han Yu followed Han Jue.
 After hesitating for a moment, Han Jue decided to cast a spell to visit Han Yu.
 The mountain was like a forest. Halfway up a mountain, Han Yu sat on a huge rock. In front of him was a pool with strange flowers.
 Han Yu wore a white robe and was very handsome.
 A group of female disciples flew on their swords and stopped when they passed by.
 “Junior Han, are you coming with us to train?” A gorgeously dressed female disciple covered her mouth and asked with a smile.
 The other female disciples also looked at him with bright eyes.
 Han Yu was too handsome. No male disciple in the entire sect could compare to him in terms of looks.
 Han Yu opened his eyes and shook his head. “Thank you for your kind intentions, senior sisters. I still have to guard the herbs. Perhaps next time.”
 The green-robed female disciple curled her lips. “You always say next time, you fool.”
 With that, she turned and left.
 The other female disciples followed closely behind. One of them said coquettishly, “Oh you, are you really stupid? If you followed our senior, would you still need to be a medicine guardian here?”
 Han Yu smiled bitterly and did not answer.
 After the female disciples left, he heaved a sigh of relief.
 “You don’t like women?” A mocking voice sounded.
 A white-robed man had unknowingly appeared under the tree beside the medicinal pool. The tree’s shade covered his face, preventing Han Yu from seeing him clearly.
 Han Yu frowned. He wasn’t a mortal, but he still couldn’t see the other party’s face. What did this mean?
 It meant that the other party’s cultivation level far exceeded his!
 Han Yu asked warily, “Who are you?”
 The white-robed man was naturally Han Jue.
 Han Jue asked with a faint smile, “Answer me first.”
 Han Yu said, “Of course not. It’s just that I’m very restrained. I don’t want women to affect my cultivation.”
 “Why?”
 “My clan was once slaughtered. Before that, I was tied down by my clan and couldn’t focus on cultivating.”
 “You plan to be alone forever?”
 “After I become stronger, I will definitely create the Han family again. It’s just that I’m not strong enough.”
 “Oh? Then, how strong do you want to be?”
 “At least a Grand Unity True Immortal… You might laugh at me. How can a slave like me reach the Grand Unity True Immortal Realm?”
 Han Jue smiled.
 Han Yu heard his laughter and felt bitter.
 Han Jue suddenly asked, “If I can give you the Dao technique to reach the Grand Unity True Immortal Realm, what are you willing to do?”
 Han Yu was stunned.
 His first reaction was vigilance. Could the other party be a sinister devil?
 This was not the first time he had encountered a sinister cultivator who was good at lying from the mortal world to the Immortal World.
 However, for some reason, Han Yu wanted to trust him.
 This feeling terrified him.
 The other party must have used some bewitching technique on him!
 No!
 I want to wake up!
T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by nov(ê(l)biin.co/m Han Yu’s expression turned sinister. Han Jue was surprised. What was this kid doing?
 After a while.
 Han Yu said, “Thank you for your kind intentions, Senior. Forget it, I’ll rely on myself.”
 “If you miss this opportunity, you might not encounter it again. Are you really going to reject me?”
 “I’ve made up my mind…”
 Han Jue remained silent.
 He had been rejected!
 Han Jue immediately disappeared.
 Han Yu heaved a sigh of relief. He had really suffered a lot today. Fortunately, his Dao heart was firm.
 Inside the Daoist temple.
 Han Jue opened his eyes with a strange expression.
 He had been kind enough to give him an opportunity, but he had been rejected!
 It had been a long time since he had been rejected. This feeling was quite strange.
 “In that case, I want to see if you will regret
 it.”
 Han Jue snorted and thought.
 “Kid, cultivation doesn’t rely on determination!”
 Then, Han Jue closed his eyes and continued cultivating.
 He cultivated for a thousand years.
 When he opened his eyes again, the first person he looked at was Han Yu.
 After a thousand years, Han Yu had changed sects.
 This kid had just been hunted down by the Famous Race not long ago and was hiding in a valley cultivating.
 His cultivation level had just stepped into the Grand Unity Earth Immortal Realm.
 He had only increased his cultivation by so little in a thousand years. His potential could not be said to be poor. It could only be said to be mediocre.
 After the Heavenly Dao restarted, the various mortal worlds reappeared. However, the transformation rules for ascension had yet to appear. Therefore, Han Yu’s cultivation level was completely cultivated step by step. The cultivation technique he cultivated was still the one Han Tuo had left for his son.
