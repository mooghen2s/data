 Usually, Zhou Fan, Dao Sovereign, and Zhao Xuanyuan wouldn’t go to the Chaotic Domain. However, the Myriad Worlds Projection was very lively. The disciples often communicated with Li Daokong and Han You, asking about what was happening in the outside world.
 Han Jue said, “Is that all?”
 Dao Sovereign hurriedly said, “These two newcomers have very strong potential. In addition, I want to go out and seek opportunities.”
 Two newcomers?
 Not only Tian, but there was also someone
 else?
 Han Jue was slightly curious, but he didn’t care in the end. “You’ve reached the Pseudo-Sage Realm?”
 “No, but…”
 “You want to go against my will?”
Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com “No, no…”
 Terrified, Dao Sovereign hurriedly tried to explain.
 Han Jue said, “I don’t want to save you anymore, understand? If you dare to make such a request again, the threshold of leaving the mountain will increase to the Sage Realm.”
 “I understand. I was rude,” Dao Sovereign said helplessly. But Han Jue was right. When he recalled the bumpy situation of the previous calamity, his heart still palpitated.
 “Little brat, you actually want to trick me.”
 After Dao Sovereign thought it through, he was filled with fear.
 Han Jue waved his hand and gestured for him to leave.
 After Dao Sovereign left, Han Jue still didn’t go to the Chaotic Domain. His gaze landed on Han Tuo.
 This fellow was still cultivating in seclusion. His providence and reputation in the Immortal World were weak and he could be considered nameless.
 He suddenly had an idea.
 The appearance of Tian was a whetstone for Han Tuo.
 If he didn’t have a powerful enemy in his life, how could he continue forward?
 Even though Han Jue had the system, he would also treat all living beings as formidable enemies and encourage himself.
 After thinking, Han Jue raised his hand and waved a beam of light. It quickly disappeared like lightning
 …
 Time passed.
 Another 300 years passed.
 While cultivating, Han Jue opened his eyes and started to check his emails.
 (Your good friend Evil Heavenly Emperor was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure and was severely injured.]
 [Your good friend Qiu Xilai has fused with the Heavenly Dao’s providence. His cultivation has increased greatly.]
 [Your good friend Li Daokong was attacked by your good friend Three Pure Sacred Ancestor. He was severely injured.]
 (Your good friend Shi Dudao has entered the Dark Forbidden Zone.]
 (Your good friend Fang Liang was attacked by an unknown space-time power and was severely injured.]
 (Your son Han Tuo’s bloodline potential has increased. His cultivation has increased greatly.)
 [Your good friend Han Ming was cursed by a mysterious curse.]
 (Your grand-disciple Chu Shiren received your good friend Qiu Xilai’s dream.]
 The situation of the emails became complicated. Han Jue read it with relish.
 He noticed that Qiu Xilai had sent a dream to Chu Shiren.
 What was this old fellow trying to do?
 Han Jue continued to read the emails.
 An hour later, Han Jue called Chu Shiren over.
 Chu Shiren quickly arrived at the Daoist temple and bowed respectfully.
 Han Jue asked, “How have you been cultivating recently?”.
 Chu Shiren said, “As usual.”
 He hesitated for a moment and said, “You know that Sage Qiu Xilai sent me a dream?”
 “I don’t know.”
 Chu Shiren took a deep breath and said, “Qiu Xilai hopes that I can return to the Buddhist Sect.”
 This time, he did not even use the word Sage. It could be seen that he had already chosen his side.
 Han Jue said, “Oh? Really? What do you think?”
 Chu Shiren shook his head. “I’m naturally unwilling. If I return to the Buddhist Sect, I’ll become a pawn again. It’s good to be in the Hidden Sect. You never ask me to do anything against my will. Here, I can still cultivate in peace.”
 Not long ago, he hated cultivating. Now that he was cultivating very actively, he would reach the Zenith Heaven Realm sooner or later.
 Han Jue said, “Cultivate well. You can leave after reaching the Pseudo-Sage Realm. Remember, I don’t have many requirements for the Hidden Sect disciples. However, there is one rule. You are not to betray the Hidden Sect, and you are not allowed to kill each other. Otherwise, I can take back what I can give you. Under the Heavenly Dao, no one can save you if you betray me.”
 Chu Shiren hurriedly bowed to show his loyalty.
 Han Jue didn’t say anything else.
 After leaving the Daoist temple, Chu Shiren heaved a sigh of relief.
 “Grandmaster’s ability is really impressive. Even a Sage’s dream can be detected by him. Qiu Xilai wants to harm me?”
 Chu Shiren thought to himself.
 As he passed Zhang Jue, he suddenly opened his eyes and stared at him.
 Chu Shiren’s heart beat wildly.
 The Sage’s gaze was filled with pressure.
 Chu Shiren suddenly realized that other than Han Jue, there were other powerful and mysterious existences in the Hidden Sect. These mysterious existences did not communicate with the disciples and were only loyal to Han Jue.
 With that thought, Chu Shiren bowed to Zhang Jue and quickened his pace, leaving hurriedly.
 This small incident did not cause a stir in the Hidden Sect.
 As their cultivation level increased, the hearts of people would also change. Han Jue could understand. His current mentality was also very different from when he was weak. His ambitions would also change. However, in the Hundred Peak Immortal River, all the rules were determined by Han Jue!
 Although these disciples were very respectful, that was only for him. They were all proud and arrogant people. Once they were released, after so many years, they might turn against each other.
 Back then, even the Three Pure Ones under the Dao Ancestor could turn against each other. Han Jue naturally didn’t feel that his disciples would always be united.
 Sixty-two years later.
 Han Zuitian came to visit him and asked if he should release another batch of disciples. They were naturally in-name disciples.
 Recently, he had calculated that another batch of disciples couldn’t increase their cultivation no matter how they cultivated.
 Han Jue said, “Choose. Let them go to the Heavenly Race and serve the Heavenly Ancestor Ji Xianshen in the future.”
 Han Zuitian accepted the order.
 Several days later, a thousand Immortal Emperors took their positions. Han Jue waved his hand and sent them out.
 In the current Immortal World, a thousand Immortal Emperors was a force that could not be underestimated.
 Ji Xianshen was pleasantly surprised when he received the in-name disciples.
 “As expected of Master. You’ve been thinking about me,” Ji Xianshen thought to himself. Although these disciples could not compare to a thousand Nether Zeniths, they were definitely not weak.
 Ji Xianshen warmly welcomed the Hidden Sect disciples.
 The Heavenly Race was shocked. When the immortals from the other sects learned that the Hidden Sect had sent over a thousand Immortal Emperors, they were all terrified and did not dare to go against Ji Xianshen.
 Although the Hidden Sect kept a low profile, once it was mentioned, all living beings would recall all sorts of legends.
 The Providence Sect disciples had even been warned by their elders not to provoke the Hidden Sect.
 On the other side.
 33rd Heaven, Sage Dao Field.
 Huang Zuntian knelt in front of Sect Master Tian Jue with a respectful attitude.
 Sect Master Tian Jue sized him up and said, “Huang Zuntian, you have already joined the Jie School for forty thousand years. What do you think of the Immortal World?”
 Huang Zuntian replied, “The Sages play chess and all living beings are pawns. The direction of the Immortal World’s providence is entirely determined by the Sages’ intentions.”
 Sect Master Tian Jue said meaningfully, “Is this the reason why you led the Jie School to rest and recuperate?”
 “That’s right. If not for the Sage’s arrangements, we would have acted rashly and only dug our own graves.” “You’re smart. Now that you’re the Sect Master of the Jie School, what else do you want to pursue?”
 Huang Zuntian was silent and did not answer immediately.
 What did he mean?
 Was the Sage testing him?
 Huang Zuntian’s thoughts raced as he quickly weighed the pros and cons.
