 How could he be so nosy?
 No!
 How could he be so concerned about the Heavenly Emperor!
 Han Jue didn’t expect the collapsed Demon Court to rise again and even wanted to fight the Heavenly Court!
 Han Jue suddenly wanted to check the greatest winner of the calamity. Would it become the Golden Crow Divine Clan?
 Then, he shook his head.
 He felt that he couldn’t easily scheme for the end of the calamity. It would only cause more chaos.
 He only needed to protect the people around him.
 Han Jue didn’t plan to ask Jiang Yi, lest it made him seem overly concerned about the situation of the calamity.
 He couldn’t be suspected of being the Dark Forbidden Lord.
 Once someone suspected him, the Sages would follow these thoughts and think of him. It wasn’t impossible for a Sage to read the thoughts of all living beings!
 me  Time passed. About twenty years later, some of the Deity Realm experts of the Jie School began to wander the Nine Nether Purgatory. They even passed by the Hidden Sect Island. Fortunately, the island was small and was not discovered.
 As long as they didn’t find Hidden Sect Island, Han Jue would pretend that they didn’t exist.
 However, one thing was very annoying. When the mighty figure of the intercepting sect approached, Han Jue no longer dared to absorb the negative karma outside the island.
 On this day.
 Han Jue stopped cultivating and took out the Book of Misfortune to curse the enemy while checking his emails. (Your grand-disciple Fang Liang’s soul has returned to his body. His cultivation has increased greatly and he has stepped into the Emperor Realm.] (Your good friend Ji Xianshen was attacked by the Golden Crow Divine Clan] x7820
 (Your good friend Huang Zuntian was cursed by a mysterious curse.]
 [Your good friend Heavenly Emperor has activated the Divine Investiture Board and released the Heavenly Souls of the Primordial Immortal Gods.)
 [Your disciple Long Hao has obtained the providence of the True Dragon Race. His cultivation has increased greatly.)
 [Your good friend Tai Sutian has joined the Demon Race’s Heavenly Court.)
 (Your good friend Dao Sovereign has awakened his Chaotic Physique and his bloodline has transformed.]
 (Your disciple Su Qi’s divinity has increased. His bad luck has increased greatly.]
 There were all sorts of fortuitous encounters. It felt like everyone’s story could write a novel in itself.
 The chaotic battle of protagonists?
 Han Jue suddenly started to look forward to what would happen when the calamity reached its peak.
 Chaotic battle of prodigies?
 The downfall of the gods?
 It’s too dangerous!
 Although his talent was unparalleled, Han Jue felt if he entered the calamity, he would probably be unable to protect himself. Fortunately, he chose to avoid the calamity and cultivate.
 [More than a hundred people have become ones facing the calamity. You have the following choices:)
 [1: Enter the calamity immediately and become a person facing the calamity. You can obtain a Mystical Power inheritance and a Great Dao Fragment.) [2: Avoid the calamity temporarily and stay away from conflict. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment.)
 A hundred?
 So many?
 Han Jue was secretly shocked. He knew that it was such a coincidence. His good friends had become people facing calamity one after another.
 He didn’t expect that only a small portion of his good friends would face the calamity.
 Han Jue seemed to see a group of mighty figures standing above the Heavenly Dao, looking down on the myriad worlds. They used all living beings as a chessboard, and the people facing the calamity were their pawns. Every time a stone landed, the calamity would stir up a storm.
 Han Jue silently chose the second option. At this point, he gathered all nine Grand Dao Fragments again! Han Jue fused the nine Great Dao fragments and started to comprehend the Supreme Dao technique.
 He already had a cultivation technique. This time, he hoped to comprehend a Mystical Power!
 He thought of the Heavenly Emperor and Nüwa’s Dream Entering Mystical Power.
 He also wanted this Mystical Power.
 It would make it easier for him to use his identity as the Dark Forbidden Lord.
 It was best not to be affected by karma and not be discovered by the Sages!
 With a Great Dao epiphany, he should be able to create a Mystical Power that surpassed a Sage!
 With this thought, Han Jue’s consciousness entered a mysterious state.
 Numinous Palace.
 The Heavenly Emperor was holding a scroll in his hand and pondering when he suddenly looked up.
 Purple light appeared in the sky outside the hall, as beautiful as a painting.
 The Heavenly Emperor frowned and muttered, “Another mighty figure has appeared.”
 Such a phenomenon could not be caused by an ordinary prodigy. Other than potential, one had to have a powerful cultivation level.
 Such a phenomenon seemed to have occurred a thousand years ago.
 At this moment. A figure flew into the hall. It was the Divine General.
 The Divine General wore exquisite silver armor and a cloak that fluttered behind him like flames. The two phoenix wings on his crown fluttered without end.
 He bowed respectfully and said, “Your Majesty, the True Dragon Race has already declared that they will join Long Hao’s Dragon Court. It’s not only the True Dragon Race, but the sea demons have also joined the Dragon Court. Their power is rapidly rising.”
 The Heavenly Emperor narrowed his eyes. “Dragon Court. This kid is smart enough to rope in the Dragon Race.”
 The Divine General asked, “Do you want to deal with it? We can take this opportunity to destroy it.”
 “There’s no need. It just so happens that the Heavenly Court is the sole dominant force. It’s not a good thing.
 “The Jie School has retreated. All of them have hidden in the Nine Nether Purgatory. The Chan School’s attitude has also become subtle.
 “The two sects of the Dao Sect have their own ambitions. In any case, the Heavenly Court has already defeated the Divine Palace and the Demon Court. If they want to leave, so be it. I’m still afraid of helping them repay their karma.”
 The Divine General nodded.
 The Heavenly Emperor asked, “Have you seen the past Heavenly Emperors?”
 The Divine General replied, “Yes, including Hao Tian.”
 “Who chose you?”
 “Dijun.”
 “Oh?”
 The Heavenly Emperor’s expression changed slightly as his eyes flickered.
 The Divine General continued, “Dijun taught me a Mystical Power and told me that this calamity will become the first game of chess for the Sages. As long as the Heavenly Court is not destroyed, it will be considered a win.”
 The Heavenly Emperor was deep in thought.
 “Dijun also said that Han Jue, who you brought along to listen to the Dao Lecture, is a variable. He hopes you can grasp it well.” After the Divine General said that, he also started thinking
 He had been thinking about this, too.
 The Heavenly Emperor smiled and said, “I already know. Next, cultivate Dijun’s Mystical Power well and strive to be as strong as the Heavenly God General. I trust you the most. Don’t disappoint me.”
 “I understand!”
 The Divine General cupped his hands and bowed before leaving. The Heavenly Emperor looked up at the purple mist outside the hall and chuckled. “So be it. The more chaotic it is, the better. This is a good opportunity for me to calm down.”
 At the same time, the various powers in the Immortal World were alarmed by the Heavenly Dao phenomenon.
 Not only the Immortal World, but all the worlds in the universe could also see it.
 Even those in the netherworld and the Nine Nether Purgatory.
 The Black Hell Demon Lord’s gaze passed through the Dao Field and looked at the purple mist above the Nine Nether Purgatory. He couldn’t help but sigh. “The calamity is the calamity. There are all sorts of influential figures.”
 Jiang Yi said disdainfully, “Give me time and I’ll become the strongest existence in the calamity!”
nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎 The Black Hell Chicken said angrily, “The previous generation’s strongest has died. Do you also want to follow in his footsteps? You don’t even seem to be able to defeat the Great Freedom Golden Crow Divine Emperor!”
 Jiang Yi’s expression instantly turned ashen.
 This matter had always been a pain in his heart. Ever since the Black Hell Chicken learned of it, it had always used this matter to hurt him. It was too detestable.
 Murong Qi suddenly sighed. “The Immortal World is so chaotic. I wonder how Fang Liang is doing.” At the mention of Fang Liang, the other disciples also sighed. They were all angry with Fang Liang for not coming back with Murong?Qi.
 At the same time.
 In the Connate Cave Abode, Han Jue was still comprehending the Supreme Dao technique.
 Under the sensing of the Great Dao, countless inspirations gathered in his mind and gradually formed the Mystical Power he wanted. It was complicated and mysterious, causing him to sink into it.
