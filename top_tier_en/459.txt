 “I still have to be careful. How can I fight with the Sages? Unless I can insta-kill them, I can only fight with them. Before that, I can’t have any such intentions. It’s easy to be discovered.
 “The Dao Ancestor is my role model. He was already invincible when he appeared.” Han Jue adjusted his state of mind.
 It had to be said that Qiu Xilai’s words were too bewitching. Not to mention him, anyone else wouldn’t be able to withstand it.
 Han Jue decided that he couldn’t compete with them before surpassing the Heavenly Dao Sage level.
 Before that, he had to maintain a low profile cultivation attitude.
 Then, Han Jue continued cultivating.
 He had to break through to the late-stage Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm before he could break through to the Pseudo-Sage realm.
 Ten years went by quickly.
 A pillar of light suddenly descended on the Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain. Han Jue, who was in the cave abode, was also enveloped by the strong light.
 [Detected that the Heavenly Dao Immeasurable Calamity has ended and the Heavenly Dao has restarted. You have obtained the providence of the Immeasurable Emperor. You have the following choices:]
 (1: Return to the Heavenly Dao Immortal World and make preparations to become a legend in the future. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment and a chance to activate a new function of the system.]
 (2: Never return to the Immortal World. Stay in the Dark Forbidden Zone. You can obtain a Mystical Power inheritance and a Great Dao Fragment.]
 Immeasurable Emperor?
 Han Jue decided not to choose for the time being. He would choose when he returned to the Immortal World. The new function of the system was too attractive.
 He placed his attention on the Immeasurable Emperor title.
 The Immeasurable Emperor title meant that he had already entered the calamity and could be considered to have survived.
 “What’s the use of the Immeasurable Emperor’s providence?”
 [It can help you resist the bewitchment of the Heavenly Dao’s negative karma. You won’t lose your mind in the next Immeasurable Calamity.)
 That’s it?
 Han Jue secretly felt disdain.
 Han Jue checked his interpersonal relationships and discovered that Zhao Xuanyuan, Dao Sovereign, Jiang Yi, Murong Qi, Xing Hongxuan, Fang Liang, Ji Xianshen, Su Qi, Huang Zuntian, and the others had also obtained the title of Immeasurable Emperor.
 Almost all the existences who survived the calamity obtained the providence of the Immeasurable Emperor.
 People like the Black Hell Chicken and Xun Chang’an, who had been staying in the Dao Field, did not obtain it. Because after the calamity started, they did not go out at all.
 “The Dark Forbidden Zone doesn’t belong to the Heavenly Dao. How can the providence of the Heavenly Dao reach me?”
 Han Jue was secretly surprised. The ability of the Heavenly Dao was really strange.
 Wait!
 “Does the Immeasurable Emperor’s providence come from the Heavenly Dao or the Great Dao?” Han Jue asked in his mind.
 (5 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [Great Dao]
 I knew it!
 The Great Dao was everywhere, higher than the Heavenly Dao!
 Although the Dark Forbidden Zone was far from the Heavenly Dao, it was also under the Great Dao.
 Han Jue continued to ask, “If I return to the Heavenly Dao now, will I be killed by a Sage?”
 (4 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 (Detected that the order of the Heavenly Dao has been restored and the restrictions on the Heavenly Dao Sages have also been restored. The Sages can’t enter the myriad worlds with their true body and can’t directly kill the living beings in the Heavenly Dao. Otherwise, they will suffer a backlash from the Heavenly Dao.]
 No wonder the Sages all moved in the calamity. They usually stayed in the 33rd Heaven. It was because of the Heavenly Dao’s rules.
 He really couldn’t be a Heavenly Dao Sage!
 Although they became undying, they also lost their freedom.
 Then again, if the Heavenly Dao Sages couldn’t attack under the Heavenly Dao, could they attack in the Dark Forbidden Zone?
 Was the Dark Forbidden Zone even more dangerous?
 Han Jue decided to return after reaching the Perfected Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm.
 Before the calamity started again, even if a Sage wanted to kill him, they could only ask other mighty figures to help. However, a Pseudo-Sage couldn’t enter his Dao Field.
 Han Jue said, “Everyone, hurry up and cultivate. After some time, prepare to return to the Immortal World.”
 His voice resounded throughout the Dao Field.
 Hearing this, everyone became excited, and some were nervous.
 “We’re finally going back.”
 “Could it be that the calamity has ended?”
 “That’s right. I just obtained great providence and learned that the calamity has ended.”
 “This calamity was really fast. It’s unprecedented.”
 “Only a few thousand years? It’s very likely that Sages were involved.”
 “There’s no choice. Sages are too powerful. Once they enter the calamity, how can all living beings play?”
 After confirming that he was prepared to return to the Immortal World, Han Jue sped up his cultivation.
 It had been more than five hundred years since the last breakthrough. According to the time, he was about to break through.
 The Zenith Heaven Realm was really difficult to cultivate.
 Han Jue couldn’t imagine how determined those cultivators who used millions, tens of millions, or even hundreds of millions of years to break through a minor realm were.
 After Su Qi used the Dao Destruction Mystical Power, Han Jue’s emails became much quieter. He might not even receive an email per year.
 It was really quiet after the calamity ended.
 Time passed quickly.
 Ninety-seven years later, Han Jue finally had the chance to break through.
 It took him six years to break through.
 [Name: Han Jue]
 [Race: Primordial Fiendcelestial (Immeasurable Emperor)]
 (Cultivation: Perfected Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm]
 (Technique: Primordial Chaos Reincarnation Great Dao, Heavenly Cycle Body Tempering]
 (Great Dao: Great Dao of Life and Death, Great Dao of Karma)
 His lifespan had broken through again!
 Over 100 quintillion!
 Han Jue was in a good mood. The lifespan he had squandered previously had all been refreshed.
 He wondered if he could reach the Pseudo-Sage Realm before reaching ten thousand years old.
 Han Jue began to consolidate his cultivation.
 After spending five years, he completely stabilized his cultivation level and began to improve his Sword Dao Mystical Powers.
 Half a year later, Han Jue’s various Sword Dao Mystical Powers reached their limits. All of them reached the Pseudo-Sage level!
 His Mystical Powers had already reached the level of a Pseudo-Sage. He only needed to increase his cultivation level.
 Han Jue began to cultivate the Grand Unity Aspect.
 The sixth Fiendcelestial Dharma Idol was the Scarlet Clear Fiendcelestial. It possessed the power of the sun and could burn all things!
 The seventh Fiendcelestial Dharma idol was the Weak Water Fiendcelestial. This water was extremely heavy and could sink all existences!
 The eighth Fiendcelestial Dharma idol, the Extreme Darkness Fiendcelestial, possessed the Great Dao of Darkness and could envelop all the senses of living beings with darkness!
 In two years, Han Jue cultivated three Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols. After that, he didn’t obtain the cultivation memories of the ninth Fiendcelestial Dharma Idol.
 With eight fiendcelestials attacking together, who could compete with him?
 Han Jue began the simulation trial. This time, he was really invincible below the Sages.
 However, he couldn’t insta-kill existences whose cultivation had reached the late-stage Pseudo-Sage.
 For example, Shi Dudao. Han Jue fought for five minutes before killing him.
 Shi Dudao could devour all Mystical Powers, but he couldn’t devour the power of the Great Dao. He still had a defensive Supreme Treasure. The eight Chaotic Fiendcelestials surrounded him for five minutes before he exploded into nothingness.
 As for Li Daokong and the others, they had already been insta-killed by Han Jue.
T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by nov(ê(l)biin.co/m No one below the Sages should be able to kill him.
 Of course, this was only Han Jue’s guess. After all, he was referencing the listeners of the Great Ultimate Hall. Perhaps there were many powerful existences hidden in the Heavenly Dao or other Heavenly Dao worlds.
 No matter what, Han Jue could return to the Immortal World now!
 He immediately controlled Hidden Sect Island to fly to the Immortal World. In the Dark Forbidden Zone, his senses could not work. However, he could sense the Six Paths Insignia. Fang Liang, Huang Zuntian, and the others had Six Paths Insignia in their souls. They were all in the same direction, probably the Immortal World.
 “Is it dangerous for me to return to the Immortal World now?” Han Jue asked in his mind.
 (2 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [Not for the time being.]
 Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief.
 After all, on the surface, he no longer had any enemies. Other than Sage Fated Secrets, almost all the people who hated him were dead.
