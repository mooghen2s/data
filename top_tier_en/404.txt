 Han Jue was fighting with a Sage. It had to be said.
 How exciting!
 The Dao Field could now block the prying of Sages. Why was Han Jue afraid?
 He didn’t want to fight Jade Emperor Zhou Yan face to face.
 However, the most important thing now was to reach the Zenith Heaven Realm first!
 “Myriad worlds, all living beings of the Heavenly Dao, wait for me to break through!” Han Jue thought heroically as he continued to comprehend the Great Dao of Life and Death.
 Outside the Immortal World, on an island.
 Li Daokong sat under a tree, meditating. He circulated his energy to heal his injuries. Beside him stood two figures. They were Li Xuan’ao and Huang Jihao.
 Huang Jihao looked at Li Daokong’s pale face and was secretly shocked.
 This was the first time he had seen Li Daokong injured.
 Previously, in his heart, Li Daokong was an invincible existence. Even his master, Li Xuan’ao, was firmly suppressed by the former.
 Li Xuan’ao asked, “Senior, are you returning to Kunlun?”
 Li Daokong didn’t even look up. “Why?”
 Li Xuan’ao frowned and said, “The Heavenly Court is being controlled by Jade Emperor Zhou Yan. There’s no need to support it anymore.”
 “This is not for the Heavenly Court, but for the Human School.”
 “What do you mean? Do you still want to fight with Jade Emperor Zhou Yan? He’s a Pseudo-Sage. How long have you been in the Zenith Heaven Realm?”
 “Why not?”
 “But…”
 “Hmph, if not for him manipulating the Heavenly Emperor to ambush me, how could I have lost?”
CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m Li Daokong opened his eyes. His gaze became unprecedentedly sharp.
 Li Xuan’ao hesitated.
 Li Daokong glanced at him and said, “I know what you want to say. I also know that it’s the Immeasurable Calamity now. If I’m not careful, my body and soul will be destroyed. I’ll be doomed forever. But I want to fight. Who does Jade Emperor Zhou Yan think he is?”
 Li Xuan’ao said helplessly, “Senior Brother, put away your arrogance. We’re really not Jade Emperor Zhou Yan’s match.”
 Li Daokong closed his eyes again and said, “Junior, do you know the greatest difference between us?”
 “What’s the difference?”
 “You do what you know you can do, but I do what I know I cannot do.”
 Li Xuan’ao frowned and said, “Am I not as good as you?”
 Li Daokong didn’t say anything else.
 Li Xuan’ao glared at Huang Jihao and asked, “Disciple, what do you think?”
 Huang Jihao secretly complained. Although he admired Li Daokong’s heroism, he didn’t feel that Li Xuan’ao’s path was bad.
 He had seen people more cautious than Li Xuan’ao.
 He even felt that Li Xuan’ao was not worthy of Li Daokong’s evaluation.
 Huang Jihao organized his words. “Everyone has their own strengths.”
 Li Xuan’ao snorted unhappily.
 He turned to look at Li Daokong and frowned. A look of worry flashed across his eyes.
 He knew that he couldn’t persuade his senior brother.
 Ever since he was young, no one had been able to change Li Daokong’s will, not even their master, a Sage.
 At this moment, Li Xuan’ao was a little dazed.
 He suddenly understood why Li Daokong was the eldest disciple and why he always walked ahead of him.
 He couldn’t help but be confused.
 Was he wrong?
 Another twenty years passed.
 Han Jue stopped comprehending the Dao and took out the Book of Misfortune to curse Jade Emperor Zhou Yan.
 He had to curse him every five years to prevent him from successfully slaughtering the world. [Your good friend Li Daokong was attacked by your enemy Jade Emperor Zhou Yan.]
 [Your good friend Zhou Fan has fused with the blood of the Golden Crow Ancestor and obtained the Golden Crow Dharma Idol. He has obtained the providence of the Golden Crow Divine Clan.)
 (Your grand-disciple Fang Liang’s soul has transcended into the primordial era.)
 (Your good friend Li Daokong was attacked by your enemy Jade Emperor Zhou Yan.]
 (Your good friend Pan Xin has awakened a Mystical Power. His providence has increased greatly.]
 (Your good friend Li Daokong has obtained a Supreme Treasure. His providence has increased greatly.]
 (Your good friend Li Daokong was attacked by your enemy Jade Emperor Zhou Yan.]
 (Your good friend Li Daokong was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure) x13 [Your good friend Li Daokong was severely injured. Fortunately, a Sage made a move and his soul escaped.]
 Han Jue was secretly shocked. Li Daokong had entered the calamity.
 He couldn’t defeat Jade Emperor Zhou Yan but still fought so crazily?
 Of course, there was another possibility. He was being chased by Jade Emperor Zhou Yan.
 Han Jue also noticed that Fang Liang’s soul had passed through the primordial era again.
 What did this kid do every time he went back?
 Han Jue didn’t think further. He would curse Jade Emperor Zhou Yan first.
 He would directly offer 20 billion years of lifespan. Be polite!
 Half a month later.
 Han Jue put down the Book of Misfortune and asked in his heart, “I want to know what Fang Liang’s soul did in the past.”
 [Ten billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Ten billion years?
 So much?
 What was this fellow plotting?
 Han Jue was shocked. He had to continue!
 Continue!
 [Too much karma is involved and cannot be deduced in one attempt. The price of lifespan you paid will be refunded.]
 Eh?
 Can’t deduce?
 Han Jue had to change his method. “Will Fang Liang’s soul transmigrating into the primordial era harm me?”
 (3 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?] Continue!
 [It won’t harm you.]
 Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief. He had to be cautious. Although Fang Liang’s favorability towards him had not decreased, after so many years, there was no knowing what others were thinking. He had to be careful.
 Han Jue stopped deducing and focused on breaking through. Relying on the Stellar Primordial Body and the Great Dao cultivation technique, the Primordial Chaos Reincarnation Great Dao, Han Jue’s comprehension speed was very fast. He estimated that he wasn’t far from reaching the Zenith Heaven Realm.
 Without reaching this realm, he would never have the right to compete with Jade Emperor Zhou Yan.
 Immortal World, Human Race.
 In a vast arena, countless human cultivators gathered.
 Xing Hongxuan was among them. She was surrounded by female cultivators with extraordinary auras. All the cultivators looked up at the sky. A huge painting hung upside down above the sea of clouds. The painting depicted a mountain and river. It was vivid, and there were all sorts of immortal birds flying past. It was like a paradise.
 “Children of the Human Race, the Immortal World is facing a calamity and all living beings are in danger. How can we cultivators stay on the ground? We should fight in the sky and save the trapped immortals!”
 An ancient voice sounded, causing the blood of most human cultivators to boil.
 Xing Hongxuan frowned. Something was wrong.
 Were they courting death again?
 She had also heard of what had happened to the Heavenly Court.
 The Primordial Heavenly Emperor had appeared out of nowhere. Even the immortals had been suppressed. How could the humans resist the powerful Primordial Heavenly Emperor?
 Previously, they had been enemies with the Heavenly Court, but now, they wanted to save them…
 Xing Hongxuan couldn’t understand what the human leaders were thinking.
 She had to think of a way to avoid this!
 Twenty years later.
 Han Jue succeeded in comprehending the Dao and began to fuse with the Great Dao of Life and Death. He imprinted it in his Dharmic powers and made his Dharmic powers transform and his soul sublimate.
 When everything he had fused with the Great Dao, he would condense a Zenith Heaven Dao Fruit and become a Zenith Heaven cultivator.
 According to the notification of the Primordial Chaos Reincarnation Great Dao, the Zenith Heaven Realm stood above the Laws of the heavens. It pierced through space and time, invincible and indestructible.
 The tribulation here referred to the Heavenly Tribulation. If he encountered an even stronger existence, that would be fate.
 [Detected that a mysterious existence is influencing your fate. Do you want to resist?] Han Jue was stunned.
 He subconsciously wanted to choose “Yes”. But on second thought, he asked, “Is it good or bad?”
 (Uncertain for now.]
 “Resist!”
 Han Jue immediately made his choice.
