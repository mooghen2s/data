 Han Jue continued cultivating and made progress towards the mid-stage Primordial Chaos Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm.
 On the other side.
 In the 33rd Heaven, at the edge of Chaos, a lofty city stood in the darkness. Fog curled around it.
 Chaotic City.
 There was a tall tower in the city. At the top of the tower was a palace where all the Sages gathered.
 “Han Jue sent a Zenith Heaven disciple here,” Qiu Xilai said.
 The other Sages nodded.
 The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate clicked his tongue in wonder. “The Hidden Sect casually sent out a Zenith Heaven. Li Daokong is already the strongest in the Immortal World. At this rate, the Hidden Sect will dominate sooner or later.”
 Sect Master Tian Jue said calmly, “Isn’t it good for them to dominate alone? This way, we can put away our ambition and cultivate in peace. It’s just nice that we will support the Hidden Sect in the next calamity. If the Heavenly Dao is in danger in the future, Han Jue can also directly attack.”
 Fuxitian and Emperor Xiao nodded.
 The Heavenly Devil Calamity caused their cultivation levels to decrease greatly. They needed a long time to recover.
 Qiu Xilai smiled and said, “Perhaps this is a good thing. At least, we can put down our grudges. We can take care of that Hidden Sect disciple more as a form of goodwill. The matter of the Heavenly Devil also showed that Han Jue is not the Dark Forbidden Lord. With his strength, he could have waited for the Dao Heavenly Devil to kill us before attacking. The Dao Heavenly Devil was completely not his match.”
 The other four Sages still sighed.
 The Dao Heavenly Devil was not Han Jue’s match at all.
 Sect Master Tian Jue’s eyes flickered. “In that case, it can only be Li Muyi.”
 The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate snorted. “Right? He didn’t even ask the two of us when he used the Three Pure Sacred Ancestor. The three schools of the Dao Sect are all bullshit. Besides, if the Heavenly Dao is gone, the greatest beneficent will be his Chiliocosm World. The Little Heavenly Dao will become the only Heavenly Dao.”
 The Sages were unhappy when Li Muyi was mentioned.
 Emperor Xiao said, “Let’s not talk about Li Muyi. Let’s talk about the Chaotic City. Ever since the Heavenly Devils were eradicated, many spatial cracks have appeared in the chaos. I’m worried that the Inauspicious Evil will take the opportunity to infiltrate.”
 Sect Master Tian Jue shook his head. “Sage Jin’an has a Mystical Power that can spy on the Inauspicious Evil. However, he has already gone mad.”
 Qiu Xilai frowned.
 He felt like an invisible hand was pushing all of this from behind.
 When they needed something, they discovered that they had long been plotted against by the mysterious enemy.
 It was all connected!
 Qiu Xilai had never been so helpless. He felt that the enemy had already set up traps for him to jump into.
 “We have to increase the Immortal World’s strength. We can’t just rely on ourselves.” The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate suddenly suggested.
 Qiu Xilai narrowed his eyes. “Why don’t we preach? The Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity is coming. We can’t stay passive anymore.”
 “Sure!”
 “Alright!”
 The Sages agreed.
 In the Daoist temple, Han Jue received four favorability notifications. The Sages who were still well had become his good friends.
 This was in line with reality. The Sages weren’t stupid. How could they keep plotting when they couldn’t win?
 Han Jue didn’t reject their hypocrisy. It just so happened that he could reduce some trouble and cultivate in peace.
 The Sages’ existence was still necessary. Although they fought openly and secretly, they could indeed maintain the order of the Immortal World and even protect it.
 Time passed silently.
 Year after year passed.
 Three hundred years later.
 While cultivating, Han Jue began to observe Su Qi in the Primordial World.
 Su Qi’s body had already completely condensed, but he was still curled up in the Fiendcelestial Qi, absorbing the surrounding Chaotic Qi and nebulous Primordial Qi.
 The Chaotic Qi was born from the Chaotic Origin Stone. The nebulous Primordial Qi was born from Han Jue’s Primordial Fiendcelestial Physique.
 Apart from Su Qi, the other Fiendcelestial Qi did not condense into a body for the time being.
 Su Qi was currently in a healthy development state. There should be no more problems.
 Han Jue looked at the Reroll World.
 He had wanted to turn the Reroll World into the first world of the Primordial World, but it was somewhat unbearable with the nebulous Primordial Qi’s pressure.
 Han Jue decided to let the Reroll World out and become a huge world below the Immortal World.
 After thinking, he took out the Reroll World and let it float above his hand.
 He jumped out of the Immortal World and arrived below it.
 With a sweep of his Sage Sense, he could already see more than five thousand small worlds below the Immortal World.
 Han Jue put down the Reroll World and obtained a portion of the Heavenly Dao merit from the Primordial World to fuse with the Heavenly Dao providence.
 The Reroll World began to rapidly expand.
 Han Jue sent a voice transmission to the White-Robed Buddha asking him to be prepared.
 The White-Robed Buddha asked nervously, “Then, are we still considered part of the Hidden Sect in the future?”
 “Yes, the Reroll World is the Hidden Sect’s first world.”
 “Alright!”
 The White-Robed Buddha heaved a sigh of relief. He wanted to cling to Han Jue.
 There was another reason why he released the Reroll World. Han Jue wanted to use it to fight for providence.
 At that time, the Heavenly Race would control the Immortal World and the Reroll World would control the mortal world. The Heavenly Dao’s providence would all belong to Han Jue, and the Heavenly Dao could forget about plotting against him.
 After the Reroll World completely fused with the Heavenly Dao Merit and the providence placed on the Heavenly Dao again, Han Jue returned to the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 He sent a voice transmission to the Three Pure Sacred Ancestor, telling him to infiltrate the Reroll World and protect it. In any case, this fellow had nothing to do.
 The Three Pure Sacred Ancestor immediately headed to the Reroll World.
 After doing all of this, Han Jue relaxed a lot.
 He began to look forward to the Reroll World’s future.
 It had to be said that the feeling of plotting was somewhat satisfying.
 Was this the reason why the Sages were so tireless?
 He continued to cultivate.
 Eight hundred years passed quickly. Han Jue finally broke through! Mid-stage Primordial Chaos Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm!
 His Dharmic powers began to increase!
 Han Jue checked his attributes panel as he consolidated his cultivation.
 [Name: Han Jue]
 [Race: Primordial Fiendcelestial (Immeasurable Emperor)]
 (Cultivation: Mid-stage Primordial Chaos Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm (Perfect Sage)]
 [Technique: Primordial Chaos Reincarnation Great Dao (Great Dao), Heavenly Cycle Body Tempering]
 [Great Dao: Great Dao of Life and Death, Great Dao of Karma, Great Dao of Extreme Origin]
 His lifespan had increased by nearly four times. Not bad!
 Next, Han Jue spent 70 years stabilizing his cultivation.
 His understanding of the Great Dao of Extreme Origin deepened. He even felt that he could use it to create a Mystical Power. Han Jue first spent half a year raising all the Sword Dao Mystical Powers to the limit. Just as he was about to continue cultivating the Grand Unity Aspect, a loud and solemn voice resounded through the world.
Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m “We Sages have decided to choose a new Sage in ten thousand years. This Sage needs to possess great merit and cultivation. Regardless of sect or race, all living beings can fight for it!”
 Fuxitian’s voice sounded.
 They were going to choose a new Sage so quickly?
 Han Jue wasn’t interested. No matter who became a new Sage, they couldn’t defeat him!
 Wait!
 Where did this Primordial Purple Qi come from?
 Han Jue checked his emails and indeed, he saw an email.
 [Your enemy, Sage Fated Secrets, was killed by the Sages, who severed the providence of the Heavenly Dao.]
 Sage Fated Secrets’s portrait had already disappeared.
