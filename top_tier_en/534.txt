 After hearing Li Muyi’s words, his first reaction was, “What’s wrong with this old fellow?”
 Why did he think that Han Jue would help him?
 Seeing through his thoughts, Li Muyi said, “If you help me, from now on, if the Sages dare to scheme against you, I will firmly support you. I will also introduce you to the ancestors of the Human School. If you have the chance in the future, you can go listen to the Great Dao.”
 Even Nüwa could transcend the Heavenly Dao. Han Jue had long suspected that the Sages of the past had already stepped into a higher realm. As the first providence sect, the Human School’s foundation was naturally unfathomable.
 However, this wasn’t enough to move Han Jue.
 After all, he had to take risks!
 Han Jue said, “I’ll consider it.”
 Li Muyi frowned. From his understanding of this fellow, thinking about it meant rejecting him.
 He asked, “What do you want? Tell me.”
 Han Jue said, “I don’t want anything. I’ve just attained the Dao not long ago. I have to deal with enemies that you can’t even deal with. I still have to be wary of your junior brothers launching a sneak attack on my Dao Field at any time. They’re forcing me.”
 Li Muyi felt awkward.
 The atmosphere became deathly silent.
 Li Muyi was speechless.
 Han Jue said, “Let me think about it. This is very important. If it were you, you wouldn’t have agreed directly, right?”
 “Fine,” Li Muyi said helplessly.
 The dream ended.
 Han Jue’s consciousness returned to reality. He began to derive, “I want to know who the enemy Li Muyi is talking about is?”
 [Ten billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 A figure appeared in Han Jue’s mind. This person wore a black Daoist robe. His sleeves fluttered and his long hair was like a waterfall. There was a vertical eye between his eyebrows.
 (Dark Sage King: Cultivation unknown, Chaotic Fiendcelestial]
 Chaotic Fiendcelestial!
 Goodness!
 He couldn’t provoke this guy!
 The unknown cultivation meant that it was at least higher than Han Jue’s cutivation.
 Perhaps he could defeat the other party, but the other party had a chance to kill him.
 If he couldn’t kill him instantly, he couldn’t be his enemy.
 Han Jue put this matter aside for the time being and ignored it. “Arrange for the disciples to go out later. They can’t go to Li Muyi’s Chiliocosm World.”
 Han Jue thought silently. As for Li Muyi’s dreams in the future, he would ignore them.
 He wasn’t afraid of offending him. When the Dark Sage King succeeded, Li Muyi’s cultivation would definitely plummet. He might even be severely injured and become the weakest Sage.
 These Sages who relied on the providence of the Heavenly Dao had unstable foundations.
 They were nothing to fear!
 Time passed.
 A piece of news suddenly spread throughout the Immortal World, shaking the world.
 The Heavenly Court defeated the Dragon Race, and from then on, they became a subordinate of the Heavenly Court. This Dragon Race included the True Dragon Race and other dragons.
 After the Heavenly Dao restarted, the Dragon Race also appeared. They relied on their powerful physical potential to dominate the sea and had extremely high prestige.
 The submission of the Dragon Race caused all living beings to look at the Heavenly Court. It was the orthodox lineage of the Immortal Gods!
 While everyone was shocked by the Heavenly Court’s strength, the isolated Hundred Peak Immortal River was calm and peaceful.
 In the blink of an eye, another five hundred years passed.
 Han Jue had just finished his lecture when he taught the Invocation Technique to the million living beings in the Hidden Sect. He declared that this Mystical Power was a secret technique and was not allowed to be used. If they used it recklessly, they would suffer a backlash.
 All the disciples believed Han Jue’s words.
 Only a few personal disciples had used the Invocation Technique, so most of the disciples still had reverence for it.
 Han Jue came in front of the Fusang Tree and let it open up more than a hundred spatial vortexes.
 He scanned with his divine sense. These spacetime continuums were of different strengths. The strongest was still Li Muyi’s Chiliocosm World.
Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m Among them, six worlds did not have the providence of the Heavenly Dao and were not controlled by the Heavenly Dao.
 After observing, Han Jue made a decision.
 After returning to the Daoist temple, he continued cultivating.
 Ten years later.
 Han Zuitian brought a thousand in-name disciples to the Fusang Tree. These in-name disciples had already reached the Emperor Realm and could no longer increase their cultivation.
 The Fusang Tree opened a spatial vortex and said, “Enter from here.”
 The empty vortex was chosen by Han Jue previously. It wasn’t too strong or too weak. If a thousand Immortal Emperors entered, they could at least dominate an area.
 Han Zuitian turned around and looked at the thousand in-name disciples. “After we arrive, find a place to take root and understand the situation of this world before making plans.”
 The disciples nodded. Then, under Han Zuitian’s guidance, they jumped into the spatial vortex.
 This batch of disciples was considered the top among the in-name disciples. Their departure was also a huge matter, causing the other disciples to discuss.
 Han Jue didn’t hide the fact that they were going outside the Heavenly Dao. It was a good opportunity to stimulate the sect and make the disciples more united.
 Several months later.
 Han Jue received Li Muyi’s dream notification again. This time, he ignored it.
 Li Muyi kept spamming the dreams. Han Jue wasn’t in a breakthrough state, so the system didn’t block it for him.
 After a month, Li Muyi gave up.
 (Li Muyi’s hatred towards you has increased. Current Hatred Points: 4 stars]
 Han Jue didn’t care at all.
 Since Li Muyi couldn’t protect himself, he had no time to take revenge.
 Several months passed.
 Li Daokong came to visit him.
 “Sect Master, I want to go out and train. I want to imitate Shi Dudao and challenge the mighty figures!” Li Daokong said with a firm gaze.
 Han Jue asked, “Aren’t you afraid of Sages?”
 “As long as I don’t leave the Heavenly Dao, Sages can’t personally attack me. What I want to do is become the strongest Pseudo-Sage. I just need the Sages to pressure me and force me to grow.”
 “Have you thought about it?” Han Jue asked seriously. Li Daokong was already a Pseudo-Sage and met the requirements to go out.
 Li Daokong nodded.
 Han Jue said, “I’ll teach you a Mystical Power to help you become an invincible Pseudo-Sage!”
 He raised his hand and pointed. The inherited memories surged into Li Daokong’s mind.
 Great Dao Mystical Power, Ten Thousand Life Sword!
 Everything in the world could become a sword!
 This was Han Jue’s strongest Sword Dao Mystical Power.
 Several days later.
 Li Daokong opened his eyes and exclaimed, “This Mystical Power…”
 Han Jue said calmly, “…was created by me. You are the second person to grasp it.”
 Li Daokong’s expression changed. He immediately knelt down and kowtowed.
 “Sect Master, I will never forget your kindness. I will fight for the Hidden Sect even if my body and soul are destroyed in this life!”
 [Li Daokong’s favorability towards you has increased. Current favorability: 6 stars]
 The Ten Thousand Life Sword was too powerful. He had never cultivated such a Mystical Power and had never even seen it.
 Han Jue could teach him this Mystical Power, which was no different from treating him as a direct disciple.
 At this moment, Li Daokong’s feelings for Han Jue completely changed. He became like his personal disciples.
 Han Jue said, “Daokong, don’t disappoint me. I look forward to your achievements the most. If the Hidden Sect gives birth to a second Sage, I feel and hope that it will be you.”
 “I won’t let Sect Master down!”
 “Go. Make a name for yourself before coming back.”
 “Yes!”
 With that, Li Daokong was moved out of the Hundred Peak Immortal River by Han Jue.
 He floated high in the sky. Under the sunlight, his white robe fluttered in the wind. A proud expression appeared on his handsome face again. “With this Mystical Power, I will definitely be invincible in the Immortal World!
 “Shi Dudao, are you ready?”
