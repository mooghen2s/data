 Looking at the line of words that suddenly appeared in front of him, Han Jue felt baffled.
 But since it was a favorability notice, it was fine.
 If it was Hatred Points, Di Lantian would be in trouble!
 He continued to cultivate.
Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates Time flew.
 Ten years had passed since he had imparted the Mystical Power to the Han brothers.
 Han Jue stood up and walked out of the cave abode, preparing to preach the Dao for the Hidden Sect.
 Fang Liang, Su Qi, and Long Hao broke through at lightning speed outside. He couldn’t let the disciples who stayed on the island fall behind. In that case, when Su Qi and the other two returned, how much of a blow would that cause to the remaining disciples? Han Jue couldn’t allow such a situation to happen!
 “Everyone, prepare to listen!”
 Han Jue’s voice resounded throughout the entire island. The Nether Race beings scattered throughout Hidden Sect Island became excited.
 They had always missed Han Jue’s lecture. The feeling of the Dao Insight exploding was unforgettable. Everyone quickly sat down. Even Fairy Xi Xuan and Chang Yue’er walked out of their cave abodes.
 Han Jue began to preach.
 He glanced at Chang Yue’er. This senior sister had been in seclusion. In the past few hundred years, other than to hear him preach, she rarely came out. He didn’t know what she was studying
 Chang Yue’er’s cultivation level could barely keep up. She was already a Grand Unity Heaven Immortal.
 Han Jue was only slightly curious and couldn’t be bothered to spend time observing her. As Han Jue spoke, everyone entered a state of Dao comprehension.
 This lecture lasted for five years.
 After the lecture, Han Jue directly entered the Connate Cave Abode to cultivate. The disciples and Nether Race members had yet to recover.
 Han Jue sat on the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus and fell into a daze.
 His eyes could see everyone’s state through the mountain wall of the cave abode. Some were crying in joy, some had worried expressions, some were impatient, and some had dark expressions. They were all comprehending the Dao for themselves.
 Han Jue saw all forms of life.
 When immortals were high up and looked down on the mortal world, would they be moved by the suffering of mortals? Looking back, Han Jue’s thoughts drifted to the herb garden of the outer sect of the Jade Pure Sacred Sect in the mortal world. He followed the servants to cultivate and take care of the herbs.
 He saw Elder Iron. He was still so cold and gave off a temperamental aura.
 He saw his parents in this life. For some reason, their faces were already blurry.
 Han Jue had clearly lived two lifetimes. At this current strength, his memory was not ordinary. He could remember everyone but his parents.
 Perhaps he didn’t want to remember them because he did not acknowledge them deep down.
 Time passed quickly. The faces Han Jue encountered in this life flashed past his eyes. It was like a movie that was being sped up. Everything flashed like a shadow.
 Some were smiling, some were angry, and some had jealousy in their eyes.
 Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. They were all things of the past.
 Han Jue sighed in his heart. Gradually, his eyes became firm.
 Wasn’t this what he wanted to pursue?
 He wanted to be indestructible and undying!
 He wanted to surpass all cultivators and become the strongest!
 “This is life and death. Life and death restrain all living beings. All living beings face life and death,” Han Jue muttered to himself. His Divine Origin Dharmic powers resonated and his cultivation level began to increase.
 This was a form of Dao Comprehension!
 Sometimes, suddenly understanding the true meaning of heaven and earth and the truth of the Great Dao could increase one’s cultivation. Han Jue often saw this in his emails.
 Unfortunately, the increase in cultivation did not last long. He still had to work hard to break through to the Five Mystic Divine Origin.
 Han Jue adjusted his state of mind and continued cultivating.
 Ten years later.
 Han Jue checked his emails while cultivating.
 [Your disciple Long Hao was attacked by your good friend Divine General. He was severely injured.]
 [Your good friend Di Lantian was attacked by your good friend Li Daokong.]
 (Your good friend Huang Jihao was attacked by the True Dragon Race) x10827
 [Your good friend Ji Xianshen was attacked by your disciple Long Hao.]
 [Your good friend Heavenly Emperor was attacked by your good friend Di Lantian.)
 (Your good friend Di Lantian sacrificed his soul to summon the Golden Crow Ancestor.]
 (Your good friend Di Lantian has sounded the Heavenly Dao Supreme Treasure, the Emperor Ancestral Bell. The providence of the Heavenly Court has been damaged.]
 (Your good friend Jing Tiangong has been cursed too many times and has been plagued by bad luck.)
 (Your good friend Jiang Dugu was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure and was suppressed in a danger zone.)
 Long Hao finally fought with the Heavenly Emperor!
 Han Jue sighed.
 It was truly tragic for the father and son to fight. The Golden Crow Divine Clan was quite something. From the emails, they were on par with the Heavenly Court. Especially Di Lantian, he could actually rely on a Supreme Treasure to destroy the providence of the Heavenly Court!
 Han Jue also noticed Jiang Dugu’s situation and saw that he finally suffered a failure.
 What kind of existence was this?
 If it was a Sage, it should be shown.
 It seemed that Jiang Dugu was not the strongest below the Sages.
 As Han Jue continued reading, his blood boiled.
 Was this the Immeasurable Calamity?
 How exciting!
 If only there was a live stream. Han Jue was just thinking. He didn’t want to go out.
 This calamity was not the era where he would rule. He wanted to be invisible.
 After resting for a few days, Han Jue continued cultivating
 Ever since the end of the lecture ten years ago, the Hidden Sect had once again stirred up a trend of seclusion.
 It was mainly because Li Yao was preparing to reach the Emperor Realm.
 She especially headed to the back of a mountain to sit alone and not be disturbed.
 Li Yao was a latecomer. Murong Qi, Xun Chang’an, the Black Hell Chicken, and the others did not want to be left behind by her.
 Even Jiang Yi was stimulated by Li Yao. This woman’s talent was really high. It was worth mentioning that the Chaotic Gourd Spirit, Han Eight, had also risen. Ever since he finished listening to the lecture, he seemed to have been enlightened. His cultivation progressed at a tremendous pace. Even Chu Shiren sighed.
 In the blink of an eye.
 Another ten years passed.
 Duan Hongchen suddenly visited him.
 Han Jue thought for a moment and still let him in.
 [Duan Hongchen: Rank Three Immortal Emperor. Born in the face of calamity. Reincarnated Ancient God. He once participated in the Immeasurable Calamity and died. His remnant soul was suppressed in the netherworld with negative karma. After countless years of evolution, his body was born from negative karma. His remnant soul gained intelligence and could absorb negative karma to become stronger. However, he can’t digest negative karma. Current favorability: 5 stars]
 After arriving at Hidden Sect Island, his cultivation level increased by two stages. It could be said to be fast.
 However, he seemed to be dissatisfied.
 After all, he was also someone facing calamity.
 Duan Hongchen knelt in front of Han Jue and gritted his teeth. “Sect Master, I want to enter the calamity. Recently, my cultivation has developed mental demons. I’m afraid it’s the Heavenly Dao’s fault. If I don’t enter the calamity, it’ll be difficult for my Dao heart to stabilize.
 “I swear that as long as I’m still alive, I’ll always be a disciple of the Hidden Sect. I won’t reveal anything about you or harm the Hidden Sect!”
 Saying this, he clearly mustered up a lot of courage. After all, he was once a prisoner and had no right to make any requests. Han Jue stared at him and didn’t reply immediately.
 The atmosphere was silent.
 Duan Hongchen couldn’t help but panic.
 Crap!
 The Sect Master is furious!
 Duan Hongchen gritted his teeth and didn’t dare to look at Han Jue.
 If this continued, he would be killed by the mental demon. It was better to risk it.
 “I know. Go.”
 Han Jue’s voice suddenly sounded. Duan Hongchen was stunned and thought that he had heard wrong.
 He looked up at Han Jue and discovered that he was smiling. He was like a completely different person.
 [Duan Hongchen’s favorability towards you has increased. Current favorability: 6 stars]
