 Han Jue’s eyelids twitched. This was a clone, not a Dharma Idol, let alone a reincarnation.
 In other words, Jade Bodhi’s main body was using Jie Yu’s perspective to stare at him?
 Han Jue pulled out his interpersonal relationships and found the Jade Bodhi.
 (Jade Bodhi: Cultivation unknown. Transcendent Dao Expert. The first Bodhi that cultivated to success under the Heavenly Dao. Primordial Ancestor of the Buddhist Sect. He has always lived in the Dark Forbidden Zone. Because you were praised by Ancestor Xitian, he has a favorable impression of you. Current favorability: 1 star.]
 After hearing the Dao in the Great Ultimate Hall, Ancestor Xitian, Dijun, Seven Dao Sage, and Jade Bodhi had a favorable impression of him. He thought that the four of them were playing mahjong.
 As a Transcendent Dao Expert, Jade Bodhi was definitely not inferior to a Great Dao Sage.
 Han Jue used the simulation trial to detect Jie Yu’s existence, but he didn’t look over.
 Jie Yu was a young man with a graceful appearance. He wore black hair and white clothes and was not considered outstanding in the crowd.
 Pretending not to see him, Han Jue asked Han Tuo with a smile, “Do you hate immortals?”
 Han Tuo replied, “It’s not hatred. I just feel that there’s no need for us humans to believe in immortals. When humans were in danger, the immortals and gods did not help. When humans were powerful, the immortals wanted their faith. I don’t like immortals or gods.”
 Han Jue sighed secretly. This kid was still not like him. It was not a good thing to speak without thinking.
 If he was too stubborn, he would easily cause trouble.
 Although Han Tuo had never relied on Han Jue all these years, he had more or less borrowed some of his influence. This was normal. How could one rely solely on themselves in life?

 “Why don’t we find a place to chat?” Han Jue asked with a smile.
 Han Tuo hesitated for a moment but still nodded.
 The other party had a mysterious background and had no ill intentions. It wasn’t a bad thing to befriend him.
 The father and son left.
 Han Jue was cautious and discovered that Jie Yu didn’t follow.
 The father and son came to an inn and began to talk freely. Their relationship became closer and closer.
 Coincidentally, two hours later, Jie Yu also arrived at the inn, at the table beside them.
 Han Jue pretended to ignore him.
 The father and son continued chatting.
 Han Tuo suddenly asked curiously, “Crouching Dragon, what’s your cultivation level?”
 Han Tuo had become an Immortal Emperor after cultivating for nine thousand years. He was also considered knowledgeable. This stinky monk in front of him was unfathomable. He was definitely not only a realm higher than him.
 Han Jue smiled and said, “My cultivation level is not important. We only met once. If you have no choice in the future, you can visit the Heavenly Court or the Heavenly Race. They will accept you.”
 With that, he stood up and prepared to leave.
 Han Tuo hurriedly stood up and asked, “You’re an Immortal God?”
 Han Jue disappeared after saying, “I’m neither an immortal nor a god. I’m just a spectator outside the mortal world.”
 Spectator?
 Han Tuo was impressed.
 At this moment.
 Jie Yu suddenly stood up and walked over with a smile. “Brother, can I join you?”
 Han Tuo looked at him and frowned.
 Why did another come after just one left?
 Han Jue returned to the Daoist temple and immediately asked silently, “Why did Jade Bodhi send Jie Yu to approach my son?”
 (160 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]

 Han Jue entered the illusion.
 He came to a vast and bright palace. The hall was surrounded by clouds, and golden light shone. He looked up and saw countless Buddhas. Some were lying on lotus thrones, some were leaning against ferocious beasts, some were reciting the scriptures with their eyes closed, and some were crying. All of them had their own expressions and postures.

Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com Han Jue’s gaze landed on the Jade Bodhi.
 Jade Bodhi was the only Daoist here. He sat on the 72nd-grade white lotus throne with a transcendent attitude.
 Han Jue showed a frown.
 What was this place?
 Buddhist Sect?
 A Buddhist Sect higher ranked than the Immortal World?
 Beside the Jade Bodhi was a majestic figure. His entire body emitted strong light, and one could only see his outline. It was a huge Buddha with a slightly thin figure.
 The thin giant Buddha said, “Recently, the Heavenly Dao’s providence has weakened and the Heavenly Devils caused chaos. Although the danger has been resolved, signs of the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity already appeared. What do you think?”
 The Buddhas began to reply.
 “Why care about the Heavenly Dao? It’s all superficial.”
 “There’s already more than one Heavenly Dao. We don’t have to keep it in mind.”
 “The Heavenly Dao is the beginning of everything. It’s the foundation of the Great Dao. We have to investigate it clearly.”
 “Does the so-called Primordial Fiendcelestial really exist?”
 “Several Chaotic Fiendcelestials have recently appeared in the Ancient Desolate. The era of the great battle is about to arrive. It’s not a good thing for us to pay attention to the Heavenly Dao now.”
 The Buddhas had their own opinions. Although they spoke one after another, there was no commotion. Instead, it made people inexplicably calm as if they were preaching.
 Jade Bodhi slowly said, “Leave this to me. You don’t have to care.”
 The Buddhas quietened down.
 The illusion shattered.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and frowned.
 The Ancient Desolate was in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End, which meant that the batch of Buddhas had come from there.
 So, Jie Yu’s arrival was to investigate the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity?
 “Fortunately, I suppressed Han Tuo’s bloodline and didn’t completely release it.” Han Jue thought silently.
 He began to observe Han Tuo and Jie Yu.
 The two of them sat at the table and started chatting
 In the future, the two of them became closer and closer. They even agreed to barge into the Immortal World together.
 Han Jue didn’t dare to act rashly and could only watch quietly.
 Three years later.
 Jie Yu and Han Tuo parted. The two of them were already close friends. However, Jie Yu still had something to do and bid Han Tuo farewell.
 Han Jue asked in his mind, “Does Jie Yu think that Han Tuo is a Primordial Fiendcelestial?”
 [Ten million years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [Not for the time being.]
 Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief.
 It was fine as long as he did not suspect Han Tuo.
 As for Han Jue, he wasn’t afraid of hiding in the Dao Field.
 Han Jue adjusted his state of mind and continued cultivating.
 In any case, it was still a long time away from the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity.
 Ever since the Sages announced that they were going to choose a new Sage, the entire Immortal World fell into a fanatical atmosphere.
 For the sake of great merit, almost all the mighty figures came out to set up schools, preach the Dao, establish order, create Mystical Powers, and so on. The Immortal World was blooming everywhere, greatly advancing the progress of the Heavenly Dao.
 The Hundred Peak Immortal River was still calm. They didn’t care about the Sage position. In any case, they couldn’t go out.
 A hundred years passed quickly.
 On this day, a deafening sound came from the
 sky.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and saw a huge three-legged Golden Crow leading countless Demon Soldiers and Demon Generals to the 13th Heaven.
 The Demon Race was fighting the Heavenly Race!
 Han Jue raised his eyebrows. Was this Three-legged Golden Crow stupid?
 It was directly challenging the Heavenly Dao Race!
 Han Jue pinched his fingers to deduce and his expression became strange.
 Ji Xianshen and his subordinates were not in the Heavenly Race. The immortals guarding the 13th Heaven were from other providence sects.
 Could it be that Ji Xianshen was colluding with the demons to kill them with a borrowed knife?
 Interesting
 Han Jue discovered that this group of demons had already reached a scale. There were more than ten million demon soldiers. Although most of their cultivation was weak, at least their momentum was impressive.
 The battle lasted for decades. In the end, both the demons and the Heavenly Race were injured.
 Instantly, the demons’ reputation soared! In the eyes of all living beings, the Heavenly Race was the strongest force!
 Han Jue saw that the water released by the Heavenly Race was about to turn into a sea. After the battle began, all existences above the Deity Realm retreated.
