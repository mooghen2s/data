 However, he spent eight hundred years just on the Three Pure Sacred Ancestor. How many cultivators were there in the Immortal World?
 Moreover, even if he enslaved the entire Immortal World, how beneficial was it to Han Jue?
 At this moment, the entire Immortal World would definitely lose if they attacked him. Why waste time and delay his cultivation?
 With the Three Pure Sacred Ancestor beside him, Han Jue couldn’t cultivate in peace.
 After thinking, he stood up.
 “That’s all. I should use the Primordial Heavenly Prison less. The more I use it, the easier it will be to expose myself. I have to use it when it’s most needed.”
 Han Jue thought silently. The system also had its limits. It wouldn’t be good if he encountered a powerful existence that far exceeded the system and the other party saw through it at a glance.
 After stretching, Han Jue walked out of the Daoist temple and summoned all the disciples to prepare for the lecture.
 After the Heavenly Devil Calamity ended, this was Han Jue’s first time preaching.
 The disciples were all very excited. They often heard the living beings near the Hundred Peak Immortal River praising Han Jue, causing them to want to see him again. However, over the years, even the personal disciples and Guardians couldn’t see him.
 It was still the same place as before. Han Jue sat on the mountain peak and waited for a while before starting the lecture.
 The disciples quickly entered a meditative state and began to comprehend the Dao.
 After preaching for a hundred years, the cycle of spring and autumn had changed. The world had changed again.
 After the lecture, Han Jue came to the Fusang Tree.
 He asked the Fusang Tree to open the spatial vortex that led to the Chiliocosm World for him to probe with his Sage Sense.
 The Chiliocosm World wasn’t attacked by Heavenly Devils. Instead, it was ravaged by the Inauspicious Evil.
 Because he had fused with the Strange Deity, Han Jue could see the Inauspicious Evil. The entire Chiliocosm World was filled with Inauspicious Evil. There were countless of them, like the scene of the Heavenly Devils in the past. However, all living beings couldn’t see the Inauspicious Evil and died for no reason, causing their fear and despair to far exceed the living beings of the previous Immortal World.
 Li Muyi fought a mysterious existence above the Chiliocosm World.
 Dark Sage King!
 This Dark Sage King wasn’t inferior to the Dao Heavenly Devil!
 However, he wasn’t much stronger.
 Han Jue had no intention of supporting Li Muyi and let them fight.
 Then, he began to observe the world the thousand disciples were in. It was considered peaceful. There were no Heavenly Devils or Inauspicious Evil. It formed a world of its own and developed steadily.
 Some Immortal Emperors were lost. This was normal. How could there be no danger?
 Han Jue watched for a while before turning around and preparing to leave.
 At this moment, the Black Hell Chicken suddenly flew over.
 It chuckled. “Master, I haven’t looked for you for a long time. Can you…”
 The Black Hell Chicken immediately became excited.
 The man and chicken returned to the Daoist temple.
 The Black Hell Chicken wanted Han Jue to teach it the Sword Dao Mystical Power. Han Jue didn’t reject it and was even a little glad.
 Han Jue was the closest to the Black Hell Chicken compared to his son, Dao Companions, and disciples.
 The Black Hell Chicken had always accompanied him. Although it had a sharp tongue, it could always help the new disciples blend in. It could quickly reduce the estrangement and unfamiliarity between the disciples.
 However, although the Black Hell Chicken usually cultivated, it did not have a strong thought of becoming stronger.
 Han Jue taught his strongest Sword Dao Mystical Power to the Black Hell Chicken.
 Ten Thousand Life Sword!
 Great Dao Mystical Power!
 Five years later.
 The Black Hell Chicken left the Daoist temple with a conflicted expression. When it passed Zhang Jue, it chuckled. “Old fellow, I’m about to rise. Do you have time to practice alone?”
 Zhang Jue ignored him.
 Bored, the Black Hell Chicken looked at the crimson fox not far away. It smiled and said, “Little fox, do you dare to spar with me?”
 The crimson fox said angrily, “How can a chicken defeat a fox?”
 The Black Hell Chicken almost died of anger. “Come!”
 The crimson fox said, “You want to disturb Master’s cultivation?”
 The Black Hell Chicken could only leave indignantly.
 Inside the Daoist temple.
 Han Jue sighed. This stinky chicken’s comprehension was not good. Should he let it reroll its life?
 He stopped thinking and opened the emails.
 (Your good friend Qiu Xilai has comprehended the Heavenly Dao. His Sage Heart has been repaired.]
 (Your good friend Han Ming was attacked by a Deity Realm existence. His body was destroyed and only a remnant soul was left.]

 red
 [Your good friend Huang Zuntian has received guidance from a Sage. His providence has increased greatly.]
 Li Daokong was still fighting Shi Dudao. As expected of him.
 Han Jue could sense that Li Daokong was growing rapidly and was not severely injured.
 As for the other emails, Han Jue didn’t care.
 In short, peace returned to the Immortal World.
 [Qiu Xilai wants to visit you in your dreams. Do you accept?]
 A notification appeared in front of him. This time, Qiu Xilai’s attitude changed and he didn’t dare to spam anymore.
 Han Jue thought for a moment and accepted the dream.
 It had already happened several times. There was no need to deduce first. Even if the Heavenly Dao wanted to target him, it was impossible.
 Han Jue had the Heavenly Dao Merit, the Heavenly Dao power couldn’t harm him.
 This was why so many experts pursued merit and preached the Dao to the heavens.
 In the dream.
 Seeing Qiu Xilai, he was no longer as tall as Han Jue.
 Qiu Xilai smiled and said, “Immeasurable Merit Divine Might Heavenly Sage, are you satisfied with this name?”
 Han Jue said, “It’s alright. What’s the matter?”
 This fellow’s attitude had changed too quickly!
 Wasn’t he very arrogant in the past?
 “Now, only 1, the South Extreme Heavenly Venerate, Sect Master Tian Jue, Fuxitian, Emperor Xiao, and you are left. Sage Jin’an and Sage Fated Secrets have already gone mad and are suppressed in their respective Dao Fields. The matter of the Heavenly Devils has made us wary. We are prepared to build the Chaotic City and guard the Chaotic Domain of the 33rd Heaven. This is a great merit. We will send our disciples to join. What about you?” Qiu Xilai asked with a smile.
 Han Jue asked, “Must I make arrangements?”
 Qiu Xilai hurriedly waved his hand. “Of course not. You’re our savior. If you’re unwilling, that’s fine. However, this is a great merit given by the Heavenly Dao. Although the Heavenly Devils are eliminated, there might be greater calamities in the future. Now, the Inauspicious Evil of the Dark Forbidden Zone is a potential calamity.
 “You can rest assured. We Sages have already communicated. We won’t scheme against you in the future. If you want, we can even acknowledge you as the Great Sage of the Heavenly Dao, such as the past Li Muyi. We can even support the Hidden Sect as the winner of the next Immeasurable Calamity, allowing the Hidden Sect to truly gain a foothold, like the various providence sects in the past.”
 These words were very sincere and made Han Jue feel comfortable.
 But he wouldn’t be fooled!
 He wouldn’t tie himself to the Heavenly Dao Sages.
 “I’ll consider it.”
 With that, Han Jue left the dream.
 Inside the Daoist temple.
 Han Jue was about to continue cultivating when someone sent a dream again.
 (Dijun sent you a dream. Do you accept?]
 [Dijun sent you a dream. Do you accept?]
 Dijun began to spam!
 Han Jue cursed silently. Qiu Xilai finally calmed down. Why was someone else causing trouble now?
 Dijun was an existence on the same level as Ancestor Xitian. He couldn’t provoke him.
Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates Tens of thousands of years ago, he had also sent a dream to him, but he was ignored.
 He guessed that Dijun already knew that he had eliminated the Heavenly Devil Calamity. If he ignored it, it would be very easy to offend him.
 Thus, he had to deduce first!
