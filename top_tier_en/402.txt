 This was especially the case for Dao Sovereign. He used to think that he was quite cold, but now, why was he chasing after him like a cowhide?
 Crazy!
 Han Jue prepared to leave.
 Dao Sovereign suddenly asked, “If you defeat me, I’ll join you!”
 Han Jue glanced at him and said, “If you can find me, you win.”.
 With that, he left with the Strange Deity. After returning to reality, Han Jue let the Strange Deity stay aside and continued cultivating  Next was to break through to the Six Mystic Divine Origin Realm!
 After that was the Zenith Heaven Realm!
 Twenty years later.
 Han Jue finally had a chance to break through.
 He adjusted his emotions and checked his emails to understand the recent commotion.
 [Your good friend Zhou Fan has grasped the True Sun Flame and has transformed into a Heavenly Dao Divine Spirit.]
 (Your good friend Ji Xianshen was attacked by demons] x14009
 (Your good friend Huang Zuntian was attacked by your good friend Di Lantian and was severely injured.]
 (Your Dao Companion Xuan Qingjun obtained a Supreme Treasure by chance. Her providence has increased greatly.]
 (Your good friend Li Daokong was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure and was severely injured.]
 [Your good friend Heavenly Emperor was attacked by your good friend Li Daokong and was severely injured.]
 (Your good friend Divine General was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure and died.]
 Heavenly Dao Divine Spirit?
 So impressive!
 As expected of a Sage.
 Han Jue had a feeling that Zhou Fan would become a dark horse in this Immeasurable Calamity.
 This was the first time Li Daokong was severely injured. He was even attacked by the Heavenly Emperor and a mysterious mighty figure.
 The Divine General had actually perished!
 Han Jue seriously suspected that the mysterious mighty figure who had severely injured Li Daokong was the same person who had killed the Divine General. Looking at the email about the Divine General’s death, Han Jue sighed. The Divine General was the Heavenly General who had worked the hardest for the Heavenly Court. He was always at the front.
 Han Jue asked in his heart, “Who is the mysterious mighty figure who killed the Divine General and severely injured Li Daokong?”
 (3 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 Han Jue felt that this might threaten him. He had to calculate.
 (Jade Emperor Zhou Yan]
 A name appeared in front of him. Below was the introduction of Jade Emperor Zhou Yan. It was the same as what he had seen before.
 It was indeed this fellow!
 Han Jue asked, “Does Jade Emperor Zhou Yan have any intention of harming the Heavenly Emperor?”
 (A billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [Yes]
 Han Jue frowned.
 No!
 He had to eliminate this fellow!
 Li Daokong was severely injured. Jade Emperor Zhou Yan’s next target might be Fang Liang. Furthermore, this fellow wanted to slaughter all living beings and create his own Heavenly Dao World.
 He couldn’t let him succeed!
 He had to break through first!
 Han Jue immediately started to break through.
 About four years later, he successfully broke through. Six Mystic Divine Origin!
 Han Jue’s Dharmic powers transformed and he reached perfection.
 As he consolidated his cultivation, he checked his attributes panel.
 [Name: Han Jue]
 [Race: Primordial Fiendcelestial]
 (Cultivation: Six Mystic Divine Origin]
 [Technique: Primordial Chaos Reincarnation Great Dao, Heavenly Cycle Body Tempering]
 (Great Dao: Great Dao of Life and Death, Great Dao of Karma]
 999 quadrillion years!
 Who else can match me!
T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by nov(ê(l)biin.co/m Han Jue felt proud.
 Next was to break through to the Zenith Heaven Realm!
 Five years later.
 Han Jue’s cultivation had completely consolidated. He wasn’t in a hurry to increase his Mystical Power. Instead, he visited the Heavenly Emperor in his dreams.
 After entering the dream, Han Jue saw the Heavenly Emperor and discovered that his hair was messy and his dragon robe was tattered as if he was a prisoner.
 Han Jue asked, “What’s wrong with you?”
 Seeing the Dark Forbidden Lord appear, the Heavenly Emperor’s eyes lit up.
 He said, “You guessed that he had the intention to rebel against the Dao Ancestor?”
 Han Jue said, “That’s right. Otherwise, why didn’t he help you subdue the chaos of the Heavenly Dao?”
 The Heavenly Emperor sighed. Clearly, the reason why he was in such a sorry state was because of Jade Emperor Zhou Yan.
 At this moment…
 A figure appeared beside the Heavenly Emperor. His figure was gray and like Han Jue, and his true appearance couldn’t be seen.
 Jade Emperor Zhou Yan!
 Han Jue instantly guessed the other party’s identity and was secretly shocked. How could this fellow enter his Dark Nightmare?
 Could it be that Jade Emperor Zhou Yan had already controlled the Heavenly Emperor?
 “Are you the Dark Forbidden Lord?” Jade Emperor Zhou Yan asked with a calm tone.
 Han Jue didn’t reply.
 Jade Emperor Zhou Yan ignored the Heavenly Emperor and stared at him. “Join forces with me. In the future, I’ll be the Dao Ancestor and you will be the Heavenly Emperor.”
 Han Jue felt that he was too arrogant.
 Did he really think that the Dao Ancestor was already gone?
 Somehow, the Dao Ancestor might have developed 2 stars of hatred towards Jade Emperor Zhou Yan.
 Han Jue pretended to sneer. “On what basis?”
 Jade Emperor Zhou Yan said, “If you refuse, you will be my enemy. Actually, I also want to fight with someone. No one in this world has the right to resist me!”
 Too arrogant!
 How could Han Jue tolerate him?
 He asked, “How are you going to deal with the Heavenly Emperor?”
 “Do you care about him?” “No, I care about Li Daokong. You injured him. I won’t let this go.”
 “Li Daokong is not dead, but he will die in my hands sooner or later. As for the Heavenly Emperor, I still have a use for him.”
 The two of them seemed to be old friends as they chatted casually.
 The Heavenly Emperor stood at the side and did not say a word.
 Soon, Han Jue and Jade Emperor Zhou Yan fell silent.
 The two of them stared at each other.
 Han Jue suddenly left the Dark Nightmare.
 (Jade Emperor Zhou Yan has developed hatred towards you. Current Hatred Points: 3 stars]
 Great!
 Han Jue directly took out the Book of Misfortune. Since the other party had already seen the Dark Forbidden Lord, Han Jue didn’t wait anymore. He suddenly thought of something and asked cautiously, “Has Jade Emperor Zhou Yan seen through my true identity?”
 (No]
 This time, his lifespan was not deducted. Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief and started cursing Jade Emperor Zhou Yan.
 He would spend 30 billion years playing with this fellow!
 Han Jue was no longer the same as before. Using 30 billion years of his lifespan at once should not be the limit.
 Five days later.
 Han Jue’s lifespan started to decrease. He opened his attributes panel and stared at it carefully.
 His lifespan had decreased much faster than before because the strength of his curse had also increased.
 Facing Jade Emperor Zhou Yan, he had to give it his all.
 Five billion years!
 Ten billion years!
 Twenty billion years!
 Thirty billion years!
 Forty billion years!
 Han Jue had no choice but to stop. His face was covered in blood and his soul was dizzy. He couldn’t take it anymore.
 He checked his emails and did not see any emails about Jade Emperor Zhou Yan being cursed.
 He was secretly depressed.
 This fellow was really stubborn!
 In the dark universe, above the sea of clouds, there was a crooked tree. Under the tree, a person was meditating.
 It was Jade Emperor Zhou Yan.
 He slowly opened his eyes and frowned. He muttered, “I underestimated you. No wonder those Zenith Heavens were forced to death by you.”
 He began to circulate his energy to heal his injuries.
 Facing the terrifying curse of the Dark Forbidden Lord, he almost lost his balance. Fortunately, his Mystical Powers were impressive and his Dharmic powers were boundless.
 Jade Emperor Zhou Yan became even warier of the Dark Forbidden Lord. Was the curse the Dark Forbidden Lord’s full strength?
 Apart from Sages, this was the first time he encountered an existence that he couldn’t deduce.
