 Jiang Dugu’s eyes lit up.
 At his cultivation level, he no longer pursued power or worldly possessions. He only pursued the position of Sage!
 Han Jue had a strange expression.
 It sounded like Li Muyi.
 Han Jue had transformed into a Sage several times before and remembered the voices of some Sages.
 Li Muyi was indeed a scammer. The Sage position was clearly in Nüwa’s hands, but he even deceived his own people.
 Jiang Dugu took a deep breath and said, “Alright! I understand!”
 The light dissipated.
 The illusion shattered, and Han Jue’s consciousness returned to reality.
 Among the people from the Hidden Sect, only Dao Sovereign was injured. Han Jue pinched his fingers to deduce and knew that not a single Nether Race member had died.
 He began to hesitate.
 Should he take revenge on Jiang Dugu?
 No!
 He had to take revenge!
 Although we are good friends, you can’t hurt my disciples!
 Han Jue took out the Book of Misfortune and started cursing Jiang Dugu.
 After cursing him for five days, Han Jue started cursing Li Muyi.
 It was all because of this old fox.
 Han Jue didn’t curse too hard. He warned everyone for five days.
 All sorts of people attended the Heavenly Race’s banquet. Han Jue wasn’t afraid of being exposed.
 After about 36 years, Murong Qi and the others finally returned. Dao Sovereign’s injuries had also recovered.
 The three of them met Han Jue.
 Murong Qi was the first to describe the regions that the Hidden Sect had obtained. There were a total of three regions, and the Hundred Peak Immortal River was in one. The region in the Immortal World was much larger than the Reroll World.
 The Hidden Sect didn’t obtain the most territory. It was inferior to the Three Schools of the Dao Sect, the Buddhist Sect, and the Heavenly Court, but it was not small either.
 Han Jue said, “That’s right, but this division is useless. In the end, it’s still survival of the fittest. Everyone will fight for supremacy.”
 Murong Qi nodded. “That’s true, but at least we have our own territory. By the way, someone attacked us during this banquet. Fortunately, the mighty figure behind the Heavenly Race took action.”
 Dao Sovereign cursed. “Damn it, he ran away quickly!”
 Jiang Yi teased. “You insisted on going up to show off, but in the end, you made him show off his power. How embarrassing.”
 Dao Sovereign glared at him angrily. Han Jue asked, “Li Daokong didn’t go?”
 Murong Qi shook his head and said, “No. I heard that Li Daokong has disappeared for some time. The Human School seems to be preparing to choose a new first and second disciple.”
 Han Jue raised his eyebrows.
 Speaking of which, he was very curious about the Human School.
 At first, he thought that there were only two disciples in the Human School. Later, he learned that there was a disciple like Jiang Dugu.
 Could it be that just like the Hidden Sect, only a few people were considered orthodox disciples?
 “You can leave. Cultivate well,” Han Jue said with his eyes closed.
 The three of them immediately bowed and left.
 As for the three regions, Han Jue didn’t want to care about them for the time being.
 Before attaining the Dao, he wouldn’t leave the Dao Field.
 After Murong Qi and the others returned, the other disciples gathered and asked about the banquet.
 The Heavenly Race Banquet was equivalent to the peak gathering of the current Immortal World. In the future, it would also be a miniature version of the Immortal World and even the myriad worlds.
 …
 In a hall outside the 33rd Heaven.
 Li Muyi, Sect Master Tian Jue, South Extreme Heavenly Venerate, and Sage Jin’an gathered and sat opposite each other. “Really?” Sect Master Tian Jue frowned and asked.
 Li Muyi said calmly, “That’s right. Although it didn’t hurt me, it was indeed a curse. I can’t tell who it is.”
 The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate snorted. “It seems that South Extreme Heavenly Venerate is right. There’s someone suspicious among the Sages!”
 The calamity had finally ended, but someone was already targeting other Sages. Their intentions were punishable!
 The Great Dao Calamity hung above the Sages like a sharp blade.
 What was the Dark Forbidden Lord trying to do?
 Get rid of all the Sages and dominate the Heavenly Dao, just like the Dao Ancestor of the past?
 Why could the Dao Ancestor keep becoming stronger? Wasn’t it because no one was competing with him!
 Ever since the Dao Ancestor became a Sage, no one could chase after him.
 After a long period of time, a second Heavenly Dao Sage appeared. Furthermore, in the following period of time, five Sages appeared one after another, causing the six Sages to compete and be unable to cultivate in peace.
 The Sages had always felt that there was a conspiracy
 Sage Jin’an asked, “If we can’t even deduce the Dark Forbidden Lord, wouldn’t he be stronger than us? Who is the strongest Sage of the current era?”
 The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate narrowed his eyes. “Sage Fated Secrets.”
 Sect Master Tian Jue said, “We can’t give up on suspecting him. After all, the first person the Dark Forbidden Lord cursed was him. Under normal circumstances, he would definitely start from the weakest.”
 Li Muyi said, “Although I’m not a Heavenly Dao Sage, my cultivation level is actually about the same as Sage Fated Secrets. I only created another Heavenly Dao. Recently, the Chiliocosm World has been in chaos. A mysterious existence is mobilizing the Inauspicious Evil of the Dark Forbidden Zone.”
 The other three Sages fell silent.
 It was as if a huge hand was manipulating everything. Even Sages were confused.
 Sage Jin’an suddenly said, “Could the disappearance of the Dao Ancestor be a trap? How can an existence like him be devoured by the Heavenly Dao?”
 Sect Master Tian Jue glanced at him and said, “Be careful with your words.”
 Li Muyi said, “Let’s find the Dark Forbidden Lord first. I feel that he’s fighting for the position left behind by Empress Nüwa. It’s very likely that he has already grasped the Primordial Purple Qi.”
 The Sages’ expressions turned ugly.
 Spring passed and autumn came. The Hundred Peak Immortal River became more and more lively.
 Ever since the Heavenly Race Banquet ended, more and more Connate lifeforms appeared, as if a new era was about to arrive.
 The Hundred Peak Immortal River was a mini version of that.
 In the next thousand years, there were more than a hundred new Connate lifeforms in the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 After a thousand years, Han Jue’s cultivation improved greatly again.
 He was getting closer and closer to the mid-stage of the Pseudo-Sage Realm.
 Han Jue was arrogant now.
 He felt that he could attain the Dao in ten thousand years.
F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com Perhaps before the next calamity, he would surpass the Heavenly Dao Sage level.
 At that time, if the Sages plot against him, he would directly appear and scare them into jumping up from their seats.
 At that time, Han Jue would say indifferently, “Sit down!”
 He felt great when he thought of this scene.
 A boring cultivation life required imagination and a firm goal.
 He might not do that when Han Jue really cultivated to that point.
 However, one thing was certain. Whoever dared to scheme against him would die as long as he was stronger than them.
 Although Han Jue was cautious, he was decisive and never showed mercy to his enemies!
 On this day.
 After Han Zuitian, the second Connate lifeform had transformed.
 Han Zuitian brought him around all day, visiting this and that as if he was showing off.
 The Black Hell Chicken disliked him and often found trouble with him.
 This was only the reflection of the bottom level of the Hidden Sect.
 Several months later.
 Dao Sovereign found Han Jue.
 “Master, I want to become a Zenith Heaven cultivator!” Dao Sovereign smiled confidently.
 As the first existence among the Hidden Sect disciples to reach the Zenith Heaven Realm, he had the right to be confident.
 Han Jue smiled in satisfaction. This day had finally come.
 “If you want to, you can do it.”
 “Why do I feel like something is missing?
 “Oh? The Chaotic Physique is not enough?”
 “Cough cough, the physique is a cultivation aspect. The Zenith Heaven Realm requires comprehension of the soul.”
