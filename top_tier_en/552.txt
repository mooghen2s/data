 Heavenly Venerate Wufa?
 Han Jue immediately checked his emails. As expected, he saw an email.
 [The providence of your enemy, Sage Jin’an, was severed by the Sages and he died.]
 Sage Jin’an’s portrait had already disappeared.
 How ruthless.
 Han Jue thought silently, “I want to know information about Heavenly Venerate Wufa.”

 (Heavenly Venerate Wufa: Perfected Heavenly Dao Sage, Immeasurable Emperor, disciple of the Dao Ancestor]
 Perfected Heavenly Dao Sage!
 This was quite something.
 (Heavenly Venerate Wufa has developed hatred towards you. Current Hatred Points: 3 stars]
 Han Jue showed a frown.
 Hatred towards him the moment he arrived?
 He had ill intentions!
 Han Jue hesitated to curse Heavenly Venerate Wufa. On the other side, a vast palace appeared outside the 33rd Heaven. It was extremely majestic, and the seven-colored light rose to a million feet tall. From afar, the palace looked like an ancient dragon.
 Qiu Xilai, Fuxitian, South Extreme Heavenly Venerate, Sect Master Tian Jue, Emperor Xiao, and Empress Houtu appeared. They looked at the new palace with complicated expressions.
 A plaque stood above the palace gate. Words were carved on it.
 Wufa Palace!
 “From today onwards, I will lead you to strengthen the Heavenly Dao. There will be no Heavenly Devil Tribulation. What you have to do is listen to my arrangements.”
 Heavenly Venerate Wufa’s voice floated out, his tone irrefutable.
 The Sages’ expressions turned ugly.
 Too arrogant!
 This was the first time he had come here. The Wufa Palace didn’t even open the door. It was rude.
 The Sages could only retreat and come to Qiu Xilai’s Dao Field.
 “Heavenly Venerate Wufa is a disciple of the Dao Ancestor. His cultivation is unfathomable. We’re probably not his match. Furthermore, he has the backing of a Great Dao Sage,” South Extreme Heavenly Venerate said with an ugly expression.
 Emperor Xiao frowned. “Don’t the three schools of the Dao Sect also have Great Dao Sages?”
 Sect Master Tian Jue sighed. “To be honest, we’ve already lost contact. Otherwise, we wouldn’t have relied on Ancestor Xitian.”
 Emperor Xiao and Empress Houtu frowned even more.
 Qiu Xilai took a deep breath and said, “An external force has begun to infiltrate the Heavenly Dao. We have to join forces. Not long ago, a Great Dao Sage also threatened me. As for who it is, I can’t say for the time being, lest I attract trouble.”
 The Sages’ expressions changed.
 Emperor Xiao said, “There’s a need to tell Han Jue about this. It’s already impossible to rely on us. We have to rely on his strength.”
 The other Sages nodded in agreement.
 After experiencing the Heavenly Devil Calamity, they all acknowledged Han Jue.
 No matter how the Heavenly Dao fought, they had to be united against the outside world.
 Forty years later.
 Emperor Xiao came to visit him.
 Han Jue moved him into the Daoist temple. Not only did he give Emperor Xiao face, but he also didn’t give Emperor Xiao a chance to observe the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 Emperor Xiao directly stated his intention. He explained the matter of Heavenly Venerate Wufa.
 Han Jue said, “I understand. I’ll consider this matter. Before that, the Sages can wait and see. Even if the Heavenly Dao changes owners, it won’t change in a short period of time. We have to understand our opponents first before making plans. As for me, I’m definitely more inclined towards you.”
 He must be joking.
 Heavenly Venerate Wufa had developed hatred towards him as soon as he arrived. He was already an enemy!
 Han Jue would definitely think of a way to kill him, but he couldn’t do it openly.
 Emperor Xiao smiled. “That’s enough. I’ll tell the other Sages.”
 The two of them exchanged a few more pleasantries before Han Jue sent him out.
 After Emperor Xiao left, Han Jue began to think about how to deal with Heavenly Venerate Wufa.
 Knowing one’s enemy was the key to victory.
 “I want to know if Heavenly Venerate Wufa can kill me?” Han Jue asked in his mind.
 (Ten billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 (There’s a certain possibility.]
 It was possible!
 Han Jue stood up and activated all the Supreme Treasures in his body. He directly jumped to the 33rd Heaven and quickly sensed the Heavenly Venerate Wufa’s palace.
 He jumped in front of the palace and immediately copied the cultivation of Heavenly Venerate Wufa before jumping away.
 Almost instantly!
 Han Jue felt a terrifying killing intent lock onto him.
 “Where are you escaping to?”
 Heavenly Venerate Wufa’s voice sounded. Time seemed to have stopped. Han Jue felt a terrifying palm strike land on his body, but it was canceled out by his Supreme Treasure.
 Han Jue jumped back into the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 Heavenly Venerate Wufa revealed himself and frowned.
 He wore a black Daoist robe and had a burly figure. His hair was very short, and his face was imprinted with golden Dao patterns that were difficult to understand. He emitted an ancient aura.
 He looked at his right palm and muttered, “What a powerful Dharma treasure. How can he have it? Could it be that he has other backgrounds?”
 On the other side.
 In the Daoist temple, Han Jue sat on the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus.
 [Heavenly Venerate Wufa’s hatred towards you has increased. Current Hatred Points: 4.5 stars]
 Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief. He didn’t feel anything after being slapped by Heavenly Venerate Wufa.
 The strongest treasure in his body could withstand a blow from a Freedom Sage. Heavenly Venerate Wufa was only a Heavenly Dao Sage. How could he hurt him?
 Han Jue began the simulation trial and challenged Heavenly Venerate Wufa.
 An hour later.
 Han Jue opened his eyes.
 He frowned slightly.
 In the first battle, he mainly probed Heavenly Venerable Wufa’s ability.
 Heavenly Venerate Wufa was actually stronger than Li Muyi. Although he was also a Heavenly Dao Sage, the Mystical Power he grasped already had the concept of a Great Dao Mystical Power.
 Han Jue won, but not happily.
 He continued to challenge.
 Ten minutes later, Han Jue successfully killed Heavenly Venerate Wufa.
 Not enough!
 Once the battle dragged on, the enemy would easily escape.
 Han Jue started the simulation trial again and again.
 After more than a hundred times, the battle time decreased to a minute.
 A thousand times later.
 Han Jue finally found a way to insta-kill Heavenly Venerate Wufa. He couldn’t help but sigh.
Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com He opened his eyes and smiled confidently.
 That’s it?
 Han Jue began to look down on Heavenly Venerate Wufa. Of course, he could only look down on him behind his back. If they really fought, he would definitely show weakness first and seize the opportunity when Heavenly Venerate Wufa relaxed.
 How could a battle of life and death be so fair?
 Han Jue only believed in dead enemies.
 He looked up at the 13th Heaven. Li Daokong and a thousand Nether Zeniths were temporarily staying in the Heavenly Race.
 All these years, Han Jue would look up while cultivating. Ji Xianshen had used the power of the Hidden Sect to begin purging the Heavenly Race. Many immortals were expelled.
 “I am Heavenly Venerate Wufa. I cannot preach the Dao in the 33rd Heaven. All living beings in the Heavenly Dao only need to call me by my name. They can come to the Wufa Palace to listen to the Dao and become disciples of the Wufa Sect.”
 Heavenly Venerate Wufa’s voice suddenly sounded.
 Han Jue raised his eyebrows. This fellow was something
 In the past, when Sages preached the Dao, they needed the listeners to head to the 33rd Heaven themselves. This process was enough to screen out living beings with insufficient cultivation levels.
 Heavenly Venerate Wufa was different. As long as they uttered his Sage name, they would be moved into the Wufa Palace. Unknowingly, he would obtain the favor of all living beings.
 In just a few breaths of time, Han Jue saw thousands of living beings being moved to the 33rd Heaven.
 After a period of time, the disciples of the Wufa Sect reached an extremely terrifying level.
 Not believing it, Han Jue thought to himself, “You have the guts to move all the living beings in the Immortal World to your Dao Field?!”
