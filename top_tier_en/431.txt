 (Li Muyi’s hatred towards you has increased. Current Hatred Points: 2 stars]
 What a willful Sage.
 Han Jue cursed silently, but he didn’t take it to heart.
 Two stars of Hatred Points was still at the level of having a bad impression and being annoyed. It had yet to reach the level of killing intent.
 Han Jue made up his mind that he couldn’t easily establish a relationship with a Sage. It was too dangerous.
 He had to attain the Dao first.
 Time passed.
 Year after year passed.
 After the first space-time vortex appeared, the Fusang Tree’s cultivation speed became faster and faster. The Connate Qi it produced also increased, benefiting the entire Dao Field.
 In the short term, the Fusang Tree would not be able to grow a second spatial vortex, but according to the system’s introduction, it would connect to the myriad worlds sooner or later.
 At that time, Han Jue could use the Fusang Tree as a hub and cross the myriad worlds. He could even create a Holy Land that stood above the myriad worlds, like the Sage Dao Field outside the 33rd Heaven.
 This was a very distant plan. Before attaining the Dao, it was impossible for Han Jue to create a Holy Land. It would attract countless troubles.
 Apart from the Fusang Tree, another ball of Fiendcelestial Qi had already appeared in Han Jue’s body. It was the same as the previous two balls and was still being nurtured. It was unknown how many years it would take for it to become a Chaotic Fiendcelestial.
 This was definitely a long wait. Perhaps the next Immeasurable Calamity would arrive by then.
 Han Jue entered his cultivation schedule again and absorbed the negative karma of the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus every day.
 A hundred years passed like a dream.
 Dao Comprehension Sword stepped into the Emperor Realm not long ago after obtaining Han Jue’s inheritance.
 It couldn’t be helped. Below the Emperor Realm were the Black Hell Chicken, Xun Chang’an, and the others. It was normal that they couldn’t defeat Dao Comprehension Sword. Han Jue had basically opened a back door for her.
 After stepping into the Emperor Realm, Dao Comprehension Sword was in high spirits. Chu Shiren was stimulated and began to cultivate with all his might to break through to the Emperor Realm.
 In the past hundred years, the war between humans and the Heavenly Court had become even more intense. Upon reading the emails, there were heavy injuries and attacks everywhere.
 It was unknown how much longer these two forces would fight. Fang Liang’s cultivation had been increasing steadily and had already reached the Rank Five Immortal Emperor Realm.
 He was definitely cheating. Perhaps this was the benefit of the battle for providence.
 No wonder so many living beings were crazy. On this day.
 Han Jue suppressed the Strange Deity in the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus and took out the Book of Misfortune to curse Great Nine Heavens.
 A hundred years had passed. Great Nine Heavens should have already left the Sage’s side, right?
 Calculate!
 (2 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 If he had left, Han Jue would have to invest 500 billion years of his lifespan. Two billion was nothing!
 (The Sage is still beside him.)
 Bastard!
𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com Did he want to stay there forever? Han Jue cursed Great Nine Heavens for being shameless.
 In the Endless Palace.
 Great Nine Heavens, who was meditating, frowned and gritted his teeth.
 “The Dark Forbidden Lord is really persistent! Isn’t he tired? Where did he go to capture so many living beings? Could he be rearing them?”
 Great Nine Heavens cursed in his heart. He was extremely regretful.
 If he had known earlier, he definitely wouldn’t have provoked the Dark Forbidden Lord.
 Which Sage was it?
 Didn’t he find this degrading?
 Great Nine Heavens was filled with hatred.
 The Sage, South Extreme Heavenly Venerate, asked, “Is the Dark Forbidden Lord cursing you again?”
 Great Nine Heavens sighed. “That’s right. I don’t know what to do, either.”
 The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate said faintly, “Among the Sages, only the one from the Western Buddhist Sect is so petty.”
 Great Nine Heavens widened his eyes and asked in surprise, “But I’m not targeting the Buddhist Sect. Although Jade Emperor Zhou Yan has also challenged the Buddhist Sect, he fought with them first.”
 The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate said calmly, “Perhaps he had no choice but to agree because of someone’s plea. A long time ago, the Sages had a bet. The Chan School won, so they obtained a chance for Jade Emperor Zhou Yan to win great providence. For some reason, the Sages from all over seemed to have changed their minds. Fuxitian even personally entered. How strange.”
 Great Nine Heavens did not reply. He didn’t dare to express his opinion regarding the matters between Sages.
 The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate waved his right hand, and a beam of light appeared in front of him, condensing into an old figure. “Dao Ancestor, how difficult has this calamity become?” the South Extreme Heavenly Venerate asked.
 Great Nine Heavens hurriedly kowtowed to the ground, not daring to look at the Dao Ancestor.
 The Dao Ancestor replied, “If a Sage enters the calamity, the Heavenly Dao will be in danger.”
 The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate frowned.
 He immediately waved his hand, causing the Dao Ancestor’s illusion to vanish.
 Great Nine Heavens looked up and asked carefully, “Isn’t Dao Ancestor…”
 The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate replied, “This is the Dao Ancestor’s Dharma Idol. It can guide the Sages, but we can only ask about the general trend and cannot sever the fate of the Sages and all living beings.” Great Nine Heavens was enlightened.
 The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate said, “From today onwards, you will stay in the Dao Field. I will arrange for others to enter the calamity.”
 Great Nine Heavens felt relieved and hurriedly thanked him.
 He indeed did not dare to enter the calamity again. The Dark Forbidden Lord was still staring at him.
 “I have to find the one from the Western Buddhist Sect.” The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate stood up.
 Great Nine Heavens asked nervously, “When will you return?”
 The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate glanced at him and said, “When meeting a Sage, you must bow to me. The Dark Forbidden Lord won’t dare to enter the Dao Field. As for the curse, the Dao Field will also help you isolate it. Don’t worry, I’ll be back soon.”
 Great Nine Heavens could only nod.
 Inside the Connate Cave Abode.
 Five days had passed since the curse. Han Jue’s lifespan began to decrease. He looked worried.
 If this Great Nine Heavens continued to hide in South Extreme Heavenly Venerate’s Dao Field, wouldn’t he be unable to kill the other party?
 No.
 The hatred was already very high, and this fellow would harm the Heavenly Emperor.
 He had to kill him.
 “Should I calculate? What if he just happened to leave?”
 Han Jue thought.
 Even if it was once!
 No, he could only put it aside for the time being
 Therefore, Han Jue spent another two billion years of his lifespan.
 [The Sage is not beside him.]
 Han Jue suddenly widened his eyes.
 His chance was here!
 I’ll kill you now!
 Han Jue immediately cursed with all his might, causing his lifespan to decrease rapidly.
 Far away, Great Nine Heavens’ expression changed drastically.
 Oh no!
 This fellow was definitely a Sage!
 The moment the South Extreme Heavenly Venerate left, he started cursing him?
 If this was not a Sage, what was?
 Great Nine Heavens hurriedly circulated his energy to resist the curse.
 Violent winds stirred in the Dao Field. Countless waves surged into Great Nine Heavens and transformed into a mysterious power that helped him resist the curse.
 However, the curse was stronger than ever.
 The Dark Forbidden Lord wanted to kill him!
 Crap! Great Nine Heavens shouted, “Master! Save me!”
 Although the South Extreme Heavenly Venerate had left, as long as he called, he believed that he could hear it.
 “I’m trapped by Sages. I can’t help you for the time being. Try your best to live.”
 The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate’s voice was filled with anger.
 Great Nine Heavens’ face instantly turned pale. No wonder the South Extreme Heavenly Venerate had not returned for several days. It was all a trap!
 The Sages had deliberately lured the South Extreme Heavenly Venerate out to kill Great Nine Heavens?
 Why!
 This didn’t make sense!
