 “Come in.” Hearing Han Jue’s voice, Long Hao looked happy. He immediately stood up and walked into the Daoist temple.
 He knelt in front of Han Jue and bowed respectfully.
 Currently, he was already at the Six Mystic Divine Origin and was very close to the Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm. His talent was outstanding, but after experiencing the Immeasurable Calamity, his providence had been suppressed.
 Hao Tian flew out of Long Hao’s body and said, “This kid’s cultivation level is stuck at the Six Mystic Divine Origin. I suspect that someone has done something to him. Help take a look.”
 Long Hao looked up, his eyes filled with hope.
 Han Jue probed Long Hao’s soul with his Sage Sense.
 Eh?
 Really!
 This power was hidden very deeply and imprisoned Long Hao’s Dao Fruit.
 Wait!
 Isn’t this the Heavenly Emperor’s Dharmic powers?
 Han Jue’s expression did not change, but he was surprised.
 Thinking about it carefully, it was difficult to judge the Heavenly Emperor’s attitude towards Long Hao. He said that he doted on Long Hao, but he didn’t pass the Heavenly Emperor position to him. He said that he hated Long Hao, but he entrusted this son to Han Jue as well.
 The Heavenly Emperor had so many sons. After the calamity ended, only Long Hao survived.
 No matter what the Heavenly Emperor thought, since Long Hao came to find Han Jue, he had no choice but to attack.
 Perhaps this force was to protect Long Hao from being possessed by Hao Tian, but it was impossible to possess him under Han Jue’s eyes.
 With a thought, the Heavenly Emperor’s Dharmic powers that imprisoned Long Hao’s Dao Fruit dissipated.
 In an instant, Long Hao felt relieved.
 He looked at him in surprise and asked, “Master, you...”
 Han Jue replied, “Yes, go back and cultivate well.”
 Long Hao hurriedly kowtowed and left.
 Hao Tian also bowed.
 After leaving the Daoist temple, Hao Tian sighed. “Your master is really powerful. I feel that he has already surpassed those high and mighty Sages.”
 Long Hao smiled proudly. “Nonsense. My master ended the Heavenly Devil Calamity. Even the Sages are convinced!”
 Hao Tian shook his head and laughed. He felt that Long Hao was the luckiest in his life to have acknowledged Han Jue as his master. Otherwise, he would have long been possessed by him and would have died in the calamity.
 On the other side.
 Han Jue was about to continue cultivating when the Heavenly Emperor sent him a dream. He should be called the Evil Heavenly Emperor now.
 Han Jue accepted the Evil Heavenly Emperor’s dream. This time, the dream was not the forest outside the Jade Pure Sacred Sect, but a barren land covered in corpses.
 The sky was very high and covered in dark clouds. It was extremely oppressive.
 Han Jue saw the Evil Heavenly Emperor standing on a small mountain made of bones.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor looked down at him and said, “Why did you get rid of Long Hao’s Dharmic powers seal?”
 Han Jue said, “I don’t know what Your Majesty wants. I thought you wanted to protect him. Now that he’s safe, I’ll remove it and let his cultivation no longer have an obstacle.”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor stared at him coldly.
 [Evil Heavenly Emperor’s favorability towards you has decreased. Current favorability: 3 stars]
 Han Jue sighed in his mind. He asked, “You don’t like Long Hao? Why did you ask me to take him in as my disciple, then?”
 Evil Heavenly Emperor said, “It’s not that I don’t like Long Hao, it’s just that I don’t like Hao Tian. The stronger Long Hao is now, the stronger Hao Tian is. The two of them are the same.”
 Han Jue was silent. As expected.
 Evil Heavenly Emperor asked, “Look around. What do you feel?”
 Han Jue said, “The Heavenly Dao is really
 good.”
 “Yes, compared to the Heavenly Dao, this place is even more terrifying than the netherworld. This is the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End.”
 “Fortunately, I didn’t go to the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End.”
 “No, you should come. You can only become stronger here. If you stay in the Heavenly Dao, you will stop at the Sage Realm and won’t be able to advance anymore. I’ve witnessed the battle of Freedom Sages previously. Their words can become reality. They can change the battle that has already happened with a word. Don’t you want that power?” “I want it, but I haven’t reached the peak of a Sage yet. I don’t have to take the risk for the time being.”
 “True.”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor was speechless.
 Han Jue was nervous.
 Their words could become reality?
 They could even change the past?
 Was this time travel, or was it directly determined through fate?
 The Deity Realm of the Ruins of End was really dangerous!
 Han Jue saw that the Evil Heavenly Emperor was silent and couldn’t help but ask with concern, “How’s His Majesty recently?”
 “It’s alright. I hope that you won’t be too close to Hao Tian. If possible, I hope that you can destroy him.” The Evil Heavenly Emperor shook his head.
 Han Jue said, “I’ll consider it. If Your Majesty is in trouble, if I can help you, feel free to ask.”
 “Mm.”
 The dream ended.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and frowned.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor’s state was getting stranger and stranger. Even though he was not yet a Sage, it still made Han Jue uneasy. It seemed that the inferior Strange Deity and the Inauspicious Evil had a huge effect on him.
 As for destroying Hao Tian, Han Jue wouldn’t do anything for the time being.
 He had no reputation. Besides, Hao Tian’s favorability towards him was high.
 Han Jue could only wait for Hao Tian to make a mistake before helping the Heavenly Emperor kill this fellow.
 No matter what, he was closer to the Heavenly Emperor. If Hao Tian had always been loyal, there was no choice.
 If he killed him for no reason, what would the other disciples think?
 Han Jue stopped thinking and focused on cultivating
 Spring passed and autumn came. The stars spun endlessly.
 Another three thousand years passed.
 Han Jue had OCD and deliberately went out of seclusion after hitting a round number.
 He opened his eyes and began to check his emails. There were attacks, opportunities, mysterious curses, and other fortuitous encounters.
 An email attracted Han Jue’s attention.
 [Your good friend Emperor Xiao left the Heavenly Dao.]
 [Your good friend Emperor Xiao received guidance from a mysterious mighty figure and began to leave the Heavenly Dao’s providence.]
 Han Jue checked Emperor Xiao’s portrait and discovered that his cultivation didn’t decrease.
 In other words, he was not weakened but wanted to become stronger.
 Could it be that he wanted to imitate Li Muyi and jump out of the Heavenly Dao Sage’s identity?
 No.
 The mysterious mighty figure should be an even stronger existence.
 Han Jue frowned and felt that he needed to calculate to prevent himself from being plotted against.
 “I want to know who’s guiding Emperor Xiao.”
 (70 billion years of lifespan will be consumed. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 A figure appeared in Han Jue’s mind, and a line of words appeared in front of him.
 [Luo Hou: Perfected Freedom Sage, Ancestor of the Devil Race, Immeasurable Emperor, Son of the Heavenly Dao, Dao Ancestor’s Fiend Body]
 Han Jue’s expression became strange.
 He had heard of Luo Hou. His name was spread throughout the world, but the providence label behind this was very problematic.
 The Devil Ancestor Luo Hou was actually the Son of the Heavenly Dao, and it was even the Dao Ancestor’s Fiend Body!
 Everyone knew that the reason why the Dao Ancestor stood out was to trample on the Devil Ancestor’s position. That was also the Heavenly Dao’s first calamity, the battle of the Dao and Devils.
 Could all of this be the Dao Ancestor’s self-directed show?
 Or had the Dao Ancestor subdued Luo Hou?
 Han Jue wanted to continue calculating the relationship between Luo Hou and the Dao Ancestor.
 [It involves an existence that surpasses the system’s limits. It cannot be deduced.]
 Han Jue had no choice but to look at Luo Hou again.
 He felt that the other party was about to make a comeback.
 These Heavenly Dao Sages all had powerful backgrounds. Fortunately, Han Jue didn’t kill them directly.

 Even if something happened, they would fight it out. There was no need for him to charge in.
 Han Jue stood up and decided to go out and preach the Dao to eliminate any distracting thoughts.
 At the same time.
 In the extreme north of the Immortal World, dense cracks suddenly appeared on the endless ice land. It quickly expanded, and wisps of terrifying black aura rose from below.
