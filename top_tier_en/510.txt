 Netherworld, by the Yellow Spring.
 Empress Houtu stood by the river while Yang Tiandong knelt behind her.
 Here again.
 Han Jue was speechless. Why did Empress Houtu always choose to tell people matters at the Yellow Spring? Plotting out loud?
 Listen to them!
 Yang Tiandong was the first to ask, “Empress, why are you looking for me?”
 Empress Houtu said, “Recently, the Hidden Sect has been in trouble. Go and express your goodwill to them on the netherworld’s behalf. You don’t have to be afraid of the other factions’ guesses.”
 Yang Tiandong was pleasantly surprised when he heard this. “Thank you, Empress!”
 Although he had been reincarnated several times, he had always remembered that he was the eldest disciple of the Hidden Sect.
 “It’s very meaningful to go to the Hidden Sect this time. Don’t be rude. Your master seems to be wary of me, but it’s normal. The fact that the Underworld showed sincerity when the Sages targeted the Hidden Sect already means everything. You can tell your master that resisting the Sage Sect alone is not a good thing,” Empress Houtu said softly.
 She raised her right hand, and a small tree that seemed to be covered in golden treasures appeared in her palm. It was golden and extremely dazzling.
 Yang Tiandong asked curiously, “What is this?”
 “This is a Connate Sage Artifact. It can produce Connate Qi. It’s a greeting gift.”
 “Thank you, Empress.”
 Yang Tiandong looked happy. In that case, he would be able to face Han Jue better.
 The illusion was destroyed.
 Han Jue’s consciousness returned to reality and his eyebrows relaxed.
 Perhaps he had been overthinking.
 Han Jue moved Yang Tiandong directly into the Dao Field, and he landed in front of the Daoist temple.
 Yang Tiandong felt his vision blur. His surroundings suddenly changed. Looking at the Fusang Tree not far away, he couldn’t help but be stunned.
 “It’s already so tall…” Yang Tiandong muttered to himself. The memories of the past surged like spring water and appeared in front of him, making him sigh.
 His gaze landed on the door of the Daoist temple. He knelt on the ground and said, “I, your unfilial disciple, greet Master. I hope that you will still acknowledge me as your disciple.”
 Han Jue didn’t answer.
 At this moment, Li Daokong, Dao Sovereign, Xun Chang’an, Murong Qi, and the other Hidden Sect disciples appeared around him.
 They looked at Yang Tiandong with different expressions.
 Yang Tiandong was greatly different from before. Although his face was similar to his previous life, his temperament and figure were very similar to the King of Hell. He had a long beard at his temples and wore a runic robe. His entire body emitted a ghostly aura.
 were
 “You’ve become the King of Hell?” Chu Shiren asked in surprise.
 King of Hell!
 The disciples looked at each other.
 Li Daokong narrowed his eyes and said, “It’s not only the King of Hell. His body contains powerful strength that’s similar to the Magus Race.”
 The others followed suit and observed Yang Tiandong
 He was very uncomfortable and shocked.
 Looking around, he felt that everyone was stronger than him. There were many people he did not know.
 He was an Immortal Emperor!
 Did I find the wrong place?
 This thought was dispelled when Yang Tiandong saw Xun Chang’an and the Black Hell Chicken.
 It could only be said that after thirty thousand years, the Hidden Sect had already changed.
 At this moment, Han Jue’s voice floated out.
 “For this trip, are you returning to the Hidden Sect or were you asked by someone to come here?”
 Hearing this, Yang Tiandong was moved. He was very excited and even had the urge to cry when he heard Han Jue’s voice again.
 Reincarnation was full of ups and downs. There were all sorts of things in the world. The one that haunted his dreams the most was Han Jue, the Hidden Sect, and the Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain.
 Yang Tiandong immediately said, “Of course, I’m returning to the Hidden Sect!”
 However, he regretted it as soon as he said that.
 In fact, he was indeed asked to return and had to go back to the netherworld later.
 Yang Tiandong hesitated. “Master, can I talk to you in private?”
Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m The Black Hell Chicken shouted, “Private? You’ve already betrayed Master and want to assassinate him now?”
 The others looked at Yang Tiandong with hostility.
 Even the old disciples who knew Yang Tiandong felt that something was wrong with him.
 It was mainly because the change was too
 great.
 Han Jue moved Yang Tiandong into the Daoist temple and said, “Hurry up and cultivate!”
 The disciples immediately dispersed.
 Several days later.
 Yang Tiandong appeared outside the Hundred Peak Immortal River. He floated in the air in a daze.
 Recalling the conversation over the past few days, for some reason, he felt like he was dreaming
 From the beginning to the end, he didn’t see Han Jue’s true appearance.
 Empress Houtu had told him everything. Han Jue had also accepted the Sacred Artifact. Everything was very smooth.
 However, when Yang Tiandong looked back, the Hundred Peak Immortal River seemed so mysterious and distant, as if it could never be reached.
 Yang Tiandong was filled with regret.
 Perhaps…
 He shouldn’t have chosen to become the King of Hell…
 However, he could only continue on this path.
 Yang Tiandong sighed and decided to take care of the Hidden Sect disciples in the future in exchange for Han Jue’s trust.
 On the other side.
 Han Jue planted the Sage Artifact under the Fusang Tree. The Golden Origin Fruit produced by this item could help increase one’s lifespan. It was a good treasure.
 After instructing the Black Hell Chicken, Chaotic Heavenly Dog, Ah Da, and Xiao Er to watch over it, he returned to the Daoist temple.
 Han Jue didn’t distrust Yang Tiandong. On the contrary, he supported him to be the King of Hell. In the future, he would be equivalent to an informant in the netherworld.
 After the illusion, Han Jue’s impression of Empress Houtu improved again.
 Perhaps Empress Houtu had designs on the Nether Race, but it was simply human nature. Thinking about it carefully, she didn’t let him down.
 Sometimes, seeing through people was not good. It was easy to think too much.
 Han Jue stopped thinking and continued cultivating.
 Two hundred years later.
 The sky above the Hundred Peak Immortal River welcomed a phenomenon. Golden rain scattered down on the mortal world. Immortal birds flew in rows high in the sky. Immortal Qi surged, covering the sky like multicolored light.
 This phenomenon caused the Hidden Sect disciples to discuss.
 “What happened again?”
 “I guess the Sages want to lure us out.”
 “It’s meaningless. Continue cultivating.”
 “Didn’t the Sages say that they wanted to destroy our Hidden Sect?”
 “Hahaha, who can enter the Hundred Peak Immortal River?”
 Looking at the phenomenon in the sky, all the disciples were chatting, including the in-name disciples.
 Ever since Sect Master Tian Jue announced that he wanted to eradicate the Hidden Sect, the fact that they had survived until now was a complete slap to the Sage’s face.
 Such a situation caused the Hidden Sect’s cohesion to increase. Even the in-name disciples felt that Han Jue was stronger than Sages.
 Han Jue noticed the phenomenon and couldn’t help but deduce with his fingers.
 He was a Pseudo-Sage and had a certain level of karma perception. However, he wasn’t involved and could not be understood by the system.
 However, this time, Han Jue understood on his own.
 Above the 13th Heaven, a group of fairies held a bamboo basket and scattered golden water. The golden water transformed into torrential rain that poured down on the mortal world.
 Han Jue wondered what these fairies wanted to do.
 He narrowed his eyes and looked up.
 At this moment!
 Han Jue suddenly saw that these fairies were actually demons and ghosts in human skin. They were all sinister and terrifying with all kinds of postures. What is this?
