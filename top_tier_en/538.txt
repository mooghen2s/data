 There was only one way.
 They felt desolate. So what if they survived this calamity?
 In the future, wouldn’t they have to bow down to Qiu Xilai?
 Emperor Xiao said, “Let’s transcend this tribulation first. Qiu Xilai will personally face the Dao Heavenly Devil. He’s under greater pressure than us. We have to support him now.”
 His words were approved by the other Sages.
 This matter was settled.
 Year after year passed.
 Another hundred years passed.
 In the past hundred years, many things had happened. Mighty figures had established the mortal world, and some new races wanted to fight for providence.
 The Golden Crows on the sun appeared and began to create demons.
 The demons that had once filled the heavens appeared again!
 The concept of demons was very vague. Other than the Heavenly Dao Race, everyone could be considered a demon. With this slogan, the Golden Crows’ power quickly expanded.
 The legend of the Hundred Peak Immortal River faded again and was no longer mentioned by everyone.
 The thousand Immortal Emperors from the Hidden Sect also took root in that new world. This world had yet to be unified and was in a chaotic period.
 Han Jue didn’t pay attention to these thousand in-name disciples. If they really encountered trouble, he could just use the Invocation Dao to teleport all of them back.
 At this current stage, Han Jue focused on comprehending the Great Dao of Extreme Origin. His Sage power kept increasing, and he was frantically chasing after the mid-stage Primordial Chaos Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm.
 Only by reaching the mid-stage Primordial Chaos Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm would Han Jue’s strength increase greatly and allow him to insta-kill Qiu Xilai and Dao Heavenly Devil.
 Cultivating in the Sage Realm required time.
 On this day.
 Another battle erupted in the 33rd Heaven. Han Jue could sense it. He looked up, and Qiu Xilai appeared in front of the black hole. Three Supreme Treasures of different forms floated around him, emitting three-colored divine light.
 The other Sages watched from afar.
 Qiu Xilai suddenly rushed into the black hole.
 In an instant, purple lightning flashed like dragons and snakes interweaving. Soon, it shrank and disappeared.
 The Sages were stunned.
 South Extreme Heavenly Venerate frowned. “What’s going on? I can’t sense their aura at
 all.”
 Sect Master Tian Jue said expressionlessly, “We can only wait and see.”
 On the other side.
 Han Jue couldn’t help but check his emails.
 (Your good friend Qiu Xilai has fused with the Heavenly Dao providence and stepped into the Heavenly Dao Realm.]
 (Your good friend Qiu Xilai was attacked by a mysterious Heavenly Devil.]
 Next, Qiu Xilai was constantly attacked by Heavenly Devils. It seemed that there was more than one Heavenly Devil in the black hole.
 Han Jue flashed the emails in front of him. As he cultivated, he paid attention to Qiu Xilai’s situation.
 In the next three hundred years, Qiu Xilai was attacked by a mysterious Heavenly Devil more than a million times.
 The Dao Heavenly Devil was still very strong. Even if he fused with the providence of the Heavenly Dao, Qiu Xilai still couldn’t defeat him.
 From the looks of it, Qiu Xilai was not very strong
 Although Han Jue couldn’t insta-kill the Dao Heavenly Devil, he could still kill him in five minutes.
 What he panicked about was that the enemy could not be insta-killed. It was not invincible against Han Jue.
 On this day.
 (Your good friend Qiu Xilai was attacked by a mysterious Heavenly Devil and was severely injured.]
 Qiu Xilai still lost!
 Han Jue shook his head.
 It seemed that Qiu Xilai was about the same strength as Dao Heavenly Devil, but the latter had greater persistence.
 The Heavenly Dao Sage was still a Heavenly Dao Sage. Useless!
 Han Jue secretly felt disdain.
 At the same time.
 The sky suddenly turned red. The entire Immortal World was the same. An extremely oppressive atmosphere filled the world.
 Immediately after, black holes of different sizes appeared in the sky. It was as if the sky was filled with holes, looking sinister and terrifying
 This scene shocked all the living beings in the world.
 The world was in an uproar!
 Malevolent Heavenly Devils flew out from the dense black holes. These Heavenly Devils had different forms. Their bodies were wrapped in a black aura and their bodies were different in size. The common point was that their appearance was terrifying and ugly with blood-red eyes. The biggest Heavenly Devil was a million feet tall. The smallest Heavenly Devil was also taller than a mortal.
 Han Jue instantly felt several Heavenly Devils that were comparable to a Pseudo-Sage.
 Qiu Xilai had really lost!
 [Detected that the Heavenly Devils are coming and that the Heavenly Dao Calamity is coming. You have the following choices:]
 (1: Exit seclusion immediately and kill all the Heavenly Devils. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment, a Supreme Treasure, and a chance to activate a new function of the system.]
 [2: Cultivate in a low-profile manner and do not fight with the Heavenly Devils. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment and a Mystical Power inheritance.]
 When Han Jue saw these three lines of words, he didn’t make a decision immediately.
 If it was in the past, he would definitely choose the second option.
 However, a new function of the system attracted him.
 It wasn’t difficult to kill all the Heavenly Devils. It was simple to kill them.
 Han Jue decided to choose after some time.
 There was no need to choose immediately unless he was in a hurry to receive the reward.
 He continued to cultivate.
 The chaos in the Immortal World would be resolved by the Immortal World. He had to hurry up and become stronger so that he could insta-kill the Dao Heavenly Devil.
 In this year, the Immortal World was in chaos and fell into slaughter.
 The addition of the Heavenly Devils made all living beings unite against the outside world.
 However, this calamity couldn’t end in a short period of time.
 The Heavenly Devils’ vitality was extremely strong. Even if he was torn into pieces, he could still recover his body. He had to be reduced to ashes and his body and soul destroyed before he could truly die.
 In the same realm, the Heavenly Dao lifeforms weren’t the Heavenly Devil’s lifeforms’ match at all. Fortunately, the Heavenly Dao lifeforms had the advantage in numbers. This battle entered a stalemate decades later.
 Spring passed and autumn came. It had been two hundred years since the Heavenly Devils attacked.
 Many Heavenly Devils also appeared around the Hundred Peak Immortal River, but they couldn’t break through the Dao Field’s array formation and quickly left.
 The disciples would also discuss this while cultivating.
T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by nov(ê(l)biin.co/m However, without Han Jue’s instructions, they wouldn’t act rashly.
 Han Jue was still cultivating and didn’t panic.
 After all, he had already experienced the restart of the Heavenly Dao. What could scare him now?
 Through the emails, he saw that Qiu Xilai was still fighting the Dao Heavenly Devil. He couldn’t help but pity him. He guessed that Qiu Xilai was being beaten up and could not escape. How tragic.
 Han Jue continued to check his emails.

     Intense!
 How exciting!
 Han Jue almost fainted.
 What attracted him the most was that Empress Houtu was severely injured.
 Although Empress Houtu wasn’t a Sage, she was not something that ordinary Pseudo-Sages could compare to.
 The Heavenly Devils had already invaded the netherworld. He wondered how the other worlds were doing.
 [Qiu Xilai wants to visit you in your dreams. Do you accept?]
 (Qiu Xilai wants to visit you in your dreams. Do you accept?]
 This notification started to flood the screen, interrupting Han Jue from reading his emails.
 He frowned and asked cautiously, “If I accept his dream now, will my life be in danger?”
