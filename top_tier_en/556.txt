 He began to check Heavenly Venerate Wufa’s attributes.
 (Heavenly Venerate Wufa: Early-stage of the Freedom Primordial Chaos Realm, Immeasurable Emperor, disciple of the Dao Ancestor. Because he was enslaved by you using the Primordial Heavenly Prison, his favorability towards you has reached the maximum.]
 Early-stage of the Freedom Primordial Chaos Realm!
 Freedom Sage?
 Han Jue had a strange expression.
 Heavenly Venerate Wufa was meditating and not moving
 Han Jue asked in his mind, “His cultivation level far exceeds mine. Will he betray me?”
 [No, unless he surpasses the system’s limits.]
 The Dao Field could already block the prying of the Great Dao above. Its limit naturally far exceeded the Freedom Sages.
 Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief and was suddenly amused.
 In that case, he had benefited.
 In order to master the Heavenly Dao, Heavenly Venerate Wufa had no choice but to become a Heavenly Dao Sage. His cultivation level weakened, but it gave Han Jue a chance.
 Han Jue said, “Kneel down.”
 Hearing this, Heavenly Venerate Wufa suddenly opened his eyes and knelt down.
 Bastard!
 You tried to make me kneel before you earlier!
 Kneel for a period of time yourself!
 Han Jue asked, “Who sent you to the Heavenly Dao?”
 Heavenly Venerate Wufa replied, “Heavenly Sect Master.”
 “What is his goal?”
 “For me to grasp the Heavenly Dao. Then, he will absorb my providence and break free from the Great Dao array formation that the Dao Ancestor used to suppress him.”
 “Why was the Heavenly Sect Master suppressed by the Dao Ancestor?”
 “After the Heavenly Sect Master became a Great Dao Sage, he started the battle of the Sages and angered the Dao Ancestor.”
 Han Jue couldn’t help but think of the Investiture of the Gods. In the Divine Investiture War, the Heavenly Sect Master had also triggered the battle of the Sages. If this legend was true, the Heavenly Sect Master would really not give up.
 However, he felt that the Divine Investiture War might not be true. It should be a Heavenly Dao projection. It happened to project a mythical history into the minds of mortals. It blurred the process and resulted in a similar legend.
 No matter what, the Heavenly Sect Master couldn’t escape for the time being. He couldn’t find trouble with him.
 Han Jue continued, “Tell me about the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End in detail.”
 Heavenly Venerate Wufa replied, “The Deity Realm of the Ruins of End is boundless. It’s filled with Great Dao restrictions. Even Sages can’t interact with it instantly. Living beings below the Emperor Realm can’t survive there. The Deity Realm of the Ruins of End is desolate, and existences called Dao Devils wander around. The strongest Dao Devil can even devour ordinary Sages, so the races in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End are very cautious.
 “The Buddhist Sect, the Dao Sect, the Devil Race, the Demon Race, the Dragon Race, and so on are all scattered in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End. They don’t disturb each other. Not only that. Because the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End is located in the Dark Forbidden Zone, the Inauspicious Evil can freely infiltrate it and attack living beings.
 “Currently, the strongest one in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End is the Seven Dao Sage. He created the Great Dao Pagoda. He doesn’t have many disciples, but they are all elites.”
 Han Jue listened carefully. He felt glad.
 From the sound of it, the Heavenly Dao was the safest!
 Be it the Inauspicious Evil or the Dao Devils, they couldn’t infiltrate the Heavenly Dao.
 If he didn’t have the system, if he wanted to advance, after reaching the Sage Realm, he indeed would have to go to the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End. From what Heavenly Venerate Wufa said, Han Jue learned that other than the terrifying Dao Devils, the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End was filled with all sorts of Great Dao forms.
 Great Dao had even transformed into spirits and walked the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End to preach the Great Dao. In terms of opportunities, the Heavenly Dao couldn’t compare.
 Han Jue suspected that the Great Dao Divine Spirit was formed by the Great Dao.
 After Heavenly Venerate Wufa finished speaking, Han Jue asked curiously, “Dao Devils can even kill Sages. How can ordinary living beings survive?”
 Even the Heavenly Emperor could take root in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End!
 Heavenly Venerate Wufa replied, “The origins of the Dao Devils are mysterious. They don’t have independent thoughts and only find living beings of the same realm to hunt. Speaking of which, the Dao Devils are very similar to the Heavenly Devils. It’s just that the Heavenly Devils have intelligence and the Dao Devils are stronger.”
 I see.
 Han Jue narrowed his eyes. “In other words, the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End has not formed a civilization, much less unified. Is it like the Wilderness?”
 Heavenly Venerate Wufa nodded and sighed. “In the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End, other than relying on mighty figures, one can only constantly fight and pursue the Great Dao. That place is like the chaos before the creation of the world. There’s no peace when the three thousand Chaotic Fiendcelestials fight.”
 Han Jue asked, “What about the Ancient Desolate? How much do you know about it?”
 Heavenly Venerate Wufa shook his head. “I have never entered the Ancient Desolate. Perhaps, I have, but I don’t remember. The Ancient Desolate is extremely mysterious. It’s the greatest forbidden land in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End.”
 Han Jue fell into deep thought.
 Heavenly Venerate Wufa said, “If you want to surpass the Primordial Chaos Dao Fruit, you still have to head to the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End to pursue the Great Dao that belongs to you. The Heavenly Dao can at most produce Connate Qi. After stepping into the Sage Realm, it’s very difficult to cultivate. It’s very difficult to comprehend the Great Dao in the Heavenly Dao because it’s very far away.”
 Han Jue nodded and continued to question him.
 Several days later.
 Heavenly Venerate Wufa left and returned to the 33rd Heaven to preside over the Wufa Palace.
 His return shocked the Sages. Could it be that Han Jue had lost?
 Han Jue began the simulation trial and fought the current Heavenly Venerate Wufa.
 Two hours passed.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and frowned.
 With his current strength, it was indeed difficult for him to fight against a Freedom Sage.
 He fought for two hours without winning.
 Fortunately, Heavenly Venerate Wufa was now his subordinate and could not threaten him.
 “I should comprehend the Great Dao of Extreme Origin,” Han Jue muttered to himself. Through his communication with Heavenly Venerate Wufa, Han Jue knew that he was still very weak.
 However, there was one good thing. No matter who came to the Heavenly Dao, they had to stay!
 Unless they were stronger than the Dao Ancestor!
 Han Jue suddenly thought of Ancestor Xitian. He was clearly stronger than the other Heavenly Dao Sages. Why was he not affected by the Heavenly Dao?
 Could it be because Ancestor Xitian did not attack?
 In any case, as long as he stayed in the Heavenly Dao, Han Jue was invincible.
 Steady!
 At this moment, Qiu Xilai sent him a dream.
 Han Jue accepted it. Just like he had guessed, Qiu Xilai asked about Heavenly Venerable Wufa.
 Han Jue said that he and Heavenly Venerate Wufa had reached an agreement. In the future, when they fought for providence, they would follow the rules and not act recklessly like before.
 He didn’t directly say that he couldn’t subdue the Heavenly Venerate. He could use this to restrain the other Sages.
 Qiu Xilai heaved a sigh of relief and informed the other Sages about this.
 The Heavenly Dao regained its calm.
 After the Wufa Sect was scattered, a large number of sects appeared in the Immortal World.
 Heavenly Venerate Wufa preached the Dao for a hundred years. Ten billion disciples had been subdued. Many living beings had ambitions and wanted to fight for themselves. There were hundreds of conflicts in the Immortal World. Battles between cultivators could be seen everywhere. It looked a little chaotic, but the overall providence of the Heavenly Dao was becoming stronger.
 On the other side.
 13th Heaven, South-Heaven Gate.
 Li Daokong and Han You stood side by side. A thousand Nether Zeniths waited at the horizon.
 Ji Xianshen asked, “Are you really not staying?”
Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com Li Daokong shook his head. “We should return to report. After so many years, the Heavenly Race is already under your control. You only need to be careful of the Heavenly God General. This person is extremely shrewd and has gone under many masters.”
 Ji Xianshen nodded.
 Li Daokong didn’t say anything else and left with Han You.
 Ji Xianshen looked at Li Daokong’s back, his eyes filled with envy.
 Li Daokong had become the person he wanted to become. He was powerful and unrestrained. He did as he pleased.
 Unknowingly, Ji Xianshen had become greedy for power. Even he did not know.
 At this moment, a golden light shot over from below. It pierced through the clouds and then through the South-Heaven Gate’s plaque. The golden light rose and entered the 14th Heaven.
