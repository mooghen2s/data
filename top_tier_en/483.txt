 A deafening terrifying collision suddenly sounded from the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 Han Jue, who was cultivating, immediately saw that Jiang Dugu wanted to barge into the Dao Field.
 He’s asking to get killed!
 Han Jue cursed silently. He checked Jiang Dugu’s cultivation.
 Mid-stage Pseudo-Sage Realm!
 How dare he try to barge into his Dao Field?
 Han Jue sighed. No matter how Jiang Dugu tried to break into the Dao Field, it was impossible.
 However, this commotion was too great!
 The Hidden Sect disciples spread their divine sense and caught sight of Jiang Dugu.
 “It’s him…”
 Zhou Fan’s expression changed slightly as he looked furious.
 Long Hao was the same.
 At this moment, the guard Sima Yi suddenly rushed out of the Dao Field.
 Boom! Boom! Boom…
 Explosions sounded outside the Dao Field. The mountains and rivers shook, and violent winds stirred the sea of clouds.
 Everyone from the Hidden Sect went to the edge of the Dao Field to watch.
 Sima Yi was a clone of Shi Dudao. Fighting Jiang Dugu was definitely a world-shattering battle.
 Jiang Dugu was completely suppressed!
 Sima Yi had his left hand behind his waist. His right hand condensed into a pagoda with his Dharmic powers. Driven by his fingers, the pagoda suppressed Jiang Dugu at an extremely fast speed. It was so fast that Jiang Dugu couldn’t even react.
 The pagoda wasn’t huge, but every time it landed, the ground would collapse. Space could be seen with the naked eye, like twisting black centipedes, looking sinister and terrifying
 “Shi Dudao! How is that possible!”
 Jiang Dugu’s eyes widened in disbelief.
 Sima Yi shook his arms. Terrifying Dharmic powers erupted like a wave, quickly covering the sky and bringing darkness to the world.
 Jiang Dugu’s expression changed drastically as he immediately fled.
 Sima Yi did not pursue. He stopped and returned to the Dao Field.
 Zhou Fan, Long Hao, and Hao Tian were dumbfounded.
 They knew that the Dao Field’s guard was very strong, but they didn’t expect him to be this strong. Jiang Dugu had yet to use his Supreme Treasure and was already frightened away.
 At least he let Jiang Dugu go. Han Jue wanted to intimidate the Providence Sect and not find trouble with him if there was nothing.
 As for being discovered by the Sages, Han Jue didn’t care.
𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com So what if they knew!
 Could they enter the Immortal World and beat him up?
 Han Jue smiled and continued cultivating.
 It had been more than two thousand years since his last breakthrough. With Han Jue’s cultivation speed, it was not difficult for him to break through again in five thousand years.
 Outside the 33rd Heaven.
 Jiang Dugu knelt in front of Li Muyi, whose body shone like a god that had opened the sky.
 “Really?” Li Muyi asked in a low voice.
 Jiang Dugu’s expression was ugly. “That’s right, it’s indeed Shi Dudao.”
 Li Muyi said, “Shi Dudao is cultivating in South Extreme Heavenly Venerate’s Dao Field. It can’t be him.”
 He pinched his fingers to deduce and discovered that he could not deduce that Dao Field.
 Something was wrong!
 Jiang Dugu said in a low voice, “Most importantly, that Dao Field. I tried my best but still couldn’t break through it. I feel like… I’m trying to charge into a Sage Dao Field!”
 “Impossible!” Li Muyi said firmly.
 Jiang Dugu was silent.
 Li Muyi also fell silent. Several breaths later, he said, “I’ll go personally take a look.”
 Jiang Dugu’s eyes lit up and he immediately nodded.
 Sages couldn’t enter the Immortal World personally, but it was not difficult to send a clone or Dharma Idol.
 Fifty years later.
 Han Jue was cultivating in the Daoist temple when he suddenly heard someone preaching. The Dao voice sounded like an illusion and came from afar.
 He opened his eyes and immediately checked the surrounding enemies.
 [Li Muyi: Perfected Pseudo-Sage Realm, one of the Three Corpses of a Sage]
 Oh!
 He was finally here!
 Han Jue had already expected to attract the attention of the Sages, so he was not flustered or surprised.
 He closed his eyes again and started the simulation trial with Li Muyi.
 He fought with all his might.
 Too close!
 Fortunately, he could kill the guy instantly!
 Even if it was a Sage’s clone, his cultivation was only at the Pseudo-Sage Realm. How could he defeat Han Jue?
 Completely relieved, Han Jue’s focus returned to cultivation.
 With the array formation around, even if the disciples were bewitched, they could not break out.
 The Hidden Sect disciples quickly heard Li Muyi’s lecture and rushed in that direction to the edge of the Dao Field.
 Li Muyi was preaching halfway up a mountain. He shook his head and wore ordinary clothes. He was like a farmer in the mountains, but at this period, there were no farmers.
 Connate lifeforms ran towards him from all directions. It was a spectacular sight.
 “Who is that fellow?” Jiang Yi asked unhappily.
 They were used to Han Jue’s lecture and didn’t like Li Muyi’s.
 Dao Sovereign’s eyes flickered. “Should we deal with him?”
 This was the Hidden Sect’s territory!
 Murong Qi said, “Don’t be anxious. Let’s wait and see. It might be a trap. Don’t forget Jiang Dugu. Our Hidden Sect might have been exposed!”
 The other disciples had solemn expressions.
 They scanned Li Muyi with their divine sense and were shocked to find that they could not see through him.
 This time, they did not dare to think about leaving
 Hao Tian’s figure appeared above Long Hao’s head. He said in a low voice, “A Sage’s avatar!”
 Everyone was shocked.
 Li Muyi seemed to have heard Hao Tian’s voice and couldn’t help but glance at him.
 Hao Tian was so frightened that he immediately shrank back into Long Hao’s body.
 “So what if he’s a Sage? He doesn’t even dare to enter!” the Black Hell Chicken said disdainfully.
 It believed that if there was really danger, Han Jue would definitely escape.
 What did it mean that he did not run away now?
 It meant safety!
 Hearing its words, the others’ eyes lit up.
 Li Yao said, “The senior guards didn’t come. It seems that Sect Master is confident. The reason why the other party is preaching the Dao is to trick us out.”
 Zhao Xuanyuan sighed. “Master is remarkable. The Dao Field can actually stop a Sage.”
 The others also sighed. As they spoke, Li Muyi’s mouth twitched.
 Pretending not to hear them, he continued speaking
 Soon, the disciples returned to cultivate.
 Year after year passed.
 More and more Connate lifeforms appeared outside the Hundred Peak Immortal River. At a glance, the entire mountain was filled with all sorts of birds and beasts.
 A hundred years later, the number of Connate lifeforms here had already exceeded a hundred thousand. They were still steadily increasing.
 From the looks of it, Li Muyi planned to set up a Dao Field here?
 Han Jue couldn’t help but send a voice transmission to him, “Senior, what do you mean by this?”
 Li Muyi replied with a smile, “Young friend, you’re really impressive. Why don’t you invite me into the Dao Field?”
 “I’m afraid of death.”
 “You should have already guessed my identity. I won’t attack you. In the past, I’ve sent you a dream, but you were in the Dark Forbidden Zone and didn’t receive it.”
 “Then, what’s the matter?”
 “Do you want the Sage position?”
 Wow!
 Were Sages only capable of promising this?
 Han Jue said, “Sage Qiu Xilai has already promised to give me a Sage position. Could it be that there are two Sage positions available?”
 Li Muyi was moved. “He doesn’t have a Sage position. Don’t be fooled.”
 “Really? Then, I have to ask him,” Han Jue replied doubtfully.
 “Hmph!”
 A cold snort sounded. It was Qiu Xilai.
 This old bald donkey was actually spying on them!
 Li Muyi seemed to have heard something. He slowly stood up and transformed into a beam of light that shot into the sky.
 Han Jue didn’t mind. He let Qiu Xilai and Li Muyi restrain each other so that they wouldn’t disturb him.
