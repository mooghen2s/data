 “Why should I serve you? Are you very strong?” Yi Tian shouted unhappily. He had always been the one taking in subordinates. He had never been anyone’s subordinate. Previously, in the demons and the Divine Palace, the leaders had been polite to him.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor said calmly, “I’m the previous Heavenly Emperor of the Heavenly Court. I’ve already attained the Dao. Tell me, am I strong?”
 The previous Heavenly Emperor?
 Han Tuo was shocked. The current Heavenly Emperor was Fang Liang, and Fang Liang was his father’s grand-disciple. Was the Evil Heavenly Emperor a friend or foe of his father, Han Jue?
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor seemed to see through his nervousness. “Back then, before your father became an immortal, he was highly regarded by me. Your father even worked for me. Don’t you want that?”
 Han Tuo asked carefully, “My father?”
 Yi Tian was surprised. Wasn’t Han Tuo’s father long gone?
 “That’s right. It’s Han Jue, the master of the Hidden Sect,” the Evil Heavenly Emperor said calmly.
 Han Tuo looked like Han Jue. The Evil Heavenly Emperor had just calculated the karma and actually couldn’t deduce it. This meant that Han Tuo had a powerful background and could only be related to Han Jue.
 Yi Tian widened his eyes and exclaimed, “Your father is the Sect Master of the Hidden Sect? Why didn’t you mention it before?”
 The master of the Hidden Sect was a legendary figure in the Immortal World. He was on par with Sages and had once saved the myriad worlds in the universe. He had endless merit.
 Han Tuo smiled bitterly. “I only learned of it not long ago.”
 He looked at the Evil Heavenly Emperor.
 He was still a little vigilant, but the other party directly told him about his relationship with Han Jue. He naturally couldn’t lie.
 “Can you tell me about the past you knew my father?” Han Tuo asked.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor smiled meaningfully and slowly sat down. “Of course. This has to start before the Heavenly Dao was restarted. At that time, the Heavenly Court controlled the myriad worlds in the universe. Your father was only a nobody in a mortal world...’
 Han Tuo meditated and began to listen carefully.
 Yi Tian was also very interested in Han Tuo’s father and began to listen quietly.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor fell into a daze and recounted the past.
 After a long while...
 After the Evil Heavenly Emperor finished speaking, Han Tuo and Yi Tian were still immersed in the past.
 Yi Tian jolted awake and suddenly asked, “According to you, the Sect Master of the Hidden Sect only used a few hundred thousand years to attain the Dao?”
 Han Tuo also realized this, and his expression turned strange.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor said, “That’s right. Han Jue is only 30,000 years older than Han Tuo. His talent is the greatest I’ve ever seen. No existence can compare to him.”
 Han Tuo’s expression changed drastically.
 30,000 years... If he was given thirty thousand years, he might not be able to break through to the perfected Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm. Han Jue, who was only thirty thousand years older than him, was already a top-notch existence among Sages. This difference...
 Han Tuo smiled bitterly, deeply affected. He originally thought that he would become Han Jue’s pride. Now, it seemed that he had embarrassed him.
 Yi Tian was also shocked. He had always thought that he was the most talented, but compared to Han Tuo’s father...
 “Oh, right, I’ve calculated. Han Jue’s Dao attainment timing was close to your birth date. In other words, it only took Han Jue more than thirty thousand years to go from a mortal to a Sage,” the Evil Heavenly Emperor teased.
 He was also shocked.
 This kid...
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor knew that Han Jue’s talent was extremely terrifying, but after thinking about it, it made his scalp tingle.
 Even if the Dao Ancestor was reborn, he still couldn’t compare!
 Han Tuo and Yi Tian fell into shock and couldn’t extricate themselves for a long time.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor did not disturb them. He had to calm down himself.
 Han Tuo looked up and clenched his fists. “You’ve nurtured my father. Then, I’ll serve you. Can you let me catch up to my father?”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor’s expression did not change as he felt a little awkward.
 He was ashamed to say this. He knew his limits. It was impossible for his care for Han Jue to help him attain the Dao. He himself had relied on the inheritance of the Dark Sage King to attain the Dao.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor said, “I can’t promise you directly. Your father’s talent is unheard of. However, if you serve me, you will definitely obtain a huge opportunity. The opportunity far exceeds your growth in the Immortal World. The Immortal World is still the chessboard of the Sages, but there are existences stronger than them in the Dark Forbidden Zone. Now that the Chaos is in chaos, it’s time to fight for the huge opportunity.
 “The two of you have the potential of Chaotic Fiendcelestials. I will confer you the title of Heavenly Generals. There will only be three Heavenly Generals in the Heavenly Court. Your status will only be second to mine!”
 Han Tuo and Yi Tian looked at each other and saw the anticipation in each other’s eyes.
 Instead of messing around, it was better to follow the Ancient Heavenly Emperor who had nurtured a Sage!
 Yi Tian asked, “What’s a Chaotic Fiendcelestial?”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor looked at him deeply. “You are!”
 Yi Tian was stunned.
 Han Tuo was very calm. Yi Tian’s potential was too ridiculous. Even if his father gave him a cheat, he almost couldn’t catch up.
 Only the legendary Chaotic Fiendcelestial could explain it!
 Wait.
 Then, what was his father?
 Was he also a Chaotic Fiendcelestial?
 The difference in potential between the Chaotic Fiendcelestials was also great?
 Han Tuo couldn’t figure it out, but after hearing the Evil Heavenly Emperor’s story, he suddenly didn’t dare to expect to surpass Han Jue. He only hoped to satisfy him.
 A thousand years passed.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and deduced Han Tuo.
 This fellow had left the Heavenly Dao for a period of time. His cultivation level had been increasing, but the Dark Forbidden Zone was still very dangerous.
 After calculating with his fingers, Han Jue’s expression became strange.
 Eh?
 He deduced that there was a familiar providence beside Han Tuo.
 Evil Heavenly Emperor...
 Providence was very mysterious. Not only was there providence in the Heavenly Dao, but there was also providence in the Chaos. It was the providence of the Great Dao.
 “This kid...”
 Han Jue suddenly discovered that Han Tuo’s path was very similar to his. Along the way, he encountered the care of Immortal Emperor Samsara and the Heavenly Emperor.
 However, the Evil Heavenly Emperor was ultimately on the wrong path. Han Jue was still a little worried.
 “I want to know what will happen if Han Tuo follows the Evil Heavenly Emperor?” Han Jue asked in his mind.

 Han Jue’s consciousness entered the illusion.
 He opened his eyes and discovered that he had arrived at a huge meteor. Countless figures were standing around him. Not only on the meteor, but countless figures were also floating in the surrounding space. They were all dressed in black armor and surrounded by a black aura. They were all looking in one direction.
 Evil Heavenly Emperor...
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor sat on a stone chair with a domineering attitude. In front of him stood three figures emitting a terrifying aura. Among them were Han Tuo and Yi Tian.
 Eh?
 Han Jue narrowed his eyes. He noticed that Han Tuo’s state was like that of a Freedom Sage. His Freedom aura was visible to the naked eye.
 Yi Tian said in a low voice, “Your Majesty, we are ready.”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor slowly stood up. The entire dark space distorted as a domineering aura erupted, sweeping through the Dark Forbidden Zone.
 “Immortal Gods of the Heavenly Court, I have established the Heavenly Court for several eras. The Heavenly Court has unified the Dark Forbidden Zone and swept through the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End. We have destroyed the Inauspicious Evil, expelled the Dao Devils, and protected hundreds of Little Heavenly Dao. You are my proudest soldiers. Now, an unprecedented enemy is about to arrive. We can’t retreat. If we do, the Heavenly Dao will definitely be destroyed!
 “Are you prepared to fight for the honor of Heavenly Court?”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor’s voice was filled with dominance, causing all the immortals of the Heavenly Court to reply in unison, “I am willing to sacrifice my body and soul for Your Majesty!”
