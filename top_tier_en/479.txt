 Hearing that he was going to preach the Dao, everyone flocked to a mountain.
 Between the two mountains was a vast grassland that had already become the place where the Hidden Sect preached the Dao.
 Everyone was looking forward to Han Jue’s lecture. Every time the lecture ended, they would gain something.
 This time, Han Jue decided to embark on the Great Dao of Extreme Origin.
 He wanted to pull the Nether Race to his side as soon as possible so that Empress Houtu would not keep thinking about them.
 When all the Nether Race members cultivated the Great Dao of Extreme Origin, they would have to follow Han Jue in the future!
 The Connate lifeforms of the Hundred Peak Immortal River also secretly listened. Han Jue turned a blind eye to this.
 He was really not afraid of others learning it.
 As long as one cultivated the Great Dao of Extreme Origin, they would have to take him as their master eventually.
 This was also the reason why the Sages often preached to all living beings.
 Because there were many Sages, they couldn’t directly preach to all living beings. They would only invite the mighty figures of the world to the 33rd Heaven from time to time.
 Time passed.
 Days passed.
 Fifty years passed in the blink of an eye.
 Han Jue returned to the Daoist temple, and the Strange Deity followed.
 Looking at the Strange Deity’s rare appearance, Han Jue sighed and smiled. “Time really passed quickly.”
 The Strange Deity came to his back and began to rub against him.
 Han Jue realized that he was really old. He would always sigh about the past and reminisce about the old days.
 He was indeed old. After all, he was more than ten thousand years old.
 Ten thousand years was enough for the world to change completely.
 Although he was emotional, he still had to cultivate.
 Han Jue began to condense the Fiendcelestial Qi in the world of stars and condensed a new Fiendcelestial Dharma idol.
 Not to mention nurturing three thousand fiendcelestials, he had yet to even reach 1% of the Three Thousand Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols.

 Only by having a close target could he pull himself towards a distant target.
 13th Heaven, Heavenly Race.
 In a golden palace, Ji Xianshen and Fang Liang stood facing each other.
 Ji Xianshen walked back and forth. He placed his hands behind his waist and frowned.
 Fang Liang said impatiently, “How much longer are you going to walk? You’re the Heavenly Ancestor now!”
 Ji Xianshen stopped and said unhappily, “How can I not be anxious? The Sages said that they want to choose a new Sage. If this Sage doesn’t come from the Heavenly Race, a large force that can compete with the Heavenly Race will definitely emerge in the future!”
 Upon mentioning this, Ji Xianshen stomped his feet.
 The Heavenly Race was a mixed breed. His trusted aides were not strong enough to fight for the position.
 Ji Xianshen hated himself for being born too late. If he had been born tens of thousands of years earlier, he might have been able to fight for the Sage position himself! Fang Liang said, “Actually, there’s no need to worry. The Sages didn’t say when the Sage position will be given out. The last calamity has just ended. Even if a Pseudo-Sage wants to become a Sage, it will take countless years.”
 Ji Xianshen’s expression softened. He felt that it made sense.
 He suddenly thought of something and asked, “Can’t your Grandmaster defeat Li Daokong? Why don’t we let him fight for the position?”
 Fang Liang said awkwardly, “That’s not good. He doesn’t want to be disturbed…”
 “Are you stupid? If he becomes a Sage, who will dare to disturb him in the future? His cultivation goal is to become a Sage in the end. If we give him this opportunity, he will only be happier,” Ji Xianshen said angrily. He felt that ever since Fang Liang had failed the calamity, his brain had not been good. He used to be a smart kid. It was all those high and mighty Sages’ fault.
 Fang Liang sighed. “Alright, I’ll ask.”
 Another twenty years passed since the lecture ended.
 On this day, Han Jue sensed the divine sense fluctuation from the Heavenly Dao Token. He took it out.
 “Hello?”
 “Grandmaster?”
 “Mm.”
 “I have an opportunity for you.”
 “Get lost!”
 “Huh?”
 “You also want to trick your Grandmaster?”
 “No, this opportunity is extraordinary. It’s about becoming a Sage!”
 “You have the Primordial Purple Qi?”
 “I don’t. Do you need Primordial Purple Qi to attain the Dao?”
 “Of course. Didn’t the Sage behind you mention this? Now, every Sage claims to have the Primordial Purple Qi. As for finding people to fight for the Sage position, this is all a conspiracy. Don’t believe it so easily.”
 “Understood.”
 After severing his divine sense, Fang Liang immediately went to find Ji Xianshen.
 Han Jue put away the Heavenly Dao Token and couldn’t help but sigh. “Sages are best at fooling people.”
 Did these Sages not even blink when lying?
 The Primordial Purple Qi was in Empress Nüwa’s hands. The Sages didn’t have the confidence and insisted on declaring that they had a Sage position.
 They were probably worried that the prodigies would be snatched away by other Sages. Han Jue didn’t think too much and continued cultivating
 On the other side.
 Fang Liang found Ji Xianshen and told him what Han Jue said.
 Ji Xianshen’s expression changed. He sent a voice transmission to Fang Liang, “It seems that the Sages don’t have good intentions and want us to fight among ourselves.”
 Fang Liang replied, “That’s right. If not for Grandmaster’s reminder, we would probably be led by the nose. However, this is also a good thing. If we don’t say it, the others will fight for the Sage position for nothing. We can secretly strengthen our forces.”
 “That makes sense. Help me thank your Grandmaster.”
 “It’s fine.”
 “But then again, doesn’t your Grandmaster mean that he has a Sage behind him or that a Sage is contacting him?”
 “Isn’t that normal?”
 “True.”
 Ji Xianshen fell into deep thought. It was unknown what he was thinking.
 …
 In the depths of the sea, in a palace hidden in the darkness.
 Long Hao was meditating and cultivating. A soul body surrounded him. It was Hao Tian.
 Hao Tian seemed to be thinking about something with a solemn expression.
 Long Hao opened his eyes and asked, “Have you thought of a way?”.
 Hao Tian said, “That’s so fast. I feel that the matter of the Sage position is too fishy. If the Sages have the Primordial Purple Qi, they will definitely hide it well. How can they directly publicize it?”
 Long Hao asked, “Is it a trap?”
 Hao Tian didn’t say anything else and continued wandering around.
 Long Hao sighed and said faintly, “If I knew earlier, I shouldn’t have left the Hidden Sect. If I didn’t leave the Hidden Sect, I would still be cultivating in seclusion without any worries. If I was still in seclusion, I might already be attempting to break through to the Zenith Heaven Realm. When I break through to the Zenith Heaven Realm and continue cultivating with Master, I might be able to use my strength to attain the Dao. I don’t need any Primordial Purple Qi…”
 He began to chatter, making Hao Tian annoyed.
 Ever since the calamity ended, Long Hao had always been talking nonsense. He knew that he would regret it. Hao Tian had no room for regret. He was just very helpless.
 He had missed too many opportunities in the past, causing him to be suppressed by many Sages and unable to make a comeback.
 Some Sages were even his juniors.
 The pain in his heart was greater than anyone else.
 “Why don’t we go back? I’ll introduce you to Master. As long as you show your loyalty, he’ll definitely take you in!” Long Hao suddenly said.
 Hao Tian frowned. “Join him?”
 Long Hao said, “Look at our Hidden Sect. Someone else has become the Heavenly Emperor. Have you forgotten about the Heavenly Race Banquet not long ago? The Hidden Sect already has 200 Immortal Emperors. What does this mean? My master is accumulating strength! According to what I found out, Dao Sovereign and Jiang Yi have both joined the Hidden Sect. You should know their potential.”
