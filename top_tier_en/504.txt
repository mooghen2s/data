 The white-robed man said impatiently, “This fellow? He can threaten the Hidden Sect?”
 If not for the fact that the three immortals were sincere, the white-robed man wouldn’t have bothered to come out.
 Eagle Head Immortal said shamelessly, “He’s the god of the Heavenly Race and wants to confer us the title of Earth God. He said that in the future, the Heavenly Race will expel the Hidden Sect and let us be Earth Gods.”
 The Earth God wanted to say something, but he couldn’t make a sound.
 The white-robed man frowned. “Wait for me.”
 He turned around and left.
 Soon.
 Han Zuitian and Li Xuan’ao arrived.
 Li Xuan’ao sized up the Earth God and said, “It’s indeed the god of the Heavenly Race.”
 He didn’t know the Earth God, but he was also from the Heavenly Race and could distinguish auras and providence.
 Han Zuitian looked at the three immortals and said, “I know you. You’re indeed sincere. Don’t worry, I will mention you to Grandmaster.”
 Hearing this, the three immortals were pleasantly surprised and quickly thanked him.
 Han Zuitian looked at Li Xuan’ao and asked, “What should we do with this Earth God?”
F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com Li Xuan’ao said calmly, “Kill him. The three of you, attack now.”
 The Earth God’s expression changed drastically.
 Without another word, Eagle Head Immortal slapped his palm on the top of the Earth God’s head, sucking his soul out. Snake Head Immortal swallowed the Earth God’s body.
 Eagle Head Immortal threw the Earth God’s soul to his third brother, the Heavenly Immortal.
 The Heavenly Immortal’s eyes emitted a strange light that extinguished the Earth God’s soul.
 Li Xuan’ao raised his eyebrows in surprise.
 Unexpectedly, the three immortals had their own abilities!
 The reason why he asked them to kill the Earth God now was to test them. Their decisiveness proved that they were indeed on the Hidden Sect’s side.
 Li Xuan’ao smiled in satisfaction. “You have great vision. Wait for a bit.” The three immortals quickly thanked him.
 Li Xuan’ao and Han Zuitian left.
 In the sky.
 Li Xuan’ao said, “These three are not bad. If you can take them in, take care of them in the future. They will become your right-hand men.”
 Han Zuitian nodded.
 That day, Li Xuan’ao went to visit Han Jue and talked about this.
 Han Jue thought for a moment and moved the three immortals into the Dao Field, letting Li Xuan’ao receive them.
 After Li Xuan’ao left, Han Jue’s expression became strange.
 Why did this fellow become a talent in internal affairs?
 He had always thought that Li Xuan’ao was a brute. He didn’t expect that after joining the Hidden Sect, he would be more passionate about all sorts of planning and decision making.
 Han Jue shook his head and laughed. In any case, Li Xuan’ao’s favorability towards him was six stars. He didn’t have to worry.
 Once his favorability decreased, even if only by half a star, Han Jue would still give him a warning
 There was no hour measuring in the Immortal World. Other than a few people, all living beings wouldn’t calculate time. The world was vast and filled with Spirit Qi. As long as one didn’t provoke the enemy, one could live for a long time. Under such circumstances, time became unimportant.
 Han Jue was one of the few people who liked to pay attention to time. After all, he had the system and had already developed the habit of looking at lifespan.
 As years passed, the situation in the Immortal World gradually changed.
 This was the first time the number of Connate lifeforms erupted. After their cultivation levels increased, they began to consider reproducing
 Now, in the Immortal World, there were the seven famous major factions: Jie School, Chan School, Human School, Buddhist Sect, Heavenly Race, Ancient Race, and Hidden Sect. Although Ancient Fiendish Yin had perished, the Ancient Race had indeed survived tenaciously and even became stronger. This was because they were the first force formed by Connate lifeforms. Most living beings acknowledged the Ancient Race as their race.
 Just like that, 1,200 years passed.
 That day, Han Jue was cultivating.
 [Detected that the Primordial Purple Qi has descended into the Immortal World. You have the following choices:]
 (1: Exit seclusion immediately and fight for the Primordial Purple Qi. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment and a Mystical Power inheritance.]
 [2: Continue cultivating and stay away from trouble. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment and a Supreme Treasure.]
 Primordial Purple Qi?
 Han Jue was stunned. Didn’t Nüwa say that she would keep it for him?
 Could it be another Primordial Purple Qi?
 Han Jue silently chose the second option.
 (You choose to continue cultivating and obtain a Great Dao Fragment and a Supreme Treasure.)
 [Congratulations on obtaining the Heavenly Dao Numinous Treasure-Heavenly Origin Bracelet]
 (Heavenly Origin Bracelet: Heavenly Dao Numinous Treasure. It is extremely hard and can hit the soul. It can encircle a world.]
 Heavenly Dao Numinous Treasure was not bad!
 Han Jue silently took out the Heavenly Origin Bracelet and started to make it recognize him as its owner.
 As for Dharma treasures, the more the better, even if they were useless now.
 For example, in the Investiture of the Gods, the Three Pure Ones would often give their disciples Dharma treasures and let them fight. It was quite impressive.
 However, Han Jue would never hand over his strongest Dharma treasures. Only those that he did not like could be given to his disciples.
 Several days later, the Dharma treasure successfully recognized him as its owner. Han Jue directly put it on his right wrist.
 He continued cultivating and checked his emails.
 (Your good friend Ji Xianshen has obtained a Pseudo-Sage Divine Arm. His cultivation has increased greatly.)
 (Your good friend Pan Xin was attacked by a Human School cultivator] x392
 [Your Dao Companion Xuan Qingjun has obtained the Primordial Purple Qi. Her providence has increased greatly.]
 [Your good friend Empress Houtu established the Netherworld.)
 (Your good friend Jiang Dugu was attacked by the Ancient Master of Calamity and was severely injured.]
 (Your good friend Heavenly Emperor has become a Pseudo-Sage.]
 (Your disciple Yang Tiandong has become the King of Hell.)
 This did not seem to be the first time Ji Xianshen had fused with limbs. What was he doing?
 From the looks of it, he seemed to be turning into a Heavenly Dao villain!
 Han Jue was stunned when he saw Xuan Qingjun obtain the Primordial Purple Qi. So it was because of her that the Primordial Purple Qi descended into the Immortal World.
 How did she do it?
 The Heavenly Emperor had actually become a Pseudo-Sage!
 Han Jue only sighed and was not shocked. Ever since he went to the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End, the Heavenly Emperor had endless opportunities. He was a Zenith Heaven cultivator himself, so it was not strange for him to become a Pseudo-Sage.
 Yang Tiandong became the King of Hell…
 Empress Houtu was rather impressive. She really knew how to act in order to tie Han Jue to her.
 On the surface, Empress Houtu was expressing her goodwill to Han Jue, so he couldn’t say anything.
 Yang Tiandong died in the previous calamity and was protected by Qiu Xilai. His soul had always been in the netherworld, but he did not expect Empress Houtu to support him to become the King of Hell.
 Speaking of his eldest disciple, Han Jue sighed.
 What a pity.
 Han Jue shook his head and laughed.
 He believed that one day, Empress Houtu would make Yang Tiandong find him. At that time, he would directly purify him!
 Thinking of Absolute Purification, Han Jue stood up and prepared to purify all the new disciples of the Hidden Sect, just in case.
 Even Li Daokong and Li Xuan’ao had to be purified!
 Just like that, Han Jue wandered around the Hundred Peak Immortal River, causing a commotion in the entire sect. The disciples wanted to see him but were afraid of meeting him.
 Han Jue used small talk to purify them secretly one by one.
 The lifespan consumed was not worth mentioning. It wasn’t enough to make a Sage go mad.
 Sixty years later.
 All the disciples had seen Han Jue before. Not only did their reverence for him not decrease, but it also increased.
 Han Jue’s aura was too strong. In addition to the Sun and Moon Yin-Yang Protection, even if they had chatted, they didn’t know his true appearance.
 Mysterious.
 Powerful.
 This was Han Jue’s image in the hearts of the in-name disciples.
