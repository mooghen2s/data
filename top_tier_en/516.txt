 Since Empress Houtu was willing to support the Hidden Sect, he did not have to be too wary.
 Who in the Immortal World would be his match when he became a Sage?
 Empress Houtu and Han Jue chatted for a while more. It was nothing much and could be considered polite.
 After the dream ended.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and discovered that Qingluan’er had unknowingly appeared beside him.
 She was already used to Han Jue being lost in thought. She leaned on his shoulder and sighed softly. “Husband, do you think Tuo’er can survive?”
 Han Jue smiled secretly as he thought, With the cultivation technique you taught him, don’t you know?
 Qingluan’er was not an ordinary person and had a special bloodline, but it wasn’t passed down to Han Tuo. How could her bloodline compare to Han Jue’s?
 cu
 Although her background was not simple, Qingluan’er indeed didn’t have a cultivation level. Han Jue had deduced that she had been cursed when she was young. The other party’s cultivation level was only at the Grand Unity True Immortal Realm. Furthermore, the one who had been cursed was not her, but her parents.
 If not for meeting him, she would have died in the snow.
 Han Jue said, “It’s fine. If he’s dead, we’ll make another one.”
 Qingluan’er glared and rebuked him. “What are you saying!”
 “I’m just teasing you. Don’t worry. He’s a lucky fellow. I’ll protect him.”
 “Sigh, what a pity. He doesn’t have cultivation potential. It’s all my fault…”
 Qingluan’er fell into self-blame. Han Jue didn’t ask why it was all her fault. He knew what happened to her just by calculating with his fingers. He didn’t even use the derivation function.
 Han Jue looked up at the snow outside the city.
 A little fellow was approaching the Eastern Guard City.
 The danger of the Eastern Guard City was coming
 Boom
 A huge stone descended from the sky and smashed onto the city wall. The city wall shook violently and rubble flew everywhere. More than ten soldiers were injured and four of them turned into meat patties.
 Not far away, Han Tuo’s face turned pale and his body trembled.
 He had inherited Han Jue’s appearance and was extremely outstanding among the surrounding soldiers. However, when facing life and death, he was also extremely flustered.
 Although he had always been tempering his body, he rarely had the chance to fight.
 He turned around and saw a huge figure approaching amidst the flying snow. The blurry figure looked as if it came from the netherworld. It was terrifying and brought despair.
 “An Earth Immortal Realm ferocious beast! Everyone, be careful. Its fire can burn souls!” an Immortal Master on a distant tower shouted in horror.
 His words terrified the soldiers on the city wall. The cultivators in the sky also fled in fear of being targeted.
 Below the city wall, there was a continuous stream of ferocious beasts. These ferocious beasts were not big.
 It had been nearly thirty thousand years since the Heavenly Dao had been restarted. The first batch of Connate lifeforms and ferocious beasts had already given birth to descendants. The potential of the second generation of living beings was inferior to the first generation. Their bloodline and talent conflicted after generation after generation, causing more and more ordinary living beings to appear.
 Of course, most living beings were still very strong. Because the humans were weak, powerful people disdained to find trouble with them, or they knew that the humans had a background. Those who found trouble with the humans were basically all ferocious beasts and Connate races at the bottom rung of the Immortal World.
 Even so, the Human Race could no longer expand.
 It was common to see such a situation.
 Han Tuo looked at the battle ahead. He gripped the iron spear in his hand tightly and pushed the beasts that kept charging up the city wall down.
 As the battle continued, Han Tuo gradually became numb.
 This battle lasted for an unknown period of time. Every time Han Tuo felt that he was about to die, the attacks of the ferocious beasts would coincidentally miss.
 Han Tuo felt that he was in a daze. The long battle made him extremely tormented. Perhaps he wanted to die deep down.
 After the battle ended, the City Lord announced that the soldiers at the front line could go home and rest.
 Han Tuo returned home covered in injuries. He only nodded in a daze when the servants greeted him.
 Unknowingly, he arrived in the courtyard and discovered that his father was still staring at the sky like a stone statue.
 Han Jue felt his gaze and looked down at him with a smile.
 Han Tuo was stunned for a moment before his heart warmed.
 Why did he want to fight? He wanted to protect this family!
 Han Tuo knelt down in front of him and cupped his fists. “Father! I’ve returned alive!”
 Looking at his excited expression, Han Jue smiled and reached out to touch his head.
 “It’s been hard on you,” Han Jue said softly.
 Han Tuo couldn’t stand the injustice and immediately wailed.
 He was still a child, after all.
 Han Jue pulled him into his arms and accompanied him in silence.
 After a long while…
 Han Tuo looked up and asked, “Father, you don’t seem to be afraid of the danger Eastern Guard City is facing.”
 Ever since he was young, he had never seen his father panic. He was clearly an ordinary person without any cultivation potential. Why was he so calm?
 He even felt that his father was more mature than the Immortal Masters he had seen.
 Han Jue replied, “What’s the use of being afraid? Can that help the Human Race eliminate the ferocious beasts?”
 Han Tuo could only think that he was carefree.
 “Don’t you want to cultivate? Why do you want to join the army?” Han Jue suddenly asked.
 Stunned, Han Tuo said, “I wanted to cultivate, but the Eastern Guard City was attacked, so I had no choice but to join the
 army!”
 Han Jue asked, “Since you want to cultivate, why fight for this city? Cultivation is the path to longevity. You will encounter many such situations. You can’t save everyone. How can you guarantee that you will live until the end?”
 Han Tuo was stunned again. He had indeed not thought of this question.
 “But isn’t it natural for humans to help other humans?” Han Tuo asked in surprise.
 “Why should we?”
 “I…”
 “You might think that you are born of the Human Race, so you want to save them. In the future, if something happens to the region where the Eastern Guard City is guarding, won’t you save a region? In the future, if something happens to the Immortal World, won’t you save the Immortal World? Furthermore, if something happens to the Heavenly Dao, won’t you fight for the Heavenly Dao?” Han Jue asked question after question, causing Han Tuo to become speechless.
 It sounded reasonable. Han Tuo followed Han Jue’s line of thought and couldn’t help but feel his scalp tingle.
 Too tiring!
 Although Han Tuo was kind, he was not that noble.
RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only Han Jue said earnestly, “If you really have the heart to cultivate the Dao, leave as soon as possible. The calamity of Eastern Guard City won’t end. You’re insignificant now. It’s better for you to go out and train. You can return to protect the city when you are stronger.”
 With that, Han Jue closed his eyes and continued to comprehend the world.
 The so-called comprehending the world was actually prying into the myriad worlds of the mortal world.
 Han Tuo stood where he was for a long time before finally leaving.
 Five years later.
 Han Jue was drinking in the courtyard when he suddenly saw figures flying over.
 One of them was Ji Xianshen.
 They hung high above the sea of clouds. Other than Han Jue, no one discovered them.
 An old immortal beside Ji Xianshen said, “This city has the bloodline of the Green Phoenix Race. Although it’s weak, we can rope them in. Furthermore, they’ve been through war all year round and are suffering. If the Heavenly Ancestor lends a hand, they will definitely be grateful.”
 Ji Xianshen frowned. “The potential of the people in this city is too poor. I won’t appear. Any one of you can go and preach. The others will follow me to the next city.”
