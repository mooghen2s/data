 Sage Jin’an frowned. His expression changed.
 He also wanted to get rid of Han Jue, but his instincts told him that the other party was very difficult to deal with!
 He might even be harder to deal with than Li Muyi!
 The figure in the mirror said, “We have to do it even if it’s difficult. Otherwise, don’t even think about transcending the Heavenly Dao. You will always be a puppet of the Heavenly Dao.”
 Sage Jin’an’s expression turned ugly.
 He could only grit his teeth and agree.
 After preaching for a hundred years, Han Jue quietly stood up and left.
 The effect of a Sage’s lecture was on another level. A large number of disciples broke through while listening to the Dao.
 Han Jue sat on the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus. He took out the Book of Misfortune and started cursing Qiu Xilai.
 This fellow had tried to affect him when he was attaining the Dao. He had to teach him a lesson!
 Han Jue cursed as he checked his emails regularly. (Your good friend Ji Xianshen has stepped into the River of Destiny.]
 (Your grand-disciple Fang Liang’s soul passed through the primordial era and was stopped by the ancient Master of Calamity. He was severely injured.)
 (Your good friend Huang Zuntian was attacked by Jie School cultivators] X7829
 (Your son Han Tuo has received guidance from your good friend Zhang Guxing. His cultivation has increased greatly.]
 (Your good friend Li Daokong has comprehended a Mystical Power in the Dao Lecture. His cultivation has increased greatly.)
 [Your disciple Zhou Fan obtained your good friend Seven Dao Sage’s dream. His comprehension has increased greatly.]
 [Your good friend Jing Tiangong has stepped into the Pseudo-Sage Realm.]
 Han Jue watched with relish. Fang Liang had been jumping around in the Primordial Era and was finally punished. It was fine as long as he was not dead.
 Who was this ancient Master of Calamity?
 Han Jue decided to calculate after the curse ended.
 He sighed when he saw Zhang Guxing’s name.
 He recalled the past.
 He did not expect him and his son to have the same fate.
 Han Jue wasn’t worried that something would happen to Han Tuo. If something really happened, he could also predict that no matter how far away it was, he could still save him.
 As long as it didn’t harm his soul, Han Jue wouldn’t act even if he died.
 True experts could only rely on themselves!
 Han Jue didn’t want Han Tuo to think of him when he encountered trouble.
 He still liked him very much. He hoped that he could grow up well. It was also a good thing if he could become a great figure of the Hidden Sect in the future.
Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels Han Jue also noticed that Zhou Fan had obtained the dream of the Seven Dao Sage. He had to be wary about this.
 Seven Dao Sage was an existence on the same level as Ancestor Xitian. He couldn’t be underestimated.
 Five days later, Han Jue put down the Book of Misfortune.
 He first deduced who the ancient Master of Calamity was.
 (4 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Four billion years?
 This was already Li Muyi’s value!
 Han Jue frowned and silently chose to continue.
 A figure appeared in his mind, and lines of words appeared in front of him.
 (Jin Shen: Perfected Pseudo-Sage, ancient Master of Calamity. He controls the providence of the Heavenly Dao and is responsible for activating the Immeasurable Calamity. His cultivation has already surpassed that of a Pseudo-Sage. Because his position as a Heavenly Dao Sage is perfected, he has never been able to become a Sage. He is hidden in the Dark Forbidden Zone all year round and prying into the Immortal World.]
 Jin Shen?
 Why hadn’t he heard of him before?
 It was actually the existence in charge of activating the calamity. Amazing.
 Then, Han Jue began to deduce the Seven Dao Sage.
 “Why did the Seven Dao Sage guide Zhou Fan?”
 (14 trillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 So high!
 Han Jue’s eyelids twitched. He could only choose to continue.
 [Seven Dao Sage is preparing for his tribulation. He is not only guiding Zhou Fan, but he also has no designs on you for the time being.)
 Preparing for his tribulation?
 What tribulation would such an existence face?
 Han Jue was curious. But since the Seven Dao Sage didn’t want to harm him, he didn’t care.
 After resting for a few days, Han Jue took out the Book of Misfortune again and started cursing Sage Jin’an.
 Sage Jin’an had a five-star hatred towards him. He wouldn’t rest until the other party was dead.
 Han Jue couldn’t be bothered to calculate the reason. In any case, this fellow didn’t know the Dao Destruction Mystical Power. He would kill him before this fellow took action!
 Five days later.
 Han Jue’s lifespan began to decrease.
 Far away in the Dao Field, Sage Jin’an frowned.
 He had doubted Han Jue regarding the Dark Forbidden Lord, but he had never harmed him. Why would Han Jue want to harm him?
 From the current situation, Han Jue was clearly afraid of karma and trouble.
 The Dark Forbidden Lord should be one of the other Sages.
 This time, the Dark Forbidden Lord came menacingly. The curse power far exceeded before.
 Sage Jin’an had been cursed before, but it didn’t affect him much. He wasn’t even sure if it was the Dark Forbidden Lord.
 He had only deduced a book.
 “There are rumors in the Immortal World that the true Dark Forbidden Lord uses a book. If I can’t deduce this book and didn’t deduce it when I was cursed, this means that the other party is not the Dark Forbidden Lord. It seems that no matter who the Dark Forbidden Lord is, some Sages are indeed plotting.”
 Sage Jin’an’s eyes flickered with killing intent.
 He believed that he had never offended anyone. To actually attract the curse of a Sage, it could be said to be an undeserved calamity.
 Furious, he circulated his energy to resist the curse.
 The curse power of the Dark Forbidden Lord was truly terrifying and was still increasing.
 After a while, Sage Jin’an couldn’t take it anymore. He suddenly stood up and disappeared from the hall.
 He found Li Muyi.
 “Senior! Someone cursed me!” Sage Jin’an appeared in front of Li Muyi and said anxiously. He then meditated and continued to circulate his energy to resist.
 Li Muyi frowned and immediately called South Extreme Heavenly Venerate and Sect Master Tian Jue over.
 The two Sages frowned when they arrived and witnessed Sage Jin’an’s situation.
 Li Muyi stood up and used his Dharmic powers to help Sage Jin’an.
 He said in a low voice, “Currently, we can be certain that the Dark Forbidden Lord is not among us. We have to put down our doubts.”
 South Extreme Heavenly Venerate and Sect Master Tian Jue had ugly expressions. Who was it?
 If not for Li Muyi calling them over, they might have doubted each other in the future.
 Such intentions were punishable!
 Too sinister!
 “Oh no, come quickly!” Li Muyi’s expression changed drastically as he shouted.
 Sage Jin’an’s face darkened and his body trembled. Wisps of black aura visible to the naked eye wrapped around him.
 South Extreme Heavenly Venerate and Sect Master Tian Jue hurriedly reacted. The three Sages helped Sage Jin’an resist the curse.
 Inside the Daoist temple.
 Han Jue’s expression was extremely ugly.
 His lifespan had already decreased by 40 trillion years!
 It was about to reach the level of Sage Fated Secrets!
 The key was that his cultivation level had increased, the Book of Misfortune had increased, and he had consumed so much lifespan.
 Could it be that Sage Jin’an was stronger than Sage Fated Secrets?
 No!
 Other Sages had to be helping him.
 “I don’t believe it. I’ll curse you until you’re crippled even if the Heavenly Dao helps!”
 Han Jue’s eyes turned ruthless. He was already a Sage, yet Sage Jin’an still dared to hate him. Five-star Hatred Points was definitely dangerous. As long as Sage Jin’an was given a chance, Han Jue would be dead.
 45 trillion years!
 50 trillion years!
 60 trillion years!
 (Because of your curse, the Sage Heart of your enemy, Sage Jin’an, cracked. Fortunately, your enemy Li Muyi helped.]
 (Because of your curse, the Sage Heart of your enemy, Sage Jin’an, cracked. Fortunately, your enemy Sect Master Tian Jue helped.)
 [Because of your curse, the Sage Heart of your enemy, Sage Jin’an, cracked. Fortunately, your enemy South Extreme Heavenly Venerate helped.]
 Han Jue still didn’t stop after seeing these three emails.
 Continue cursing!
