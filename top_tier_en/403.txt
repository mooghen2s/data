 Seeing this notification, Han Jue’s depression vanished.
 If not for the fact that it affected Jade Emperor Zhou Yan, how could it increase hatred?
 If 40 billion years of lifespan didn’t even ruin the other party’s mood, wouldn’t that be a huge loss?
 Han Jue adjusted his state of mind.
 He was hiding in the Dark Forbidden Zone now. Jade Emperor Zhou Yan shouldn’t be able to find him.
 However, he couldn’t expose his identity to prevent Jade Emperor Zhou Yan from using his friends to threaten him.
 Several days later.
 Han Jue recovered. He began to improve his Mystical Power and let his strength reach its current limit.
 A year later.
 Han Jue started the simulation trial and fought Li Xuan’ao.
 Instant kill!
 He could kill Li Daokong in ten breaths!
 He could kill the Heavenly Emperor in an hour!
CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m He could kill Xue Minghe in five minutes!
 Han Jue challenged all the listeners in the Great Ultimate Hall. No one in the Deity Realm was his match. Some weaker Zenith Heavens were also killed by him.
 Zenith Heaven Mystical Power, Stellar Primordial Body, 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus!
 This was the reason why Han Jue could cross realms to kill enemies!
 The difference between the Six Mystic Divine Origin and the Five Mystic Divine Origin was extremely great. Not only were there a lot of Dharmic powers, but it was also the essence of Dharmic powers.
 Han Jue had already vaguely come into contact with the Zenith Heaven Realm.
 This realm comprehended the Great Dao.
 Although the twelve Ancestral Magi did not have an essence soul, their bodies cultivated a Great Dao Origins. They could still reach the Zenith Heaven Realm or even higher.
 Han Jue prepared to comprehend the Great Dao of Life and Death and break through to the Zenith Heaven Realm.
 It was only because Ancestor Xitian had taught him the Great Dao of Karma. If Ancestor Xitian developed ill intentions in the future, wouldn’t he become his puppet by cultivating this Great Dao?
 “Wait, why can’t I create a brand new Great Dao?”
 Han Jue suddenly had a bold thought.
 However, he quickly abandoned this thought.
 He couldn’t rely on himself unless he gathered all nine Great Dao Fragments! Currently, he had only accumulated one. Who knew how long it would take him to accumulate nine Great Dao Fragments? “Six thousand years old and the Zenith Heaven Realm should be enough for one fragment.”
 Han Jue thought silently. Before that, he still had to rely on the Great Dao of Life and Death.
 Just like that, Han Jue began to comprehend the Great Dao of Life and Death and rushed to the Zenith Heaven Realm. While he was in seclusion, the Immortal World was in chaos.
 The former Heavenly Emperor, Jade Emperor Zhou Yan, had appeared. He directly suppressed the Heavenly Court and controlled the nine heavens.
 He personally appeared to suppress the various factions.
 Dragon Court, defeated.
 The True Dragon Race was defeated.
 Darkness Sect, defeated.
 The Qilin Race was defeated.
 The Human Race’s Sacred Dynasty was defeated.
 Everyone was in an uproar!
 Jade Emperor Zhou Yan used his supreme Dharmic powers to bring despair to all living beings.
 In the broken Heavenly Emperor Palace, Fang Liang sat on a mat. Two figures knelt in front of him.
 They were the Heavenly God General and the Martial God General.
 Fang Liang stared at them faintly and said, “You still acknowledge me as the Heavenly Emperor?”
 The Martial God General said in a low voice, “His Majesty is the Heavenly Emperor. You were personally chosen by the previous Heavenly Emperor. It’s truly orthodox!”
 The Heavenly God General added, “You’re the Heavenly Emperor!”
 Fang Liang looked at them and sighed.
 His heart sank at the thought of the Divine General.
 “I’m already Jade Emperor Zhou Yan’s prisoner. Only you can look at me.” Fang Liang smiled bitterly.
 He had yet to become the Heavenly Emperor when he was suppressed. He was filled with unwillingness.
 The Martial God General said in a low voice, “Jade Emperor Zhou Yan is too much. He’s humiliating the Heavenly Court!”
 The Heavenly God General was expressionless and did not reply.
 Fang Liang took a deep breath and said, “I need you to do something.” The Martial God General asked, “What is it?” “Go to Kunlun and inform the Sages of the Heavenly Court’s situation.”
 “Alright!”
 The Martial God General agreed.
 In a dark cave.
 Xue Minghe was nailed to the ground by the seven white jade swords and could not move. Countless members of the Darkness Sect gathered in the distance. Duan Hongchen, Xuan Qingjun, and Mo Fuchou were among them.
 Everyone looked at a figure. That person was surrounded by clouds, and he was sitting on a dragon throne. His posture was arrogant and his eyes were disdainful. His black robe fluttered slightly.
 It was Jade Emperor Zhou Yan. Jade Emperor Zhou Yan frowned. He had deduced for a long time but still had not deduced the relationship between Xue Minghe and the Dark Forbidden Lord.
 “Who is the Dark Forbidden Lord?”
 Jade Emperor Zhou Yan’s gaze landed on Xue Minghe.
 Xue Minghe gritted his teeth, his eyes filled with fear.
 Although he worshiped the Dark Forbidden Lord, he was even more afraid of death.
 He said in a low voice, “I really don’t know where the Dark Forbidden Lord is!”
 Jade Emperor Zhou Yan said, “Do you want to live?”
 “Yes!”
 “Tell your disciples to curse the humans.” “What?”
 Xue Minghe was shocked. The Human Race was the protagonist of the Heavenly Dao. It was fine to curse some people, but cursing the entire Human Race was courting death. Jade Emperor Zhou Yan’s eyes turned cold. The temperature in the cave decreased to a freezing point, causing everyone to shiver. Xue Minghe could only force himself to agree.
 Jade Emperor Zhou Yan dissipated in the air, leaving behind a light sentence. “There are three thousand Great Dao, but only a chance of survival. It depends on whether you can grasp it.”
 The seven white jade swords on Xue Minghe’s body vanished.
 He cursed silently. “Bastard, if not for the fact that I can’t defeat you…”
 He could only pray that the Dark Forbidden Lord would avenge him.
 Nineteen years had passed since he began comprehending the Great Dao of Life and Death.
 Han Jue was still immersed in comprehending the Dao when he was suddenly interrupted by a system notification.
 [Detected that Jade Emperor Zhou Yan wants to forcefully advance the calamity and harm the Heavenly Dao’s providence. You have the following choices:)
 (1: Immediately ascend and say that you want to compete with Jade Emperor Zhou Yan to bring hope to all living beings. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment, a Mystical Power inheritance, a chance to upgrade the Dao Field, a Supreme Treasure inheritance, a random natural treasure, and a Heavenly Dao Spirit Stone.)
 [2: Continue cultivating and stay away from trouble. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment and a Heavenly Dao Spirit Stone.]
 Han Jue cursed silently.
 This option was completely demonic.
 However, how could he dare to compete with Jade Emperor Zhou Yan?
 Wasn’t that courting death!
 Han Jue could only choose the second option.
 It wasn’t a loss. It was what he needed, anyway. [You chose to continue cultivating and obtained a Great Dao Fragment and a Heavenly Dao Spirit Stone.)
 Han Jue placed the Strange Deity into the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus, then took out the Book of Misfortune and the Heavenly Dao Spirit Stone.
 As long as he was cursing, he would imprison the Strange Deity, just in case.
 “Since you’re so arrogant, I’ll fight you!”
 Han Jue thought to himself that he was going to be the savior again and no one would know his contributions.
 It was really lonely.
 Han Jue began to fuse the two treasures.
 The Book of Misfortune was a Deity Realm Supreme Treasure before. After raising it, it could reach the Zenith Heaven Realm no matter what. At that time, the curse power would increase by leaps and bounds.
 Han Jue was looking forward to it.
 He checked his emails as he fused.
 (Your grand-disciple Fang Liang was attacked by your enemy Jade Emperor Zhou Yan. He was severely injured.]
 (Your good friend Xue Minghe was attacked by your enemy Jade Emperor Zhou Yan. He was severely injured.)
 (Your good friend Di Lantian was attacked by your enemy Jade Emperor Zhou Yan. He was severely injured.]
 (Your disciple Long Hao was attacked by your enemy Jade Emperor Zhou Yan. He was severely injured.]
 (Your good friend Immortal Emperor Samsara was attacked by your enemy Jade Emperor Zhou Yan. He was severely injured.)
 Han Jue frowned as he read.
 Was this how this fellow planned to advance the calamity?
