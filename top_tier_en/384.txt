 He couldn’t offend such a person rashly.
 At the very least, he could not curse him. Jade Emperor Zhou Yan was definitely stronger than Zenith Heaven and might even be a Sage.
 Such an existence could not be cursed to death. It would attract his attention in advance.
 “I have to think of a way to let him be exposed. Such an existence will definitely cause panic among the people. I don’t believe that all the forces in the Immortal World are his henchmen.”
 Han Jue thought like this. If it was true, he could only run.
 At most, he would run to the Dark Forbidden Zone!
 If I can’t win, why can’t I escape?
 The more Han Jue thought about it, the more relaxed he became.
 Nothing in the world was difficult as long as one was willing to give up. There were no powerful enemies in the world as long as one knew how to hide.
 Han Jue perked up and continued cultivating.
 He would be surrounded only after the calamity ended. Currently, there was no sign of the calamity ending.
 Year after year passed.
 The Nine Nether Purgatory regained its silence. The Vermilion Bird Race and the Jie School seemed to have reached a peaceful agreement and no longer fought.
 What Han Jue was worried about didn’t happen. No third force entered the Nine Nether Purgatory. In the blink of an eye, another thirty years passed.
 From the emails, there was another bloodbath in the Immortal World. Han Jue’s friends kept decreasing and had not increased for many years. The recent new friends were Xue Minghe and Jing Tiangong.
 At this rate, Han Jue would be unable to spy on the situation in the Immortal World sooner or later. However, there was no choice. It was not suitable to make friends during the calamity.
 Han Jue was getting closer and closer to the Four Mystic Divine Origin. He would probably break through in another fifty years.
 It was mainly because the negative karma in the Nine Nether Purgatory was too dense and endless. No matter how fast Han Jue absorbed negative karma, he could absorb it as much as he wanted.
 Although the negative karma absorbed every day was extremely huge, Han Jue felt that he didn’t affect the Nine Nether Purgatory at all.
 On this day.
 Han Jue was cultivating.
 With a terrifying boom, he opened his eyes in shock.
 He wasn’t the only one. Everyone from the Hidden Sect was shocked and stood up.
 Above the Nine Nether Purgatory, a huge red hole appeared in the darkness. A terrifying figure slowly descended.
 It was a 30km tall figure with three heads and six arms. He wore savage bone armor and a huge pillar that held up the sky floated behind him. It was even larger than his body.
 He opened his eyes and smiled in horror towards a certain direction.
Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com He raised his right hand, and the huge pillar behind him flew to his palm.
 “Break!”
 The ten thousand foot figure roared angrily. He waved his right hand and the towering pillar attacked, stirring up a dragon wave.
 A terrifying impact swept towards the surroundings, and boundless negative karma surged violently.
 The Hidden Sect Island was also shaken by the impact. Fortunately, the spatial array formation in the Dao Field was stable. They couldn’t sense the island’s trembling when inside.
 Han Jue was surprised. Who was that?
 Because the distance was too far, he couldn’t detect the other party’s cultivation and identity.
 That direction seemed to be targeting the Primordial Yuan Phoenix!
 Han Jue didn’t care too much.
 It was fine as long as it did not affect him.
 He sent a voice transmission to everyone from the Hidden Sect, telling them to calm down.
 Soon, the pressure of battle came. Han Jue secretly controlled Hidden Sect Island to leave the direction of the battle. The battle lasted for several days.
 After the battle ended, Han Jue checked the emails.
 (Your good friend Primordial Yuan Phoenix was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure and was severely injured.)
 Gasp
 To be able to injure an existence like the Primordial Yuan Phoenix, how strong was that fellow?
 Was this the hidden side of the world?
 There were countless people like Han Jue hiding in the dark!
 “Eh? Spatial array formation? Which fellow Daoist is on the island?”
 A surprised voice suddenly sounded and entered Hidden Sect Island.
 Han Jue was shocked and hurriedly checked the surrounding enemies.
 (Jiang Dugu: Cultivation unknown. Immeasurable Emperor, Connate Human Race] His cultivation level was unknown!
 He was at least Zenith Heaven!
 Han Jue knew that he couldn’t hide, so he said, “I’m a nobody. I hope that you won’t disturb me.”
 With all the disciples watching, he couldn’t lower his stance.
 Besides, the Dao Field’s array formation was already at the Zenith Heaven Realm. Ordinary Zenith Heaven cultivators couldn’t barge in. Even if they could, there was still Lü Bu, a peak Zenith Heaven.
 Jiang Dugu’s voice sounded, “I’m just curious. I naturally won’t disturb your Dao Field. May I know your name?”
 Han Jue said, “Xing Daorong.” “Xing Daorong? Where are you from? I’m Jiang Dugu of the Human Race. I’m currently in the Human School, staying away from the calamity.”
 “I’m from the Great Wei Divine Dynasty, a mortal world hidden in the dark. It’s not worth mentioning.” “Are you avoiding the calamity? I’ve never heard of you, which means that you’ve never entered the calamity. Why don’t you fight?” “I cultivate for myself. People fight for providence to defeat others, that is not my Dao.”
 “Hahaha, not bad. I won’t disturb you anymore.”
 (Jiang Dugu has a favorable impression of you. Current favorability: 1.5 stars]
 Jiang Dugu’s aura disappeared, and Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief.
 He immediately checked the other party’s information.
 (Jiang Dugu: Cultivation unknown. Immeasurable Emperor, Connate Human Race, the first batch of Connate Humans created by Sage Nüwa. He once obtained great providence in the Immeasurable Calamity. He is now one of the ancestors of the Human Race and is currently cultivating in the Human School. Because of your rare cultivation attitude, he has a favorable impression of you. Current favorability: 1.5 stars]
 Han Jue showed a frown.
 Human School…
 It turned out that Li Daokong and Li Xuan’ao were not the only ones in the Human School. There were also Connate Humans hidden among them. The current humans were not considered Connate Humans. They were only considered Postnatal Humans. Connate Humans were the creation of Sages and were extremely talented.
 The reason why the Human Race could prosper today was not only because of the favor of the Sages but also because of the relentless efforts of the Connate Human Race. After the battle of blood and tears, they had obtained the status of the protagonists of the Heavenly Dao.
 Because of this identity, they were under the Heavenly Dao’s protection. Killing humans was considered a sin while saving humans was a form of kindness and merit.
 How many Connate Humans like Jiang Dugu were there in the Human Race?
 Han Jue hesitated.
 Everyone from the Hidden Sect was also communicating “Jiang Dugu is a Pseudo-Sage. His seniority is extremely high.” Duan Hongchen sighed. Although he was only an Immortal Emperor, he had lived for a long time and knew countless names.
 Jiang Yi said angrily, “What Xing Daorong! Back then, he even lied to me that his name was Sima Yi. I’m so angry!”
 The Black Hell Chicken asked curiously, “Your surnames are both Jiang. Is there a story?”
 Jiang Yi nodded and said, “My mother’s ancestor was once saved by the human Jiang family and was raised. Therefore, she has the surname Jiang. Speaking of which, I’m also a descendant of Jiang Dugu, but our relationship is too far apart. He definitely won’t acknowledge me, and I don’t want to either.” The Black Hell Demon Lord asked curiously, “Is Jiang Dugu stronger than Zu Tu?”
 The system created Zu Tu, who had not spoken, said, “He is. No matter how strong Zu Tu is, he’s still tied down by the Immeasurable Calamity. Jiang Dugu has once won the providence of the calamity for the Human Race and has often heard the Sage of the Human School preach. Compared to that, Zu Tu’s status is too shallow.”
 Everyone couldn’t help but sigh.
 There were really many mighty figures hidden in the Immortal World!
