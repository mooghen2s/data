 Han Jue increasingly felt that the existences above were unfathomable.
 He was also curious about the impression and effect of this variable in the Sages’ eyes.
 He clearly felt that Li Muyi looked down on him. Although Nüwa wanted to rope him in, she did not have a good impression of him.
 Could it be that Sages were really heartless?
 Impossible!
 How could they be impartial?
 Ever since he experienced this calamity, Han Jue felt that Sages were fighting for benefits and didn’t even care about people’s lives. It could be said that they were extremely selfish.
 Han Jue shook his head and stopped thinking about this. Then, he thought of Huang Zuntian and Su Qi. Should he visit their dreams?
 Su Qi was in the Dark Forbidden Zone, so he should be fine.
 Huang Zuntian’s current identity was sensitive. Han Jue did not want to visit his dreams. In addition to Jing Tiangong’s existence, it would not be good if he was connected to the identity of the Dark Forbidden Lord.
 Han Jue stopped the technique and continued cultivating
 This was all he could do.
 Next, he waited for the calamity to descend.
 Forty years passed in a flash.
 Han Jue still cursed once every ten years. Although Jade Emperor Zhou Yan had become a Heavenly Devil, his portrait was still there, so Han Jue had to keep cursing him.
 All these years, he had not left the cave abode and cultivated in peace. His cultivation had improved greatly.
 Han Jue couldn’t understand the Immortal World because it had always been the humans and the Heavenly Court fighting. The news of the war filled his emails. Other than the war, he couldn’t see any other news.
 On this day, Han Jue finally felt Xing Hongxuan using the Invocation Technique.
 To be safe, he still deduced first.
 After spending a hundred million years of his lifespan and confirming that Xing Hongxuan was not being watched, he rushed to the Immortal World’s void.
 Passing through the dark vortex, Han Jue saw Xing Hongxuan.
 She wore a white dress and was dazzling. She was beautiful and devastatingly beautiful.
 Seeing him appear, Xing Hongxuan immediately flew over and smiled. “Let’s go.”
 Han Jue nodded and put her into his sleeve. Then, he stepped into the black vortex and returned to the Connate Cave Abode.
 After Han Jue released Xing Hongxuan, he began to control Hidden Sect Island to move. Although the Dark Forbidden Zone was very safe, it was good to be careful. Xing Hongxuan wandered around the cave abode and sighed. “This place still hasn’t changed even after so many years.” The Strange Deity sized her up curiously, surprised that she had come out of Han Jue’s body.
 “Your cave abode is still there. Go,” Han Jue said.
 Xing Hongxuan came up to him, her beautiful eyes filled with excitement. She covered her mouth and laughed. “Husband, we…”
 “I’m not free!”
 “Fine.”
 Xing Hongxuan curled her lips and could only leave.
 Han Jue was busy running away and didn’t have the time to do those things with her.
 Xing Hongxuan attracted everyone’s attention as she walked out of the cave abode.
 She had already changed her appearance after reincarnation. No one could recognize her.
 The Black Hell Chicken was the first to recognize her. It remembered Xing Hongxuan’s aura, or more accurately, her soul aura.
 After Xing Hongxuan’s identity was exposed, everyone was shocked. After understanding it, they muttered in their hearts.
 She can even increase her potential like this? Chu Shiren guessed, “It shouldn’t be as simple as just a reincarnation.”
 He guessed that it might be related to Empress Houtu. Otherwise, how could she have been born with such a great background so quickly?
 Diamond Rage and Tu Ling’er were from the Magus Race. It was understandable that Empress Houtu helped Han Jue. The Black Hell Chicken looked at the Three-Headed Wyrm King and said, “Do you want to reincarnate?”
 The Three-Headed Wyrm King said angrily, “I don’t need it!”
 The current him was already at the bottom of the Hidden Sect. He had already guessed that the Black Hell Chicken was mocking him.
 Xing Hongxuan didn’t stay for long. She quickly left, while the others continued to chat.
 An hour later.
 Han Jue stopped the Hidden Sect Island.
 He exhaled, the uneasiness in his heart finally subsiding.
 Xing Hongxuan had returned from the Human Race. Even if they lost, it had nothing to do with Han Jue.
 As for his other good friends, Han Jue had already advised them anyway. If they really died, he could only pray for them in the endless and boring years ahead.
 “If it’s a battle between Sages, it’s best to come later. If not, it’s best to go even earlier.”
 Han Jue thought silently and continued to absorb the negative karma in the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus.
 Half a year later. A line of words suddenly appeared in front of him.
 (Empress Nüwa sent you a dream. Do you accept it?]
 Han Jue wasn’t surprised. He pretended not to see it and continued to absorb negative karma.
 [Empress Nüwa sent you a dream. Do you accept it?] Again?
 Han Jue neither rejected nor accepted it.
 In the following days, Nüwa would try to send him a dream from time to time. It was even more frequent than the Dijun back then.
 He finally pulled Xing Hongxuan out. Han Jue didn’t want to enter the calamity.
 He would attain the Dao in the future. If he encountered Empress Nüwa asking about this, he would pretend not to know.
 The signal of the Dark Forbidden Zone was not?good.
 Ten days later, Nüwa finally gave up.
 Han Jue didn’t receive her hatred, either. As expected of a Sage, she wouldn’t develop emotions without understanding the truth.
 Since he had nothing to do, Han Jue checked the emails.
 (Your grand-disciple Fang Liang was cursed by a mysterious curse.]
 (Your good friend Li Daokong was attacked by your good friend Jiang Dugu and was severely injured.)
 (Your good friend Divine General was attacked by a Deity Realm human and was severely injured.)
 [Your good friend Pan Xin was attacked by a Heavenly Court mighty figure.) [Your disciple Su Qi has broken through his limits and created his own Dao technique.]
Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com (Because of your curse, the killing intent of your enemy Jade Emperor Zhou Yan has increased. He slaughtered humans and was suppressed by the Human Race’s Sage.]
 (Your good friend Zhou Fan has obtained the Human Emperor’s inheritance and joined the human race. His providence has transformed.]
 [Your good friend Mo Fuchou has joined the human race. His providence has transformed.]
 Han Jue was amused upon seeing that Jade Emperor Zhou Yan was suppressed by Fuxitian.
 Bastard!
 Serves you right!
 Han Jue also noticed that Zhou Fan and Mo Fuchou had changed allegiance to the human race.
 These two traitors.
 They were not the only ones. Some immortals had also changed sides.
 If not for the outcome of the calamity, Han Jue really didn’t dare to believe that the Heavenly Court could win. After all, they had too many traitors.
 As he read, Han Jue noticed another email.
 (Your good friend Heavenly Emperor has fused with an inferior Strange Deity. He has regained control of his body and devoured the inferior Strange Deity. He has transformed into a Chaotic Evil Spirit.]
 Was the Heavenly Emperor saved or had he turned to the dark side?
 Han Jue checked the Heavenly Emperor’s portrait and discovered that he was showing a strange and sinister smile. It was evil and terrifying, like a villain who wanted to overturn all living beings.
 Han Jue had no choice but to use the derivation function. “I want to know the outcome of the Heavenly Emperor after the calamity.”
 (2 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 Han Jue’s consciousness fell into the illusion. He arrived at the Numinous Palace. The hall was clean and bright, filled with faint golden light. The Heavenly Emperor, dressed in a black dragon robe, sat on the throne and stared at the sky outside the hall.
 Han Jue turned around and discovered that the sky outside the Numinous Palace was pitch black.
 There was no night in the ninth level of heaven.
