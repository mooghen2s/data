 After a long while…
 The Falling Heavenly Stone suddenly cursed. “Damn it!”
 Han Jue was stunned.
 He wasn’t angry. Instead, he was amused. As expected of a Connate lifeform, its learning ability was indeed very strong.
 Han Jue smiled and asked, “Are you very angry?”
 The Falling Heavenly Stone asked, “If it was you, wouldn’t you be angry?”
 “Then, can I kill you?”
 After receiving Han Jue’s guidance, the Falling Heavenly Stone knew what death meant. It was so frightened that its stone body trembled.
 It said angrily, “I didn’t provoke you!”
 “Then, why are you hiding?”
 “You suddenly appeared out of nowhere. If it were you, wouldn’t you hide?” “Then try?”
 “You… are going too far!”
 “So?”
 The Falling Heavenly Stone wanted to cry. If not for the fact that it was a stone, it would have long cried.
 The Falling Heavenly Stone was stunned.
 Overjoyed, it hurriedly thanked him.
 “Continue to absorb the Spirit Qi of Heaven and Earth. There won’t be any danger in this area.” Han Jue left after saying this.
 With his current identity, there was no need for him to take in a disciple personally.
 In the following period of time, the disciples of the Hidden Sect returned.
 About two hundred years later, all the disciples returned.
 Zhou Fan also returned.
 Han Jue wasn’t surprised. Zhao Xuanyuan had already asked through the Chaotic Domain. Zhou Fan hadn’t entered it at that time.
 After entering the Hundred Peak Immortal River, Zhou Fan looked around in surprise.
 Murong Qi was very surprised to see him. He asked, “Why are you here?”
 Zhou Fan sized him up and was secretly shocked.
 This fellow was already an Immortal Emperor!
 In his memories, Murong Qi was his junior brother in the Jade Pure Sacred Sect.
 “I’m here to visit your Grandmaster,” Zhou Fan replied.
 Zhou Fan’s arrival attracted the attention of the others, and they came over to check.
 He was secretly shocked.
 He couldn’t see through Lü Bu, Ma Chao, and the others. He even saw Jiang Yi.
Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com He had seen Jiang Yi before. At that time, Jiang Yi was high-spirited, a genius whose name shook the Immortal World. He didn’t expect him to have also joined the Hidden Sect.
 Zhou Fan noticed the ten thousand Nether Race beings and was even more shocked.
 The weakest was a Grand Unity Golden Immortal. A few had already reached the Immortal Emperor Realm.
 Impossible!
 The Hidden Sect was already so powerful?
 When Zhou Fan was brought to Han Jue’s Daoist temple, he came back to his senses.
 “Go in by yourself.” Zhao Xuanyuan turned around and left. He still had to hurry up and cultivate.
 Zhou Fan took a deep breath and carefully walked into the Daoist temple.
 A dazzling divine light blinded him, then he saw Han Jue.
 Han Jue sat on the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus. The Sun and Moon Yin-Yang Protection floated behind him like two suns spinning behind him, emitting a bright light.
 Zhou Fan’s heart churned with immense shock.
 He was already at the Two Mystic Divine Origin Realm, but he couldn’t see Han Jue’s true appearance.
 This was even stronger than those unparalleled mighty figures!
 Zhou Fan immediately thought of the Sages.
 When he first saw a Sage, he couldn’t see his true appearance either.
 Han Jue asked, “What? You don’t recognize me anymore?”
 Zhou Fan smiled bitterly. He had suffered a huge blow.
 He felt that his thousands of years of hard work were a joke in front of Han Jue.
 Look at him. He had been cultivating in seclusion, and the difference in their cultivation was becoming greater and greater.
 Zhou Fan forced a smile and said, “Han Jue, you’re really powerful now. You’re about to attain the Dao, right?”
 Han Jue smiled and said, “How can that be? It’s still early. Are you looking for me to join my Hidden Sect?”
 “Sure. Do you want to take me in as your disciple?”
 “It’s not that you can’t, but from now on, you have to go out less.”
 “In your opinion, am I just messing around? The difference in our potential is too great. I can only fight… Sigh!”
 Zhou Fan fell into depression.
 The divine light on Han Jue’s body increased greatly. His voice was unfathomable. “You already have the Chaotic Physique and are no longer the past you. Why don’t you join my Hidden Sect and cultivate in seclusion?”
 Zhou Fan’s future was limitless. If he could repent, he would definitely be a powerful force in the Hidden Sect.
 Zhou Fan fell into a daze.
 Several days later, Zhou Fan walked out of Han Jue’s Daoist temple. He looked up at the blue sky and smiled brightly.
 The Black Hell Chicken flew over and shouted, “Brat, are you still leaving?”
 It remembered Zhou Fan who had visited Han Jue more than eight thousand years ago.
 Zhou Fan also remembered the Black Hell Chicken and smiled. “I’m not leaving. In the future, I’m the eighth disciple of the second generation of the Hidden Sect. Treat me with more respect.”
 “Hehe, I don’t even respect Zhao Xuanyuan. What makes you think I’ll respect you?”
 “Believe it or not, I’ll beat you up!”
 “If you have the ability, go to the simulation trial. You will only be qualified to fight me when you are invincible in the Hidden Sect.”
 “Hmph, that’s what I was thinking,” Zhou Fan said proudly. Han Jue had already pulled him into the simulation trial, and he wanted to try it.
 After bidding farewell to the Black Hell Chicken, Zhou Fan found an empty spot to build a Daoist temple and started the simulation trial.
 The first person he challenged was Han Jue!
 He was insta-killed!
 Zhou Fan was stunned.
 “How can this be!”
 Zhou Fan gritted his teeth. He didn’t believe it and challenged Han Jue again.
 After hundreds of challenges, Zhou Fan was in despair.
 He gave up and began to challenge the other disciples.
 He would challenge the Black Hell Chicken first.
 Damn it!
 Wasn’t this dog-like chicken too weak?
 Why was it so arrogant?
 Just like that, Zhou Fan was obsessed with the simulation trial and could not extricate himself.
 On the other side.
 Zhou Mingyue found the Falling Heavenly Stone and picked it up.
 “Hey, hey, hey, what are you doing?” the Falling Heavenly Stone shouted.
 Zhou Mingyue snorted. “Grandmaster asked me to take you in as my disciple. From now on, you are my disciple. My name is Zhou Mingyue!”
 “I see. What’s your grandmaster’s name?”
 “Han Jue, but you can’t call him by his name.”
 “Han… Jue… From now on, I’ll be called Han Zuitian!”
 “Wow, you’re quite good at cozying up to others. That’s a good name.”
 Zhou Mingyue chuckled. He had no objections to this. Instead, he was very satisfied.
 Not to mention the Falling Heavenly Stone, even he wanted to change his surname to Han. However, without Han Jue’s approval, he was too embarrassed to change it. Furthermore, his master, Chu Shiren, did not allow it.
 The first fifth-generation disciple of the Hidden Sect had appeared. Connate lifeform, Han Zuitian!
 Twenty years later.
 Jiang Yi came to visit Han Jue, who let him in.
 Like Zhou Fan, he was blinded by the strong light of the Sun and Moon Yin-Yang Protection.
 He knelt in front of Han Jue and said, “Sect Master, I can’t break through to the Deity Realm. Can you guide me?”
 What light was this?
 How domineering!
 Jiang Yi secretly decided that he would do the same when he returned.
 Han Jue said, “Then, I’ll preach the Dao for you.”
 Jiang Yi was pleasantly surprised and hurriedly thanked him.
 Han Jue began to preach.
 With Jiang Yi’s potential, breaking through to the Deity Realm was not difficult. He was originally the number one prodigy of the Golden Crow Divine Clan, but he lacked guidance.
 Speaking of which, Zhou Fan surpassed Jiang Yi and reached the Deity Realm ahead of time. This made Han Jue sigh.
 Sometimes, wandering about was still important.
 Unless Jiang Yi’s potential was the same as Han Jue’s and was unparalleled, just cultivating alone was really not comparable to Zhou Fan.
