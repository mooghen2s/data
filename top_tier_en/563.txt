 “Why is this happening!”
 “Why!”
 The mysterious existence roared in Han Tuo’s mind in extreme fear.
 Han Tuo’s pain also began to quickly fade. He couldn’t help but be puzzled.
 What happened? He thought that he was doomed. Why did the other party suddenly suffer a backlash?
 Could it be that evil could not suppress good?
 Han Tuo waited uneasily.
 The mysterious existence’s screams became more and more miserable. Han Tuo’s body recovered at a speed visible to the naked eye and the stone layer quickly disappeared.
 When Han Tuo returned to normal, the mysterious existence no longer screamed. He felt something in the depths of his soul. He could easily control it like an arm.
 He took it out. Immediately after, a ball of black aura emerged from his eyes and landed on the ground, quickly condensing into a figure.
 This person had an ugly face. His facial features seemed to be pieced together. His body was enveloped by a black aura and his true appearance could not be seen.
 Han Tuo wasn’t nervous because he could completely control the figure in front of him. This feeling was extremely realistic. He could decide the other party’s life and death with a thought.
 “Who are you?” Han Tuo asked.
 The other party said fearfully, “I also want to ask who you are!”
 Han Tuo did not answer and stared at him coldly.
 The figure trembled in fear and hurriedly said, “You can call me Calamity’s Vengeful. I’m formed by countless vengeful spirits.” “Vengeful spirits? Where did you come from?” “Immeasurable Calamity…”
 Han Tuo’s eyes lit up and he asked, “Legend has it that the calamity just ended tens of thousands of years ago. What is the calamity? What kind of scene is it?”.
 The Calamity’s Vengeful said carefully, “The Immeasurable Calamity is the most terrifying calamity in the world. Most of the living beings in the previous Immeasurable Calamity died, causing the Heavenly Dao to restart. At that time, the top mighty figures almost reshuffled. Have you seen mountains and seas filled with flesh and blood everywhere? That is the Immeasurable Calamity!”
 Han Tuo was entranced. Was it really that terrifying? Han Tuo asked, “Is Li Daokong the unparalleled mighty figure of the previous Immeasurable Calamity?”
 The Calamity’s Vengeful said indignantly, “I’ve indeed heard of Li Daokong in the memories I possess. He was the eldest disciple of the Human School and he supported the Heavenly Court. However, the Heavenly Court suffered a crushing defeat. I wonder if Li Daokong survived.”
 Han Tuo couldn’t help but sigh.
 He survived.
 However, he had already been expelled by the Human School.
 Han Tuo had always been in awe of Li Daokong. After all, he was the strongest person he had ever encountered, and the other party had even saved him.
 However, Li Daokong didn’t like him. He couldn’t even acknowledge him as his master.
 Han Tuo asked curiously, “Then, who was the winner of the previous Immeasurable Calamity? I heard that there will be a winner in every calamity. They will rely on their providence to soar.”
 Calamity’s Vengeful pondered and recalled his memories. “It should be the Dark Forbidden Lord. Many memories in my mind have mentioned the Dark Forbidden Lord. It’s said that the Immeasurable Calamity was caused by the Dark Forbidden Lord. Even after the calamity ended, no one knew the true identity of the Dark Forbidden Lord, but there’s a legend in the world.
 “When the heavens fall into darkness, the Dark Forbidden Lord will descend. This day will definitely come.”
 The tone was filled with fear.
 Most of the vengeful spirits of the Immeasurable Calamity had experienced curses. That era where everyone cursed each other was crazy.
 Han Tuo continued to ask the Calamity’s Vengeful and used its memories to understand the history of the entire Immortal World.
 Han Jue retracted his gaze. The Calamity’s Vengeful was very strong and was already at the Zenith Heaven Realm. With Han Tuo’s cultivation level, it was impossible for him to suppress the Calamity’s Vengeful, but it was impossible for a Zenith Heaven to resist a Sage.
 Han Jue had his own power in Han Tuo’s body. This power didn’t surpass the perfected Pseudo-Sage Realm. Otherwise, it would be rejected by the Heavenly Dao.
 With Han Jue’s cultivation, it was too easy to control the strength.
 Han Tuo had a Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal as his bodyguard.
 However, he didn’t know Calamity’s Vengeful’s cultivation level. It was not that honest. It only said that it was stronger than Han Tuo and was proficient in soul Mystical Powers.
 “Continue cultivating. The Dark Sage King has already targeted the Immortal World. He might attack at any time. I can’t be careless.”
 Han Jue thought silently. Although the protection of the Heavenly Dao was strong, what if it was gone?
 This was not impossible!
 Safety came from himself. Han Jue would never put security in the Heavenly Dao, let alone this Heavenly Dao who wanted to scheme against him!
 Time passed.
 Three thousand years passed!
Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates This was the longest Han Jue had been in seclusion. In the past three thousand years, he hadn’t even preached the Dao or anyone came to disturb him.
 During this period of time, the situation in the Immortal World changed. Qiu Xilai ended the lecture and appointed a cultivator called Great Loose Heaven as the successor of the Sage position. This matter shocked the myriad worlds!
 Great Loose Heaven was not simple. After the Heavenly Dao restarted, he was the first mighty cultivator who established the mortal world!
 After that, the Great Loose Heaven established a providence sect in the Immortal World. It had more than ten million disciples and had the aura of the Jie School from back then.
 Apart from that, the demons were very fierce.
 Great Sage Heaven’s Equal, Yi Tian, joined the demons and became one of the ten Great Demon Saints under the Golden Crow Demon Emperor. He had countless demon soldiers under him and dominated an area.
 In contrast, the Human Race had entered the most difficult period. All the races could feed on them. After losing their status as a Heavenly Dao Race, only the Human School cared for them, but they did not support them greatly. They only occasionally helped.
 On the other side.
 The Heavenly Race became very powerful and had overwhelming power. No force in the entire Immortal World could compare to them.
 They had too many Immortal Emperors. They had few Deity Realm cultivators, but above them was a peerless mighty figure!
 The number one sword immortal of the Immortal World, Li Daokong!
 Li Daokong had joined the Heavenly Race a thousand years ago and relied on his powerful reputation to attract many mighty figures.
 Some cultivators joked that the next calamity would be a battle between the Heavenly Race and the Demon Race!
 On this day.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and stood up, stretching his waist.
 Awesome!
 Cultivating without distractions was too satisfying!
 No wonder the mighty figures of the Primordial Era entered seclusion for three thousand years at once.
 Three thousand years of seclusion had increased Han Jue’s cultivation greatly. He could feel himself becoming stronger. Han Jue checked his emails first. After confirming that nothing major had happened recently and that his friends were safe, he walked out of the Daoist temple.
 Cao Cao, Zhang Jue, and the crimson fox immediately stood up and bowed to him.
 Han Jue nodded slightly and came to the Fusang Tree.
 The disciples under the tree stood up and bowed.
 The Black Hell Chicken shouted, “It’s been a few thousand years. Master is looking better again. His cultivation level has definitely surpassed that of a Sage!”
 This flattery was a little too much.
 Han Jue was about to scold the chicken when Dao Comprehension Sword suddenly walked over.
 “Master, I was just about to look for you,” Dao Comprehension Sword said anxiously. Han Jue asked, “What is it?”
 Dao Comprehension Sword looked around and sent him a voice transmission, “Tai Sutian sent me a dream and said that the Human Race is in trouble. She hopes that the Hidden Sect can save them. She said that Nüwa will definitely not go back on her word. What you want is hidden in the Human Race.”
 Eh?
 Nüwa had hidden her Primordial Purple Qi in the Human Race?
 Han Jue didn’t really care.
 He didn’t need the Primordial Purple Qi. Besides, there were so many humans. Should he protect them all?
 In his opinion, it was fine as long as the humans of the Reroll World were alive. Even if all the humans in the Immortal World died, what did it have to do with him?
 But then again, what calamity did the Human Race face?
 Han Jue pinched his fingers to deduce and his expression became strange.
