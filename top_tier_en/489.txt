 Sage Fated Secrets had asked another Sage for help?
 Han Jue frowned. He didn’t stop and continued cursing.
 His lifespan decreased rapidly!
 25 trillion years!
 30 trillion years!
 40 trillion years!
 Han Jue couldn’t take it anymore. This was too much.
 Two Sages combined were indeed terrifying. They were like iron walls that blocked the power of curses!
 At this moment!
 (Because of your curse, your enemy Sage Fated Secrets suffered from Qi Deviation and became a Mad Sage.]
 Mad Sage!
 Han Jue immediately stopped.
 He let out a long sigh. His entire body felt comfortable as if he had finally gotten what he wanted.
 This outcome was also good. Han Jue didn’t feel that he could curse a Sage to death in one go, but Sage Fated Secrets had already become a Mad Sage. It meant that his death was not far away!
 Han Jue put down the Book of Misfortune and got up to preach the Dao to the disciples.
 13th Heaven, Heavenly Race Palace.
 Fang Liang came to visit Ji Xianshen.
 Ji Xianshen’s expression was solemn. “The 33rd Heaven is in chaos.”
 Stunned, Fang Liang asked, “What do you mean?”
 “A Sage has gone mad.”
 “What?”
 “It’s said that he went mad from the Dark Forbidden Lord’s curses.”
 Fang Liang widened his eyes. He was naturally not unfamiliar with the Dark Forbidden Lord.
 He didn’t expect that the Dark Forbidden Lord would still be alive after the Immeasurable Calamity!
 Not only that, but he also cursed a Sage!
 How impudent!
 Most importantly, the Dark Forbidden Lord had succeeded!
 Fang Liang frowned and asked, “What does this have to do with us?”
 Ji Xianshen said, “When the Sages are in chaos, their attention will shift. In addition, what do you think of the Dark Forbidden Lord? It’s said that in the previous calamity, the Dark Forbidden Lord helped the Heavenly Court.”
 Fang Liang smiled bitterly. “In the rumors, don’t you know what happened to the Heavenly Court in the end?”
 Ji Xianshen frowned. The appearance of the Dark Forbidden Lord made him feel very uneasy.
 According to his past experiences, whoever was the strongest would be targeted by the Dark Forbidden Lord. Wasn’t the current Immortal World ruled by the Heavenly Race?
 “Don’t worry. The Dark Forbidden Lord no longer appears. Even if he really wants to target us, even Sages can’t do anything. Aren’t we still waiting for death?” Fang Liang spread his hands.
 He had also become quite chill recently. He did not fight or snatch. Instead, he was relaxed.
 The current Heavenly Court immortals were already decorations. Instead, the Heavenly Race immortals were preaching and establishing faith. They were full of ambition.
 Seeing Ji Xianshen so diligent, he couldn’t help but think of his past.
 Those bound by karma were surrounded in dense fog unknowingly.
 Ji Xianshen shook his head and laughed. “Let’s not talk about this. I came to you mainly for another matter. The Human Race has appeared again. The Heavenly Court can rope them in. In the future, we can borrow the Human Race’s power.”
 Fang Liang frowned and asked, “Why would the humans appear?”
 “It’s Li Daokong. Before the calamity ended, he moved a portion of the humans away. Now that he has been released for two thousand years, the population is reproducing very quickly. If we let it be, the Ancient Race might not be able to suppress them. Taking advantage of the fact that the humans are leaderless and weak, the Heavenly Court can take advantage of them easily.”
 “Where’s Li Daokong?”
 “Him? Do you think he will become the Human Race’s leader?” Ji Xianshen said suspiciously, feeling that Fang Liang was too cautious.
 Fang Liang thought about it carefully. Li Daokong was indeed not that kind of person. He despised the humans, to begin with. The reason why he protected them was probably because of the Human School’s foundation.
 “Alright, I’ll try.”
 Fang Liang consented, but he felt inexplicably uneasy.
 After the hundred years of lecture, the Hidden Sect disciples obtained many benefits. Other than the Connate lifeforms, all the disciples and the Nether Race had already successfully stepped onto the path of cultivating the Great Dao of Extreme Origin.
 This Great Dao was much stronger than their cultivation techniques. Everyone’s cultivation speed increased greatly.
 The Connate lifeforms’ foundation was weak. They had yet to reach the point of comprehending the Great Dao of Extreme Origin.
 It was worth mentioning that Han Jue felt a force summoning him from afar.
 Great Dao of Extreme Origin!
 Could it be that when he created the Great Dao of Extreme Origin, it had also appeared in a mysterious space?
 Han Jue asked the system, but it couldn’t answer because the Great Dao itself exceeded the system’s current limit.
 This dog system had already created the Great Dao, but it had yet to reach the limits of the Great Dao?
 Han Jue had no choice but to put this matter aside.
 After returning to the Daoist temple, he focused on the world of stars.
 After more than ten thousand years, the Reroll World was no longer the same as before. It had more than ten Immortal Emperors now, and they each dominated a region of the world.
 The Reroll World was surrounded by nebulous Primordial Qi. The Immortal Emperors wanted to fly out but were directly blocked, causing the world to be completely sealed.
 The White-Robed Buddha was still the supreme existence, like a Sage of the Immortal World.
 In addition, a star not far from the Reroll World began to transform. It began to have mountains and rivers, wind and fire. It even began to produce Spirit Qi. If this continued, that star would become suitable for living beings to live on.
 Not bad! Not bad!
 Han Jue was very satisfied with the development of the world of stars. Sooner or later, it would become a Heavenly Dao.
 He shifted his gaze to the Fiendcelestial Qi. In the hundred years since the lecture, he had condensed twelve Fiendcelestial Qi again.
 The Fiendcelestial Qi was still condensing. It was unknown when it would truly condense into a Chaotic Fiendcelestial.
 Han Jue felt that he was missing something.
 Perhaps when he became a Sage, the Fiendcelestial Qi would truly undergo a qualitative change.
 After observing himself, Han Jue started cultivating.
 The Strange Deity returned to the Daoist temple and started to rub against him.
 Although its intelligence had stopped growing, its strength had been increasing. It seemed that it could constantly become stronger without cultivating.
 Han Jue guessed that it might be because he had fused with the Strange Deity that he had affected it.
ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m This was also a good thing.
 The Strange Deity was one of Han Jue’s trump cards. It could kill enemies invisible in the future.
 Before long…
 Someone asked to see Han Jue.
 The other disciples were still in the Dao Comprehension state and didn’t wake up. If this person could wake up so early, he probably had the intention to visit him.
 “Come in.”
 The door to the Daoist temple opened and Zhou Fan walked in.
 He knelt down in front of him and cupped his fists. “Master, I have a request.”
 Han Jue asked, “What is it?”
 Zhou Fan stated his intention.
 Two thousand years ago, he sensed that the Human Race had reappeared. At first, he did not care, but recently, the Human Race seemed to have seen a calamity and was summoning him.
 He wanted to help them.
 After all, he was once a human.
 Han Jue pinched his fingers to deduce. Through karma, he deduced that there were indeed humans in the Immortal World, and it was not small a number. There were already more than a million people.
 The Human Race was very far from the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 Han Jue continued to deduce.
 I see.
 The humans were being persecuted by the Ancient Race. They raised the humans as food and wanted to devour the Heavenly Dao Race’s providence. When the humans were in despair, they used a secret technique to summon experts with human bloodlines.
 Han Jue was also a human. Because of Ancient Fiendish Yin, he hated the Ancient Race.
 In that case…
 “Go,” Han Jue said calmly.
 Zhou Fan was pleasantly surprised. He hurriedly thanked him and left.
 After Zhou Fan left, Han Jue locked the Strange Deity into the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus. Then, he took out the Book of Misfortune and prepared to curse Ancient Fiendish Yin.
 It was time to settle the scores!
