 This fellow defeated the Inauspicious Divine Emperor? Han Jue thought to himself. It seemed that the situation was different from what he had imagined. Divine Lord Peacock continued to shout, “What? Are you shocked? Are you exasperated and want to curse me?”
 He had the Karma Bead that specialized in isolating curses, so he was naturally not afraid of curses. Han Jue shook his head. “If I wanted to kill you, I would have done so long ago. Besides, do you really think you escaped on your own?” Divine Lord Peacock frowned. Could it be… Divine Lord Peacock carefully recalled the previous battle. There was indeed something wrong with the Inauspicious Divine Emperor. He seemed very weak. Could it be that he had deliberately let him go? Divine Lord Peacock’s expression instantly turned ashen.
 Compared to being defeated, he hated being humiliated even more! Divine Lord Peacock glared at him. “What do you want!”
 Han Jue said, “Come back. Find a place outside the Heavenly Dao to enter seclusion. Wait for me to arrange for the disciples in the Heavenly Dao to challenge you.” Inside the Heavenly Dao? Divine Lord Peacock laughed angrily. He had some understanding of the Heavenly Dao. Even the strongest Sage was not his match. How could he not understand what Han Jue meant? He wanted to nurture that Heavenly Dao disciple again and challenge him later. If that was the case, didn’t that mean that Han Jue thought that the Heavenly Dao disciple’s potential was stronger than his?
 “Alright, I’ll rush to the Heavenly Dao now. I want to see what your Heavenly Dao disciple is capable
 of!”
 Divine Lord Peacock waved his sleeve and the dream shattered.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and looked helpless. Why was this fellow so angry?
 How did he cultivate to this day with this temper? Fortunately, he was not born in the same era as him. Otherwise, he would definitely be slapped to death.
 Han Jue still wanted to ask if the Inauspicious Divine Emperor had really been killed by Divine Lord Peacock.
 He did not believe it. No matter how he looked at it, the Inauspicious Divine Emperor was a Great Dao existence. How could he be killed by a Freedom Realm cultivator?
 If this peacock was really so capable, Han Jue wouldn’t subdue him.
 He had to think of a way to get rid of him! Han Jue didn’t allow another person with his potential to exist in the world! Especially when they were enemies! Han Jue teleported to the second Dao Field. He gathered everyone in the second Dao Field and began to preach. The Chaotic Fiendcelestials’ cultivation speed was extremely fast. They had all reached the late-stage Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm. The Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial had even reached the perfected Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm.
 It seemed that the original Chaotic Fiendcelestial cultivated the fastest.
 Yang Du was the weakest. He had no choice. He had yet to transform into a Chaotic Fiendcelestial.
 In the Milky Way, Yang Du was extremely domineering. The name of the War God resounded throughout the galaxy, but here, his attitude was humble. In front of the other Chaotic Fiendcelestials, he did not seem to exist. It was not that the Chaotic Fiendcelestials were bullying him, but the difference in cultivation level was too great. Just talking to them gave Yang Du a huge psychological pressure.
 At the same time, Yang Du looked forward to becoming a Chaotic Fiendcelestial. As for the extreme pain Murong Qi and Great Loose Heaven mentioned, he did not care at all. Han Jue left after a hundred years of lecture.
 He continued cultivating after returning to the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 When he broke through to the late stage of the Freedom Primordial Chaos Realm, he would attack Divine Lord Peacock and let him understand that there was always someone better!
 A thousand years later.
 Han Jue opened his eyes. His cultivation level had increased again, and he was getting closer and closer to breaking through. He glanced over and discovered that Divine Lord Peacock had already returned to the Calamity Race’s city outside the Heavenly Dao.
 Although this fellow was arrogant, he still kept his word.
 Han Jue said, “Come in.” In the Daoist temple, his new disciple, Guan Bubai, had been waiting for several days. Guan Bubai came to visit in a thousand years. Unfortunately, he still waited for a few days. It was not good for him to turn around and leave, so he simply waited outside. Hearing Han Jue’s words, Guan Bubai immediately entered the temple. After bowing, Guan Bubai said confidently, “Master, I’ve already become a Pseudo-Sage!” When he first became Han Jue’s disciple, he was only at the late-stage Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm. Now, he was already a Pseudo-Sage. As expected of the reincarnation of a Freedom Sage. “Not bad.” Han Jue praised. Guan Bubai said, “Master, I’ve asked around. I heard that you’re less than 200,000 years old?” When he asked this, Guan Bubai had an awkward expression.
 “Mm.”
 “Master, please impart me a great opportunity!” Guan Bubai suddenly knelt down and kowtowed. He believed that Han Jue was the reincarnation of a mighty figure, but even if he was, how could he become a Sage in two hundred thousand years? Although Fang Liang had attained the Dao, he had transmigrated to the primordial era many times. His physical body was already more than 200,000 years old, and he had relied on providence to attain the Dao. According to Guan Bubai’s understanding, Han Jue was not only a Sage. Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du had said that Han Jue was already a Freedom Realm existence!
 Guan Bubai guessed that Han Jue had a way of quickly becoming stronger, so he couldn’t help but come to greet him. He was really anxious to cultivate like this.
 Han Jue naturally guessed Guan Bubai’s thoughts, but he didn’t agree immediately.
 What a joke. You’re new here. What right do you have to receive better treatment than a personal disciple? Guan Bubai’s forehead pressed against the ground, waiting for Han Jue to agree. Han Jue suddenly said, “I indeed have a huge opportunity that can transform you. However, you haven’t done anything for me yet. How can I believe you?” Guan Bubai looked up and asked, “What do you want me to do?” Han Jue asked, “Why are you in a hurry to become stronger?” Guan Bubai gritted his teeth. “Revenge!”
 Han Jue was silent. In his previous life, Guan Bubai was attacked when he was trying to break through to the Great Dao Dao Fruit. Such hatred was irreconcilable. If it was Han Jue, he wouldn’t be able to tolerate it either.
 Guan Bubai’s favorability was five stars. In the past, Han Jue would have trusted him, but now, he felt that as long as it wasn’t maxed, it was unreliable. Han Jue hesitated. After a long while… “Forget it, I’ll send you to a place. Continue cultivating and wait,” Han Jue said and brought Guan Bubai to the second Dao Field. Guan Bubai was puzzled. What place?
 “Go out and listen to Murong Qi. As for why I brought you here, you can ask him.”
 Han Jue left after saying this. He had once instructed Murong Qi that anyone he sent here would be Chaotic Fiendcelestial candidates and he could explain everything to them.
𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m Guan Bubai immediately walked out of the Daoist temple. Murong Qi and the others immediately came over.
 There were few people in the second Dao Field, but every newcomer was a future Chaotic Fiendcelestial. They naturally had to get to know him and rope him in. In the future, they had to fight for Han Jue together.
 Sensing the terrifying blood essence of Murong Qi, the Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial, the crimson fox, and Great Loose Heaven, Guan Bubai was secretly shocked. He began to ask where this was. Murong Qi and the others did not hide anything.
 When Guan Bubai learned that Han Jue could make him a Chaotic Fiendcelestial, he was stunned.
 In his previous life, he was the Connate lifeform with the most outstanding potential. He had almost attained the Great Dao, but he knew the difference between him and the Chaotic Fiendcelestial.
 Han Jue could actually turn him into a Chaotic Fiendcelestial!
 Impossible!
 Guan Bubai’s first reaction was disbelief.
 After he entered the simulation trial with Great Loose Heaven and the Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial, he believed it and was shocked.
 A Chaotic Fiendcelestial at the Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm was enough to sweep through him! On the other side. A line of words appeared in front of Han Jue.
 (Guan Bubai’s favorability towards you has increased. Current favorability: 6 stars]
