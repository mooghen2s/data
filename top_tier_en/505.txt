 (1: Exit seclusion immediately and preach the Dao to the heavens. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment, a Heavenly Dao Spirit Stone, and a Great Dao Purple Qi.]
 [2: Cultivate in a low-profile manner and maintain your original intention. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment and a Great Dao Purple Qi.)
 This was a choice that Han Jue had triggered when he purified the Hidden Sect disciples. He didn’t have a choice before. He only returned to the Daoist temple and chose again after purifying all the disciples. Now, he was 30,044 years old.
 The reason why he did not immediately make a choice was that the Heavenly Dao Spirit Stone was too attractive.
 The Book of Misfortune would be a Heavenly Dao Supreme Treasure if it leveled up again.
 Even if he went out now, as long as he did not leave the area of the Heavenly Dao, Sages wouldn’t be able to do anything to him.
 However, after calming down, Han Jue felt that there was no need.
 The Immortal World was not a Dao Field, after all. What if the Sages had other methods?
 Han Jue adjusted his state of mind and chose the second option.
 (You chose to cultivate in a low-profile manner and obtained a Great Dao Fragment and a Great Dao Purple Qi.]
RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only [Great Dao Purple Qi: After fusing, you can obtain the right to become a Great Dao Sage.]
 Eh?
 Great Dao Sage!
 Han Jue smiled.
 This was exactly what he had guessed.
 The Primordial Purple Qi could allow one to become a Heavenly Dao Sage, while the Great Dao Purple Qi could allow one to become a Great Dao Sage.
 However, it was only a qualification, not absolute.
 Han Jue took out the Great Dao Purple Qi. It was gray and looked like a ball of smoke. He couldn’t see any effect.
 He didn’t need to fuse with it, for the time being, so he placed it into the world of stars.
 He would use it in the future.
 Han Jue could become a Sage himself now and didn’t need the Great Dao Purple Qi for the time being
 Han Jue continued cultivating and worked hard to attain the Dao.
 He was already at the perfected Pseudo-Sage Realm, but he was still far from attaining the Dao. He needed to cultivate diligently.
 The process of fusing with the Great Dao was too complicated. Even if he was talented, he had to take it slowly.
 Han Jue was already the first person in history to reach the perfected Pseudo-Sage Realm at 30,000 years old.
 In the distant past, when the world had just been created, it had taken the Dao Ancestor billions of years to reach the Zenith Heaven Realm. That was only a legend. Perhaps it had taken longer.
 Ninety years later.
 Xuan Qingjun came to the Hundred Peak Immortal River and called Han Jue’s name. When he heard that, he first spent 50 million years of his lifespan. After confirming that there was no danger, Han Jue moved her into the Daoist temple.
 There was no crying scene when the two of them met again. Instead, it was very calm.
 Xuan Qingjun smiled. “I’m back. Do you still acknowledge me as your Dao Companion?”
 Han Jue smiled. “Of course. You didn’t abandon me.”
 He had already told Xing Hongxuan about Xuan Qingjun. She didn’t find it strange. It was normal to have multiple wives in the Immortal World, and even the Human Emperor had three thousand concubines.
 Xuan Qingjun smiled even more. She raised her hand, and a purple aura appeared in her palm like a snake.
 “This is the Primordial Purple Qi. It can allow you to become a Heavenly Dao Sage. I specially brought it to give it to you.”
 Xuan Qingjun smiled proudly. This was a Supreme Treasure that made all the mighty figures go mad!
 However, Han Jue was very calm and said, “Which Sage?”
 Xuan Qingjun replied, “The Primordial Purple Qi of the Chan School. It was originally intended to be left to the Heavenly Race.”
 Not Sage Nüwa?
 Han Jue frowned. He suddenly thought of something.
 Originally, there were nine Heavenly Dao Sages. Only Nüwa, Fuxitian, the South Extreme Heavenly Venerate, Qiu Xilai, Sect Master Tian Jue, Sage Fated Secrets, Sage Jin’an, and Emperor Xiao appeared. One Sage was always a no-show.
 Could it be that the Sage had long perished?
 Han Jue asked silently.
 (3 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [They have indeed died. Currently, there are only seven Heavenly Dao Sages.] Han Jue fell into deep thought.
 There were only seven Heavenly Dao Sages, but there should be more, such as Li Muyi and Ancestor Xitian.
 Xuan Qingjun asked, “What’s wrong?”
 Han Jue smiled and said, “Are you really willing to give it to me?”
 Xuan Qingjun nodded. Her eyes were calm and sincere.
 Han Jue immediately took the Primordial Purple Qi and asked about the exact process.
 Xuan Qingjun didn’t hide anything. In the Heavenly Race, she joined the Chan School. Before Han Jue dreamed, she learned that the Chan School had the Primordial Purple Qi. Later, the Human School’s Sage, Li Muyi, sent a voice transmission to her, saying that he could help her obtain the Primordial Purple Qi.
 Xuan Qingjun was very puzzled, not understanding why she would be chosen by a Sage. Li Muyi said that there was internal strife in the Dao Sect. He chose several people, and it depended on who could do it. Then, with Li Muyi’s help, she successfully obtained the Primordial Purple Qi and fled back to the Immortal World.
 Han Jue understood after hearing this. A Sage wanted to set a trap?
 He secretly purified Xuan Qingjun and consumed another 50 million years of his lifespan.
 The two of them chatted for a while. Han Jue personally sent her out and established a Daoist temple at the side.
 After she returned, Xuan Qingjun felt that something had changed.
 After meeting Han Jue, she felt inexplicably refreshed, as if she had lost a lot of burdens.
 After returning to the Daoist temple, Han Jue began to purify the Primordial Purple Qi. He directly consumed 4 billion years of his lifespan.
 Outside the 33rd Heaven.
 At the Human School Dao Field.
 Li Muyi opened his eyes and frowned.
 “What’s going on? Why did my Sage Sense break?”
 Li Muyi pinched his fingers to deduce and his expression changed.
 “What an impressive move!”
 Li Muyi’s eyes flickered and he muttered, “Han Jue, oh Han Jue. Who are you? Who is supporting you from behind?”
 He could deduce that Han Jue was only 30,000 years old and didn’t have any background in his previous life.
 In other words, Han Jue definitely had a mysterious mighty figure supporting him.
 His gaze passed through the 33rd Heaven and landed on the Hundred Peak Immortal River. It was like a mist that even he, a Heavenly Dao Sage, could not see through.
 He had given away a Primordial Purple Qi for nothing…
 No!
 He couldn’t let this go!
 Li Mu stood up and left the Dao Field.
 …
 In the Daoist temple, Han Jue was meditating and cultivating.
 (Li Muyi’s hatred towards you has increased. Current Hatred Points: 4 stars]
 (The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate has developed hatred towards you. Current Hatred Points: 3 stars]
 (Sect Master Tian Jue has developed hatred towards you. Current Hatred Points: 3 stars]
 (Sage Jin’an has developed hatred towards you. Current Hatred Points: 1 star.]
 Han Jue opened his eyes and frowned. Why were there suddenly so many Hatred Point notifications?
 0
 m
 Could it be related to the Primordial Purple Qi?
 That should be the case!
 You came knocking on my door!
 Han Jue didn’t believe that it was a coincidence that Li Muyi found Xuan Qingjun. This Primordial Purple Qi must have been a trap. It was just that it was completely purified by the system, causing the Sages to be unable to continue plotting against him. Thus, they became angry.
 This time, Han Jue couldn’t leave the Dao Field.
 “Hatred towards me? Hate me all you want. I’ll kill you all when I attain the Dao!”
 Han Jue thought silently. He had always believed that if people didn’t offend him, he wouldn’t offend them. If people offended him, he would definitely end them!
 I’ll tolerate you for the time being!
 Han Jue adjusted his emotions and continued cultivating
 At this moment…
 “I’m Sect Master Tian Jue, the Heavenly Dao Sage. The Hidden Sect stole the Primordial Purple Qi and violated the heavenly rules. Such sins are punishable by death. All living beings, listen up. Eliminate the Hidden Sect and you can obtain Heavenly Dao Merit. You will be rewarded according to your contributions!”
