Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com Although the Ten Thousand Life Sword was strong, it couldn’t break through the essence of Dharmic powers.
 In addition, the Ten Thousand Life Sword had another fatal flaw.
 He couldn’t use it in the void.
 There was nothing in the void. He couldn’t transform nothing into a sword.
 If it was in the world, the Ten Thousand Life Sword would be more lethal than the Chaotic Body, but it was not as stable as the Chaotic Body and couldn’t be used everywhere.
 No matter what, Han Jue had grasped two Great Dao Mystical Powers. He could be considered to have completely sat on the number one throne below the Sages.
 Han Jue didn’t feel proud and continued cultivating
 The most important thing now was to reach the Pseudo-Sage Realm.
 In the blink of an eye, another seventeen years passed.
 One day.
 The Black Hell Chicken, the Chaotic Heavenly Dog, the Three-Headed Wyrm King, the Black Hell Demon Lord, Jiang Yi, Ah Da, and Xiao Er came to visit.
 Han Jue let them enter the Daoist temple.
 It wasn’t simple for so many people to look for him at once.
 Han Jue looked at them and wasn’t in a hurry to speak.
 Jiang Yi took a deep breath and said, “We want to go out!”
 Han Jue asked, “Why?”
 have broken through the seal have appeared in the world. We sense that if we devour those ferocious beasts, our potential will increase.”
 Han Jue then realized that they were all beasts themselves.
 He looked at the Black Hell Chicken.
 The chicken stood behind the crowd, trembling nervously.
 Han Jue smiled and asked, “You’re going out, too?”
 Sensing Han Jue’s gaze, the Black Hell Chicken swallowed and said, “Not really…”
 The Black Hell Demon Lord said, “Let it follow us. Nothing will happen if we act together. Otherwise, with its potential, it won’t be able to achieve anything in the future.”
 Han Jue didn’t agree immediately but fell into deep thought.
 The Three-Headed Wyrm King smiled and said, “Master, let us go. Although those beasts are strong, they’re not Jiang Yi’s match. We have already agreed to eat each ferocious beast together.”
 Han Jue asked in his mind, “If they go out to hunt ferocious beasts, will they be controlled by the Heavenly Dao?”
 (A billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [No, this is only the derivation process of the Heavenly Dao. It has awakened their instincts and is not the Immeasurable Calamity.)
 Han Jue thought for a moment and said, “Go. Be careful.”
 The demon beasts were pleasantly surprised and promised to be careful.
 Han Jue suddenly thought that this seemed to be the first time the Black Hell Chicken went out.
 He wondered if it could overcome its psychological barrier.
 That day, the demons of the Hidden Sect left. The Black Hell Demon Lord brought the other Black Hell Phoenixes along.
 Five years later.
 Han Zuitian, in other words, the Falling Heavenly Stone, successfully obtained human form.
 Just like that, a handsome youth appeared beside Zhou Mingyue. Wherever Zhou Mingyue went, he followed.
 The other disciples were very interested in this new disciple. They often came to see Han Zuitian and even taught him cultivation.
 Although Han Zuitian had acknowledged Zhou Mingyue as his master, he was being taken care of by the entire Hidden Sect.
 Tu Ling’er was always very emotional when she saw him. She thought of Long Hao.
 Back then, she had watched Long Hao grow up. Now that the calamity had ended and he had not returned, there was a high chance that he had died.
 Zhou Fan had said before that other than the Heavenly Race and the Providence Sect, almost all living beings below the Zenith Heaven Realm were dead. The True Dragon Race also suffered countless casualties. The Heavenly Emperor had long perished, so there was probably no one to protect Long Hao.
 It wasn’t only Long Hao. Su Qi and Yang Tiandong had also disappeared for a long time.
 Almost half of the second-generation disciples of the Hidden Sect had died.
 The disciples were worried that Han Zuitian would walk Long Hao’s path, so they often used Long Hao as an example to warn him.
 Fortunately, Han Zuitian had a gentle temperament and did not have any strong intentions. He didn’t have an extreme desire to cultivate and probably did not want to go out.
 After the calamity ended, Han Jue finally understood what it meant to live a long life of peace.
 The Immortal World was desolate. After returning for so long, he hadn’t seen anything attack the Hundred Peak Immortal River. The entire Hidden Sect was very calm and peaceful.
 Such a period of time might last for a long time. Chu Shiren guessed that it might take millions of years before the first batch of Connate lifeforms would appear in the Immortal World.
 It was all thanks to the Spirit Qi in the Dao Field that Han Jue could transform so quickly. However, other than here, there was no other place in the entire Immortal World that could compare to the Hundred Peak Immortal River’s Immortal Qi.
 More than ten years later.
 [Detected that you are 9,000 years old. You have the following choices:]
 (1: Enter the world and enlighten all living beings to fight for Heavenly Dao Merit. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment and a Heavenly Dao Spirit Stone.] [2: Don’t enter the world for the time being and cultivate in peace. You can obtain a Heavenly Dao Spirit Stone and a Dao Field guard.]
 Han Jue sighed.
 Unknowingly, he was already nine thousand years old.
 But why did nine thousand years sound so annoying?
 Han Jue directly chose the second option.
 He still obtained another Pseudo-Sage guard.
 Han Jue suddenly had a bold thought.
 “Can I choose to copy myself?”
 [No]
 Han Jue’s excitement was instantly extinguished. He could only obediently choose to copy Shi Dudao.
 The new guard was called…
 Sima Yi!
 At this point, Han Jue had three guards replicas of Shi Dudao: Zhao Yun, Dian Wei, and Sima Yi.
 The safety of the Dao Field increased again.
 Han Jue took out the Heavenly Dao Spirit Stone and the Book of Misfortune and started to upgrade it.
 The Book of Misfortune had contributed greatly to his achievements today. He had to improve it.
 Against a powerful enemy that far exceeded him, the effect of the Book of Misfortune was too strong
 Several days later.
 The Book of Misfortune successfully upgraded from a Zenith Heaven Numinous Treasure to a Zenith Heaven Supreme Treasure.
 In order to test the effect, Han Jue directly cursed Sage Fated Secrets with a trillion years of his lifespan.
 In the end, he didn’t see any emails from Sage Fated Secrets.
 What a waste.
 Han Jue wasn’t disappointed. He was just messing with him.
 Something would happen sooner or later!
 After cursing, Han Jue continued cultivating.
 In a hall outside the 33rd Heaven.
 Sage Fated Secrets opened his eyes and frowned.
 “Who is the Dark Forbidden Lord? The curse has strengthened again. It’s impossible for him to cultivate so quickly. He must be very strong. Previously, I only lowered my guard against him.
 “He’s definitely a Sage.”
 Sage Fated Secrets first suspected Qiu Xilai.
 Among the Heavenly Dao Sages, only they had the Dao Destruction Mystical Power. They were the greatest threat to each other, so they had no choice but to befriend each other to prevent the other from acting recklessly.
 Of course, there were also the other Heavenly Dao Sages from the three schools of the Dao Sect.
 The three schools of the Dao Sect were the orthodox lineage of the Dao Ancestor. They had always had the main say among the Heavenly Dao Sages. They often formed cliques and colluded with other Sages. Sage Fated Secrets wasn’t from the three schools and even had little to do with the Dao Ancestor. Now that he had grasped the Dao Destruction Mystical Power, he was definitely targeted.
 Sage Fated Secrets felt that he had to find out the Dark Forbidden Lord’s identity. Otherwise, it would definitely become a huge problem in the future.
 “Why don’t I also curse the other Sages and pretend to be the Dark Forbidden Lord? I’ll let them be in chaos first. This way, that fellow will easily expose himself.”
 Sage Fated Secrets thought silently.
 If he was the Dark Forbidden Lord and was instead cursed, he would definitely be worried and determined that he had been discovered. He would either restrain himself for a period of time or directly fall out with them.
 If they really fell out, Sage Fated Secrets wouldn’t be afraid of the other Heavenly Dao Sages.
 One on one, he was confident.
