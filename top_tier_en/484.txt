 Han Jue could feel that his relationship with Qiu Xilai had become quite peculiar.
 If Qiu Xilai no longer asked his disciples to join the Buddhist Sect, it meant that their relationship had been ruined. He had to be careful of Qiu Xilai’s schemes.
 There were thousands of Sages. Although he had the protection of the Dao Field, Han Jue still had to be careful.
 Although Li Muyi had left, the Connate lifeforms outside the Hundred Peak Immortal River did not leave. They seemed to recognize this place.
 Not only that, but the number of Connate lifeforms was also increasing.
 Eighty years later.
 Zhou Mingyue came to visit Han Jue, followed by Han Zuitian.
 This was also Han Zuitian’s first time coming to Han Jue’s Daoist temple.
 The master and disciple knelt in front of him, looking very nervous.
 Han Jue remained silent and waited for them to speak.
 Zhou Mingyue asked carefully, “Grandmaster, what should we do with the Connate lifeforms outside?”
 Han Jue asked, “You want to take them in?”
 Han Zuitian looked up and said, “The Hundred Peak Immortal River is so big. Since those Connate lifeforms are unwilling to leave, why don’t you accept them? I heard from the other elders that as long as Connate lifeforms survive, they will be mighty figures of the world in the future.”
 Han Jue stared at him, scaring him so much that he hurriedly lowered his head.
 Although the divine light of the Sun and Moon Yin-Yang Protection covered Han Jue’s face, the oppressive gaze made Han Zuitian feel as if he was in a cold cave.
 Han Jue suddenly realized that Han Zuitian was too ambitious.
 This ambition was inherent.
 He wondered if this was a good thing.
 Zhou Mingyue seemed to have thought of something and hurriedly said, “Grandmaster, don’t worry. I’ll only accept Zuitian. I definitely won’t lead these Connate lifeforms out to cause trouble.”
 Han Zuitian promised, “That’s right, Grandmaster. I’m only doing this for the Hidden Sect’s sake. Although the Hidden Sect is strong, most people are busy cultivating in seclusion. The sect lacks people to manage the living beings outside. I’m the youngest and can help do these things.”
 Han Jue didn’t suspect Han Zuitian’s loyalty. After so many years, his favorability towards him had already reached six stars.
 Zhou Mingyue glared at Han Zuitian and scolded him. “What are you saying!”
 Han Zuitian felt wronged and did not dare to reply.
 Zhou Mingyue was frightened. Why did these words sound so much like fighting for power?
 Although Han Jue was good to his disciples, they had never doubted his methods. If Han Jue really felt danger, he would definitely not show mercy.
 Han Jue checked the living beings near the Dao Field and didn’t find Li Muyi. He directly used his divine sense to move the hundreds of thousands of Connate lifeforms outside into the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 “Go, they’re already inside.”
 Han Jue closed his eyes after saying that.
 Zhou Mingyue and Han Zuitian were pleasantly surprised. They quickly thanked him and left.
 As soon as they entered the Hundred Peak Immortal River, the Connate lifeforms all became restless, causing the place to fall into a commotion. However, not long after, they quietened down.
 Dao Sovereign had made his move!
 Han Jue didn’t expect much from these Connate lifeforms.
 If the ten thousand Nether Race members could cultivate to the Pseudo-Sage Realm, then the existence of Connate lifeforms would not mean much.
 But there was one thing!
 Since they entered the Hundred Peak Immortal River, they could forget about leaving!
 Unless they cultivated to the Pseudo-Sage Realm!
 After thousands of years of development, and with the various providence sects preaching everywhere, more and more Connate lifeforms appeared.
 Be it Connate lifeforms or ferocious beasts, they all liked to rush towards the places with abundant Spirit Qi.
 In the Hundred Peak Immortal River, because of the Dao Field, the surrounding Spirit Qi was also constantly increasing, causing more and more Connate lifeforms to appear.
 Time passed quickly. Another thousand years passed.
 Tu Ling’er stepped into the Deity Realm. Dao Comprehension Sword, Chu Shiren, and Murong Qi also began to charge towards it.
 Zhao Xuanyuan was getting closer and closer to the Zenith Heaven Realm.
 There were already more than a thousand Connate lifeforms in the Hundred Peak Immortal River. Under Han Zuitian’s management, a form of hierarchy began to form.
 On this day.
 A large number of organized Connate lifeforms appeared outside the Hundred Peak Immortal River. They were mighty and shook the ground.
 A mighty giant appeared at the end of the horizon. In front of him, those huge Connate lifeforms were like stones. He was taller than any mountain in the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 It was the Ancient Race’s leader, Ancient Fiendish Yin!
 After so many years, the Ancient Fiendish Yin’s Ancient Race had absorbed countless Connate lifeforms and covered the various regions.
 Recently, Ancient Fiendish Yin had heard from his subordinates that there were many Connate lifeforms in this area. He had led his subordinates here and was prepared to expand the Ancient Race.
 Ancient Fiendish Yin’s gaze landed on the Hundred Peak Immortal River. The nearby Connate lifeforms seemed to be isolated by an invisible force and could not advance. Many living beings were even stuck to the edge of the formation. At first glance, half of their bodies were in the air. It was extremely strange.
DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com Ancient Fiendish Yin suddenly leaped, stirring up a terrifying wind. Some weak Connate lifeforms were directly overturned.
 Boom
 The Ancient Fiendish Yin collided with the Dao Field’s formation and was forcefully blocked.
 His long hair fluttered as if he was possessed by a ferocious beast. He began to punch the array formation with both fists, but unfortunately, he could not break through it.
 The Hidden Sect disciples walked out of their residences and looked at the terrifying figure in the sky. They looked at each other.
 Who was this?
 The Connate lifeforms in the Hundred Peak Immortal River were all frightened and nervous.
 Hao Tian came out of Long Hao’s body and said, “Ancient Fiendish Yin, I didn’t expect him to come. It’s probably because there are too many Connate lifeforms around the Hundred Peak Immortal River that attracted him.”
 His tone was filled with teasing, feeling that Ancient Fiendish Yin was courting death.
 The others did not think much of Ancient Fiendish Yin.
 Only the Connate lifeforms under Han Zuitian were nervous.
 The Ancient Fiendish Yin looked too powerful. Just looking at its figure was enough to make them despair.
 “What’s there to panic about! This person is nothing in our Hidden Sect. The mighty figure of the Hidden Sect is busy cultivating and doesn’t reveal his true body!”
 Han Zuitian cursed. Looking at his subordinates trembling, he was furious.
 They were far inferior to the Nether Race.
 That was ten thousand Immortal Emperor mighty figures! At this moment!
 Boom
 A sword Qi suddenly shot out from the Hundred Peak Immortal River. It passed through the array formation and directly pierced through the Ancient Fiendish Yin’s head. Blood splattered like rain.
 The headless Ancient Fiendish Yin hurriedly jumped away from the Dao Field.
 “How can this be!”
 Ancient Fiendish Yin was shocked. Even a perfected Pseudo-Sage could not directly penetrate his body!
 Who was the other party?
 At this moment, a figure appeared in front of him.
 The blinding divine light made him squint his eyes. He instinctively waved his palm to prevent the other party from attacking him.
 It was Han Jue.
 The Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial Dharma Idol condensed above Han Jue’s head and punched out!
 Both fists collided!
 The Ancient Fiendish Yin was directly exploded. His body turned into dust and scattered. His soul fled in fear.
 The Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial waved his fist again.
 Ancient Fiendish Yin’s soul was directly obliterated!
 Almost instantly, Han Jue disappeared and returned to the Daoist temple.
 The world fell silent.
 The Connate lifeforms outside the Hundred Peak Immortal River were all dumbfounded. They looked up in disbelief as the blood mist continued to descend.
