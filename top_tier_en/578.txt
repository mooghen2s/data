 In life, how could there be no danger or tribulation?
 Han Jue calculated. No Sage was plotting against Han Tuo behind his back.
 However, he couldn’t escape this predicament for the time being.
 Han Jue placed his gaze on the young man from the Han family who was crying. Originally, he didn’t care about him. The reason why he went to check on him was mainly that this kid looked too similar to him. Yes, similar!
 This youth looked to be sixteen or seventeen years old and was extremely handsome. Han Jue had also used a spell to look at his own face and knew his appearance. This kid was simply made from the same mold as him. He was even more like Han Jue than Han Tuo.
 Of course, compared to Han Jue, he was still inferior.
 Because of his similar looks, Han Jue liked this kid.
 What was this?
 Inherited genes? How many generations apart was he?
 In the wilderness, thunderclouds filled the sky.
 Han Yu knelt in front of his parents’ corpses. He had already cried until his throat was hoarse.
 The reason he cried was not that he was afraid, but because he was angry. He was angry that his ancestor had left him alone. He was angry that he was too weak and angry that the heavens were unfair.
 After his emotions dissipated, Han Yu looked at the corpses on the ground and fell silent.
 A red light rose in the sky like fireworks. It was the enemy’s spell signal. He had been discovered.
 Five minutes ago, he had rushed here. It was already like this. The enemy had already left. Now, he had returned to kill him.
 He wanted to eradicate the Han family!
 Han Yu was filled with anger, and his eyes became determined.
 “If this is my Han family’s fate, I will die with them!” Han Yu muttered to himself and slowly closed his eyes.
 Swish!
 A piercing sound could be heard as Han Yu’s chest was pierced by a sharp sword. Blood splattered on the corpse beside him.
 Cultivators flew over on their swords. Their auras were like a rainbow as they quickly surrounded him.
 The blue-robed man in the lead looked down at Han Yu and said, “You should be the son of the Han family, Han Yu. You’re indeed talented. Unfortunate. If you weren’t a disciple of the Han family, I could still take you in as a son-in-law. You must die today. The grudge between our families should end here.”
 Clang
 The blue-robed man pulled out a soft sword from his sleeve. The blade quickly burned with flames, illuminating the dark world that seemed like night.
 Han Yu grabbed the sword with his bare hand and pulled it out.
 Boom!
 The black clouds churned even more violently as thunder rumbled. “He still wants to resist?”
 “Tsk tsk, the Han family has always claimed that they have an Immortal God ancestor. They are inferior to our Wang family’s ancestor. At the very least, our Wang family’s ancestor appeared and taught our disciples Dao techniques.”
 “The Han family deserved what happened to them today. When they were strong back then, they also wiped us out.”
 “Hurry up and kill him!”
 “What are you afraid of? Can anyone save him now?”
 The cultivators discussed. Some urged, some cursed, and some mocked.
 The blue-robed man waved his sword down. The blade transformed into firebirds that were dozens of feet wide. They swooped down at Han Yu as if they wanted to burn all the corpses in the area.
 Han Yu looked calmly at the firebirds that filled the sky. He had already accepted the outcome of the Han family being wiped out.
 Under his gaze, the dozens of firebirds suddenly dissipated. The thunderclouds in the sky parted and wisps of sunlight shone on Han Yu.
 In an instant, Han Yu felt as if a lifetime had passed.
 “Hmph, who said that the Han family’s ancestor is inferior to your Wang family’s ancestor?”
 A cold snort sounded. The Wang Family cultivators felt as if they were struck by lightning. Their entire bodies trembled, their eyes losing color. Han Yu’s pupils slowly widened. Under his gaze, the Wang Family cultivators turned to dust.
 Han Jue attacked.
 Killing these mortals involved only a thought.
 However, he still showed mercy and let their souls fall into the cycle of reincarnation without dissipating.
 Han Jue had already attained the Dao. Only existences stronger than him could make him worry.
 He wouldn’t feel guilty about killing some mortals.
 Han Yu came back to his senses and asked excitedly, “Is it Ancestor Han Tuo?”
 Ancestor appeared!
 Han Jue’s voice sounded, “Han Tuo? I’m tens of thousands of years older than him.” He didn’t directly reveal his identity. If Han Tuo knew, he would think that he was an ancestor.
 In Han Tuo’s understanding, Han Jue should have parents. There must be other Han family members above.
 Han Yu was stunned.
 In the family tree, Han Tuo was the father of the creator and was already the ancestor with the highest seniority.
 Unexpectedly…
 Many years later, Han Yu mentioned this experience to his descendants with a sigh.
 That day, he asked his ancestor for help. The ancestor did not reply, but the ancestor’s ancestor came to the rescue.
 Inside the Daoist temple.
 Han Jue ignored Han Yu’s question. It was already good enough that he could save him. He wouldn’t do anything for him anymore.
 Unless Han Yu displayed a temperament that satisfied him, Han Jue’s good impression of him would only stop at his physical appearance.
 He continued to cultivate.
 A day in the Immortal World and a year in the mortal world did not mean a difference in time, but life experiences.
 To cultivators, a year was nothing. To mortals, a year was enough to change their lives. In the blink of an eye.
 A thousand years passed.
 After Han Jue’s cultivation ended, his cultivation improved again. Although it was not obvious, he could only break through after many years. He first observed Han Tuo. This kid had already rushed out of the Nine Nether Purgatory and returned to the Immortal World. His cultivation had increased greatly and was already very close to the Deity Realm.
 He looked at Han Yu again and discovered that he was actually not dead yet. He was already a Mahayana cultivator now.
 Although Han Yu was still alive, the Han family was already gone.
 Han Yu didn’t create a new family. Instead, he cultivated diligently. Not to mention having children, he didn’t even have a Dao Companion.
 This kid was very sensible.
 Han Jue only took a look. Since the two of them were not in danger, he couldn’t be bothered to interfere.
 Han Jue started to check his emails.
Diisscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com Soon, an email attracted his attention.
 (Your good friend Qiu Xilai was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure and was severely injured.)
 Why was Qiu Xilai severely injured?
 He looked up and saw that Qiu Xilai was still in his Dao Field.
 All these years, Han Jue didn’t feel any battle fluctuations. What happened?
 Who attacked Qiu Xilai?
 Han Jue had no choice but to use the derivation function.
 (Ten billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?] Continue!
 Immediately after, a figure appeared in Han Jue’s mind. (Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du: Perfected Heavenly Dao Sage, eldest disciple of the Human School, Immeasurable Emperor, Ancestor of the Human Race)
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du!
 Could it be the Great Daoist Master Xuan Du in the Investiture of the Gods?
 Han Jue had already caught a powerful aura in Li Muyi’s Dao Field. It was not weaker than Heavenly Venerate Wufa, but it was not much stronger.
 Why did Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du attack Qiu Xilai?
 Han Jue didn’t continue to use the derivation function but visited Qiu Xilai in his dreams.
 The reason why he checked just now was to understand the other party’s cultivation.
 In the dream.
 Qiu Xilai opened his eyes and saw that it was Han Jue. He hurriedly stood up and bowed.
 Han Jue asked, “Why did Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du attack you?”
 Stunned, Qiu Xilai sighed. “You’re really remarkable. You even know this. It’s not an attack. It’s just a spar. He used a special Mystical Power to spar with me and didn’t disturb the Heavenly Dao.”
