 Because Han Jue had changed the Heavenly Dao’s calamity several times, he raised his favorable impression of him…
 Eh?
 Has my identity as the Dark Forbidden Lord been exposed?
 Han Jue panicked.
 The Dao Field could block the prying of the Heavenly Dao-level divine sense. Ancestor Xitian seemed to be above the Heavenly Dao…
 Han Jue secretly asked, “Ancestor Xitian guessed that I’m the Dark Forbidden Lord?”
 (100 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 A hundred billion years?
 Han Jue was shocked.
 Ordinary Heavenly Dao Sages were only worth three or four billion years. The difference was a little too great.
 Continue!
 Han Jue gritted his teeth and chose. A line of words appeared in front of him.
 [Ancestor Xitian does not care about the various worlds of the Heavenly Dao. He doesn’t know about the existence of the Dark Forbidden Lord.)
Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief.
 In that case, Ancestor Xitian had only captured the changes in the Heavenly Dao’s calamity.
 Fortunately, Ancestor Xitian had a favorable impression of him.
 Thinking about it carefully, the endings of the calamities that Han Jue had changed were all tragic. They were all about to destroy the world. He never thought of benefiting himself.
 Han Jue felt no pressure after thinking it through
 A Transcendent Dao Expert like Ancestor Xitian should not interfere in the matters of the Heavenly Dao. Otherwise, those extremely evil and sinful people would have long died. “What kind of existence is a Transcendent Dao Expert?”
 Han Jue couldn’t imagine what the world in Ancestor Xitian’s eyes was like. Then, he continued cultivating. 900 billion years of lifespan had not caused any problems for Sage Fated Secrets. To put it bluntly, it was because his cultivation level was too weak and the Book of Misfortune was not strong enough.
 Time flew.
 The battle in the Immortal World became more and more intense. Corpses were everywhere and blood flowed like rivers.
 It looked like the war between the humans and the Heavenly Court, but behind it was countless races, sects, providence sects, and the Sacred Dynasties.
 A God of Misfortune had recently appeared in the Heavenly Court. Wherever he passed, misfortune would overflow. The Heavenly Tribulation would be vast and the mental demons would be chaotic. Every time he appeared, he would cause a large number of casualties. After his deeds spread, it caused all living beings to panic.
 It was Su Qi.
 Because of him, Heavenly Court obtained successive victories, causing the humans to feel uneasy.
 The Human Race’s Sage, Fuxitian, was stopped by a mysterious Sage. He had been fighting in the void and had yet to return. Under such circumstances, the Human Race needed a hero to stand out.
 Finally, as expected, a hero stood up.
 Zhou Fan!
 Zhou Fan wasn’t afraid of Su Qi’s bad luck. He was the only existence who could fight him openly. The two of them were on par.
 With the experts restraining Su Qi, the pressure on the battlefront decreased greatly. Just like that, fifty years passed.
 Han Jue was extremely close to breaking through to the late-stage Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm. He would be able to welcome the opportunity to break through in at most ten years.
 On this day, Dao Sovereign summoned him to the Chaotic Domain.
 Han Jue went to receive him. Dao Sovereign expressed that he came to fulfill his promise and was willing to join him.
 Just in case, Han Jue still spent 100 million years to derive it. He was only relieved after confirming that there was no mysterious mastermind behind Dao Sovereign.
 Dao Sovereign’s talent was still very powerful. It could even be said to be the number one under the Heavenly Dao.
 Han Jue said, “If you join me, you can forget about coming out anymore. You have to cultivate in seclusion with me.”
 Dao Sovereign said calmly, “I understand.”
 “I have to consider what identity I should arrange for you. Do you want to be my disciple?”
 “What? You’re humiliating me?”
 Dao Sovereign was furious. He had always treated Han Jue as a brother, but he wanted to be his master?
 This was too much!
 Han Jue smiled and said, “Do you want to
 spar?”
 Dao Sovereign snorted. “Of course!”
 “Come over first. I’ll teach you a Mystical Power. Summon me and I’ll bring you to my Dao Field.”
 “Mm.”
 A month later.

 Han Jue felt that Dao Sovereign was using the Invocation Technique. He also calculated cautiously and confirmed that there was no danger before going.
 Arriving in front of Dao Sovereign, Han Jue brought him away without waiting for him to speak.
 After returning to the Connate Cave Abode, Dao Sovereign’s gaze landed on him.
 He was stunned.
 What a handsome man!
 Dao Sovereign didn’t look bad, either. It seemed that all the geniuses had good looks. With a high cultivation level, it was extremely easy to change their appearance. However, it was almost impossible to achieve Han Jue’s effect. After all, the aesthetic taste of all living beings was different.
 Dao Sovereign raised his eyebrows and asked, “Shall we fight?”
 Han Jue smiled and said, “Alright, I have a Mystical Power that can’t affect reality.”
 He directly pulled Dao Sovereign into the simulation trial, and the two fought.
 There was no suspense.
 Han Jue directly used the Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial Dharma Idol to kill Dao Sovereign.
 Dao Sovereign was not convinced. He thought that it was an illusion.
 Therefore, Han Jue fought with him again and let him use his full strength first. After he used his full strength, he killed him with a punch.
 Dao Sovereign was depressed.
 After returning to reality, Han Jue smiled and asked, “Are you going to be my disciple?”
 Dao Sovereign fell silent.
 After a while, he asked, “Where’s Zhao Xuanyuan? He’s already your disciple?”
 “Mm.”
 “No way. If I become your disciple now, wouldn’t I be his junior?”
 “Everything has to be done in order. If he becomes your senior brother, he can take care of you. Besides, if you become his junior, it will stimulate his cultivation. It’s a win-win situation.”
 Han Jue rejected calmly.
 Dao Sovereign frowned. It sounded reasonable, but it was ridiculous no matter how he thought about it.
 Can I stand this embarrassment?
 Han Jue continued, “If you’re obsessed with your status, it means that you are superficial and not pure enough. Isn’t cultivation the most important? Could it be that your ego is greater than your heart of cultivation?”
 Dao Sovereign gritted his teeth.
 He realized that Han Jue was really mean. “From today onwards, you are my seventh disciple. Go out and get to know the others. Cultivate under the tree. You can enter the previous combat Mystical Power at any time and train your combat strength.” Han Jue sat on the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus and closed his eyes. Dao Sovereign nodded. Then, he noticed the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus. His pupils constricted.
 This was…
 Heavenly Dao Supreme Treasure!
 The legendary 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus!
 Why was it here?
 A storm brewed in Dao Sovereign’s heart. He didn’t ask and turned to leave the Connate Cave Abode.
 Soon, Han Jue heard Zhao Xuanyuan’s exclamation. He was clearly pleasantly surprised.
 It was worth mentioning that Dao Sovereign was already at the Five Mystic Divine Origin Realm.
 Among Han Jue’s disciples, his cultivation level was the highest. Each successive disciple had higher cultivation.
 This was quite strange.
 The addition of Dao Sovereign caused another commotion in the Hidden Sect.
 Jiang Yi didn’t dare to be arrogant anymore.
 Li Yao also felt immense pressure.
 The Black Hell Chicken also began to cultivate seriously.
 Everyone could feel the pressure. The Hidden Sect was rapidly becoming stronger!
 There might be even more experts joining in the future. How could they dare to relax?
 Chu Shiren joked that the greatest winner of this calamity was the Hidden Sect.
 Zhao Xuanyuan said proudly, “With me and Brother Dao around, the Hidden Sect will definitely be a colossus in the Immortal World in the future. All of you have to work hard and not be a burden.”
 These words were very annoying, but they were also the truth.
 The Black Hell Chicken said unhappily, “Don’t be arrogant. Jiang Yi, Chu Shiren, you have to work hard to catch up to them!”
 Jiang Yi snorted. “Of course. You guys are the number one faction in your respective factions, so am I! However, who is the number one prodigy of the Hidden Sect? It’s still unknown!”
