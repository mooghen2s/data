 This was not good!
 “Can the Sages of the Chiliocosm World enter the Dao Field through the spatial vortex?” Han Jue secretly asked.

 Continue!
 How annoying!
 [Not for the time being. The Dao Field is located in the Heavenly Dao. Sages need to cross the control of the Heavenly Dao to enter it.]
 Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief.
 It wasn’t a good thing to continue like this.
 He had to eliminate the threat.
 Han Jue suddenly thought of Su Qi. Absolute Purification allowed Su Qi to perfectly control bad luck. Could he let the Fusang Tree control the space-time vortex? He directly purified the Fusang Tree.
 (A billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 Han Jue couldn’t be bothered to ask. Since asking required hundreds of millions of years of lifespan, he might as well do it directly.
 The Fusang Tree began to shake as if a person was itchy and twisting about.
 Han Jue said, “Don’t worry. I’m helping you.”
 The Fusang Tree asked curiously, “Help me with what?”
 “I’ll help you control the spatial vortex. This place is too dangerous. If it’s really difficult to control, I can only…”
 Han Jue didn’t say anything else. The Fusang Tree was almost frightened to death.
 Ma Chao, Dian Wei, and Zhao Yun did not speak.
 The guards could communicate, but they only followed Han Jue’s orders and didn’t think about anything else.
 Han Jue stayed on the Fusang Tree and waited for the Absolute Purification to end.
 After a while.
 The Absolute Purification was over.
 The spatial vortex shrank.
 The Fusang Tree said in surprise, “I can actually control this space-time vortex. It’s like my branch. I can control it to sprout and bloom.”

 Not only could it eliminate the negative debuff, but it could also buff!
 Han Jue said, “Without my instructions, you are not allowed to open the space-time vortex in the future.”
 The Fusang Tree replied, “Alright!”
 To prevent any accidents, Han Jue still left Dian Wei here. The other guards guarded the various areas of the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 Han Jue returned to the Daoist temple and continued cultivating.
 After so many years, he was still far from the mid-stage of the Pseudo-Sage Realm. Fortunately, his improvement was very obvious.
 Ever since they obtained the Great Dao of Extreme Origin, Zhou Fan, Li Yao, Dao Sovereign, Zhao Xuanyuan, and Jiang Yi began to enter seclusion. Everyone could feel their aura becoming stronger. The other disciples were all curious about what special treatment Han Jue had given them.
 Han Jue had a goal. He wanted the entire Hidden Sect to cultivate the Great Dao of Extreme Origin.
 As he cultivated the Great Dao deeper, the disciples of the Hidden Sect could not betray him.
 If he died, it would harm all the cultivators of the Great Dao of Extreme Origin.
 Of course, the stronger he was, the greater the benefits for cultivators of the Great Dao of Extreme Origin.
 Han Jue wanted to spread his own Dao.
 Five hundred years passed in a flash.
 More and more ferocious beasts surrounded the Hundred Peak Immortal River. They weren’t attracted here, but simply because the number of ferocious beasts in the world increased.
 Many ferocious beasts were also growing in the Hundred Peak Immortal River. Because it was isolated from the Heavenly Dao, it was not affected by its providence. They didn’t transform into ferocious beasts but Connate lifeforms like Han Zuitian.
 These Connate lifeforms’ potential was far inferior to Han Zuitian’s. Without the notification of triggering the providence bearer detection, Han Jue ignored them.
 However, Han Zuitian was very interested in them. Before they had even transformed, he had already called them brothers and took them in as his underlings.
 Han Jue didn’t care about this.
 As the person with the lowest seniority in the Hidden Sect, it wouldn’t be bad if Han Zuitian could recruit those Connate lifeforms.
 On this day.
 The Hundred Peak Immortal River welcomed a guest.
 “I’m Fang Huangjun of the Heavenly Race. I have specially come to visit the Sect Master of the Hidden Sect.”
 A voice entered the Dao Field.
 Han Jue opened his eyes.
 Wasn’t Fang Huangjun the current leader of the Fang Clan created by Fang Liang?
 Han Jue wasn’t surprised that the Dao Field was exposed.
 The Heavenly Race was the greatest force now. It wasn’t difficult for them to travel the Immortal World without many living beings.
 Han Jue asked, “What is it?”
 Fang Huangjun’s voice sounded again, “The Heavenly Race is preparing to hold a banquet in the 13th Heaven and invite all the forces in the world. Our leader specifically instructed that the Hidden Sect should also be a major force and asked me to personally invite them.”
 Banquet?
 Han Jue thought for a moment and said, “I better not go. Thank you for your leader’s kind intentions.”
 Fang Huangjun continued, “The leader said that you don’t have to worry. At that time, the Heavenly Court and the Heavenly Race will take care of the Hidden Sect. If you don’t want to come, you can send your disciples. This banquet will be divided into various regions of the Immortal World. The Hidden Sect doesn’t want to be in the territory of other major factions in the future, right? At that time, there will be endless trouble. How are you going to cultivate?”.
 Han Jue remained silent.
 That was true.
 He didn’t want to have conflicts with the other major factions.
 “Is Fang Huangjun saying Ji Xianshen’s true feelings?” Han Jue asked in his mind.
 [A billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?] Continue!
 [Fang Huangjun isn’t lying.)
 Han Jue asked, “When?”
 “In fifty years. We will hold the banquet for ten years.”
 “Alright!”
 “Then, I’ll take my leave.”
 “Goodbye.”
 After Fang Huangjun left, Han Jue called Murong Qi, Dao Sovereign, and Jiang Yi over.
 “In the banquet of the Heavenly Race in fifty years, the three of you can go together and lead a hundred Nether Race members. Murong Qi will take charge, and the others will listen to his arrangements.” Han Jue instructed.
 Although Murong Qi’s seniority was low, he was the most stable and had once controlled his own faction.
 Dao Sovereign smiled. “No problem.”
 Jiang Yi raised his eyebrows and said, “Aren’t a hundred Immortal Emperors too few? If we want to stay away from trouble, we have to show our strength and bring another nine hundred Immortal Emperors.”
 Ten thousand Immortal Emperors. This was an extremely terrifying force.
 The Divine Palace and the Heavenly Court at their peak had not reached this level, so Jiang Yi really did not care about the other factions.
 Han Jue said, “It’s not good to be too strong. Let’s just add another hundred. No more. You can discuss it with Han You.”
 Jiang Yi curled his lips and said, “Alright.”
 Han Jue thought for a moment and added, “Don’t provoke any enemies. But if anyone causes trouble for you, there’s no need to hold back.”
 Being too timid was not good sometimes.
 The three of them nodded and agreed. Then, Han Jue asked them to leave.
 Han Jue sighed silently. “The Connate lifeforms have yet to rise, but the various forces can’t wait to divide their territory. The Connate lifeforms of this generation are really pitiful.”
 His target was no longer the Immortal World. His opponent was not a Pseudo-Sage, but the Sages from all directions.
 It was best to become a Sage as soon as possible.
 Now, even if the Hidden Sect encountered trouble, they could resolve it themselves.
 Speaking of which, the Hidden Sect still lacked a prominent figure.
 Although Murong Qi was calm, his potential was lacking.
 Among Zhao Xuanyuan, Dao Sovereign, and Jiang Yi, he had to quickly support a powerful existence. At the very least, it had to be a Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal.
 Currently, Dao Sovereign would be the first to reach the Zenith Heaven Realm. It was just that this fellow was too reckless and found it difficult to carry out important missions.
 In the future, if anything happened to the Hidden Sect, they couldn’t always rely on Han Jue.
 Look at the three schools of the Dao Sect. Their sect masters were all disciples. Sages were high and mighty.
 Han Jue closed his eyes as he thought.
 At the same time, the Hidden Sect disciples gathered in the Myriad Worlds Hall to discuss the Heavenly Race Banquet.
 They were all very excited. This indicated that the Hidden Sect had truly become a major force in the Immortal World.
