 Another thousand years passed.
 Han Jue meditated on the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus and started to check his emails.
 [Your good friend Yang Du received guidance from a mysterious Sage. His cultivation has increased greatly.)
 [Your good friend Evil Heavenly Emperor was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure and was severely injured.)
 [Your grand-disciple Fang Liang has successfully fused with the Heavenly Dao power and grasped it.]
 (Your son Han Tuo has entered the Dark Forbidden Zone.)
 [Your good friend Shi Dudao was cursed by a mysterious curse.)
 [Your good friend Ancestor Xitian was cursed by a mysterious curse.]
 [Your good friend Heavenly Venerate Wufa was ‘cursed by a mysterious curse.]
 Han Jue frowned.
 Why did Han Tuo leave the Immortal World? Han Jue pinched his fingers to deduce and sighed. The reason why this kid left the Immortal World was to save Yi Tian.
 He didn’t even want his life anymore.
 Han Jue wasn’t easy to judge. Everyone had someone they valued the most.
 If Han Tuo was caught by a Great Dao Sage, it was impossible for Han Jue to save him.
 Han Jue had already instructed that if Han Tuo still dared to go out, he had to be responsible for his actions.
 He continued to read the emails and discovered that recently, all the Sages had been cursed by a mysterious curse, except him.
 “Why am I not being cursed?” Han Jue asked in his mind.
 [The Dao Field can isolate the curse karma.] Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief. So that was the case. The Dao Field was really stable.
 “I want to know, who’s cursing the Sages?” Han Jue continued to ask in his mind.
 (160 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?) Continue!
 Immediately after, many faces appeared in his mind.
 (Cundi: Great Dao Sage, Immeasurable Emperor, founder of the Buddhist Sect. Because you severed his karma with Qiu Xilai, he has developed hatred towards you. Current Hatred Points: 5 stars]
 [Emperor Xiao: Mid-stage Primordial Chaos Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal, Heavenly Dao Sage, disciple of the Dao Ancestor, one of the Ancestors of the Devil Race. Current favorability: 3 stars]
 [Karma Heaven: Great Dao Divine Spirit, formed by the Great Dao of Karma. Later, it was controlled by Ancestor Xitian and was deprived of the Great Dao Origin. Therefore, it hates the Heavenly Dao. Because you stopped its plans to destroy the Heavenly Dao, it has developed hatred towards you. Current Hatred Points: 4 stars]
 [Undying Dao: Transcendent Dao Expert, Immeasurable Emperor, one of the first living, beings after the splitting of the heavens. Because he was expelled by the Heavenly Dao in the Immeasurable Calamity, he views the Heavenly Dao as his enemy. He heard that you stopped the Heavenly Dao from being destroyed and developed hatred towards you. Current Hatred Points: 2 stars]
 Han Jue was speechless. He didn’t expect there to be four people pretending to be him. They were all existences comparable to the Great Dao.
 This was also a good thing. It meant that these mighty figures were not completely united.
 Han Jue looked at Li Daokong.
 He was about to succeed in attaining the Dao. His body had already become a Sage. His soul was only a step away from completely transforming.
 Han Jue was a little excited. Li Daokong was the first Sage he had nurtured!
 Seventy-six years later.
 A vast heavenly might enveloped the myriad worlds!
 “I am Li Daokong of the Hidden Sect. Today, I have used my strength to attain the Dao and obtained the Dao Fruit of a Sage. I will protect the disciples of the Hidden Sect and control the sect’s order. I will fulfill my duty as a guardian!”
 Everyone was in an uproar!
 Another person had successfully attained the Dao!
 All living beings were not unfamiliar with Li Daokong because he had always been at the top of the Heavenly Dao Providence Board. However, they didn’t expect Sages to be born one after another.
 The strangest thing was that in the past, Sages would make great promises and swear to the Heavenly Dao. Li Daokong actually swore to the Hidden Sect…
 The Hidden Sect surfaced again.
 The various forces in the Immortal World were shocked.
 That day, Li Daokong came to the 33rd Heaven and opened the Dao Field.
 The other Sages rushed over to congratulate him. Shi Dudao’s expression was very ugly because Li Daokong had always been pestering him. He had finally become a Sage, but he didn’t expect Li Daokong to catch up again.
 Indeed, the first thing Li Daokong said when he saw Shi Dudao was, “Hmph, there’s still no clear winner between us. We’ll continue in the future!”
 Shi Dudao was silent and did not answer.
 The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate sighed. “Two Sages have already appeared in the Hidden Sect. Disciple-Nephew Daokong, you have to shoulder the responsibility of protecting the Heavenly Dao in the future.”
 Li Daokong was no stranger to the South Extreme Heavenly Venerate, Sect Master Tian Jue, Emperor Xiao, and Qiu Xilai.
 Li Muyi’s eldest disciple’s talent had once made them extremely envious. Until today, they still felt that Li Daokong’s potential was top-notch.
 Li Daokong said, “Of course. I’ll usually imitate the Sect Master and cultivate in peace. You don’t have to worry that I’ll act recklessly.”
 The Sages nodded and heaved a sigh of relief.
 They were afraid that since Li Daokong had just attained the Dao, he would want to be bold, towards the Heavenly Dao. Fortunately, he was like Han Jue, an ascetic.
 Although the Hidden Sect had infiltrated the various major factions, it did not control the Heavenly Dao. This was also one of the reasons why the Sages did not scheme against the Hidden Sect.
 Of course, the most important reason was that they couldn’t win.
 “There’s only one seat left. The nine Sages will gather and the providence of the Heavenly Dao will be perfected. Only then can we cultivate in peace,” Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said.
 Shi Dudao asked in surprise, “Aren’t there already nine?”
𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com South Extreme Heavenly Venerate, Qiu Xilai, Sect Master Tian Jue, Emperor Xiao, Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du, Heavenly Venerate Wufa, Shi Dudao, Li Daokong, and the Sect Master of the Hidden Sect!
 There were exactly nine of them!
 Sect Master Tian Jue shook his head. “Fellow Daoist Han is not a Heavenly Dao Sage. Although he lives in the Heavenly Dao, he’s not restricted by the Heavenly Dao’s providence.”
 They had also found this strange.
 How did Han Jue do it?
 He attained the Dao in the Heavenly Dao but was not restricted by it.
 Shi Dudao was silent. He was now even more curious about the Sect Master of the Hidden Sect.
 Han Jue had contacted him as the Dark Forbidden Lord, so he didn’t know the Hidden Sect Master.
 “In addition, the Dark Forbidden Lord has recently targeted us. If you are cursed and can’t hold on, you must seek our help. The current Heavenly Dao can’t withstand the replacement of a Sage,” Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du reminded.
 Dark Forbidden Lord…
 Shi Dudao’s eyes flickered. He thought to himself, Sorry, I might have to take the Dark Forbidden Lord’s side.
 Although his Primordial Purple Qi was not given to him by the Dark Forbidden Lord, the Sage who had given him the Primordial Purple Qi was probably not doing it out of good intentions.
 Compared to the hypocritical Sage, he liked the Dark Forbidden Lord more.
 The Sages chatted for a while more before going their own ways.
 Three hundred years later.
 “I am the Heavenly Emperor of the Heavenly Court and the creator of the Heavenly Dao Sect, Fang Liang. Today, I will attain the Dao and nurture the Sage’s Dao Fruit. I will set up the order of the Heavenly Dao and distinguish between good and evil. I will lead all living beings to the right path!”
 Fang Liang’s voice suddenly resounded through the myriad worlds and shocked all living beings again. Another Sage was born!
 The Sages were shocked. They didn’t expect Fang Liang to become the last Heavenly Dao Sage!
 Immortal World, Loose Heaven Sect.
 Inside a palace.
 A black-robed man suddenly opened his eyes in disbelief.
 “How is that possible! Shouldn’t it be me?”
 He was Great Loose Heaven!
 The Sages had promised to help him become a Sage. He had always thought that he was stable. To become a Sage, he had to have the Primordial Purple Qi. Since the Sages wanted to give him the last Primordial Purple Qi, he would definitely become a Sage.
 In the end…
 Great Loose Heaven’s first reaction was that they had fooled him.
 No!
 He had to seek justice!
 Great Loose Heaven immediately moved towards the 33rd Heaven.
 At this moment, the Sages were gathered in the Universal Hall. Other than Li Daokong and Shi Dudao, the Sages of the older generation had all arrived.
 “What’s going on? How did Fang Liang attain the Dao?” The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate asked in a low voice.
 Things became strange.
 A Primordial Purple Qi appeared in front of them!
