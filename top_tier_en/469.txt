 Han Jue couldn’t help but feel relieved when he saw this email.
 This meant that his curse had worked.
 Sage Fated Secrets hated his identity as the Dark Forbidden Lord, not him. He naturally did not panic.
 Moreover, as long as he stayed in the Dao Field, the Heavenly Dao Sage couldn’t barge in.
 Han Jue stopped thinking and continued cultivating
 Time passed quickly after the Heavenly Dao restarted.
 In a flash.
 Eight hundred years passed.
 In the mortal world, eight hundred years was already enough to change the dynasty.
 Han Jue was finally about to break through to the Pseudo-Sage Realm. The negative karma that he had accumulated for several calamities was still endless. It was enough for Han Jue to continue cultivating.
 Breaking through to the Pseudo-Sage realm took longer than any other breakthrough.
 After twenty years, Han Jue finally stepped into the Pseudo-Sage Realm.
 Because of the Dao Field concealing the heavenly secrets, Han Jue did not need to transcend the tribulation. However, the powerful aura he emitted couldn’t be suppressed even by the system barrier. Everyone in the Dao Field could sense it.
 The system barrier could only conceal the internal scene and couldn’t prevent the aura from leaking out. After all, Han Jue was no longer a mortal.
 Although his aura was strong, it could not pass through the Dao Field’s defensive array.
 “Master broke through again?” “What a powerful aura. This is definitely not something that a Zenith Heaven cultivator can achieve.”
 “He still says that he’s not a Sage.” “I don’t think he’s breaking through, I think he’s creating a Mystical Power.”
 “Indeed. Sect Master’s Mystical Powers are all extremely exquisite and unheard of. It means that he has been comprehending Mystical Powers while cultivating.”
 Everyone from the Hidden Sect sighed at Han Jue’s breakthrough.
 This was a good thing. The stronger Han Jue was, the safer they would be. At the same time, their cultivation would also be elevated.
 Inside the Daoist temple.
 Han Jue checked his attributes list as he consolidated his cultivation.
 (Name: Han Jue]
 [Race: Primordial Fiendcelestial (Immeasurable Emperor)]
 [Cultivation: Early-stage of the Pseudo Primordial Chaos Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm]
 (Technique: Primordial Chaos Reincarnation Great Dao, Heavenly Cycle Body Tempering]
 [Great Dao: Great Dao of Life and Death, Great Dao of Karma, Great Dao of Extreme Origin]
 Pseudo Primordial Chaos Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal!
 The Primordial Chaos Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm should be the Sage Realm.
 What a mouthful.
 Han Jue noticed that his lifespan had increased by ten times!
 1.2 sextillion years!
 Who else can match me!
 After consolidating his cultivation, Han Jue had to curse Sage Fated Secrets.
 It was worth mentioning that Han Jue didn’t receive any system notifications when he broke through to the Pseudo-Sage Realm.
 Could it be that the system did not acknowledge this realm?
 Han Jue felt a little regretful and focused on cultivating
 He used ten years to consolidate his cultivation. Then, he took out the Book of Misfortune and started cursing Sage Fated Secrets.
 This time, he wanted to see how many years his limit was.
 Five days later.
 Han Jue’s lifespan began to decrease. He stared at his attributes panel.
 A hundred million years!
 A billion years!
 Ten billion years!
 A hundred billion years!
 His lifespan decreased faster and faster!
 Outside the 33rd Heaven, Sage Fated Secrets was gathered in a stone pavilion with the South Extreme Heavenly Venerate, Sect Master Tian Jue, and Sage Jin’an. Clouds surrounded them, and the light was dim.
 As they chatted, Sect Master Tian Jue asked, “Fellow Daoist Fated Secrets, why are you suddenly silent?”
 Sage Fated Secrets took a deep breath and said, “The Dark Forbidden Lord is cursing me.”
 Dark Forbidden Lord?!
 The three Sages frowned.
 The Sages had discussed before and discovered that the calamity had progressed too quickly. It was mainly because the Dark Forbidden Lord had cursed the various factions in the Immortal World and even caused a curse trend, causing the Sages to have no choice but to personally participate in order to set up their own arrangements.
 They had even joined forces to investigate, but they couldn’t find out the Dark Forbidden Lord’s true identity.
 Now that the Fated Secrets Sage was being cursed by the Dark Forbidden Lord, this was not good. This meant that the Dark Forbidden Lord wanted to target the Sages.
 At the thought that Sage Fated Secrets might be cursed to death by the unknown Dark Forbidden Lord, the Sages couldn’t help but feel desolate.
 They couldn’t let this happen!
 If the Sages were cursed to death in a peaceful era, where would their dignity be?
 “Do you really think that the Dark Forbidden Lord is a Heavenly Dao Sage?” Sect Master Tian Jue frowned and asked.
 Sage Fated Secrets asked, “Other than Sages, do mortals have such methods? As for higher existences, they don’t care about the Heavenly Dao.”
 Hearing this, the three Sages fell into deep thought. Sages had fought openly and secretly for countless years. They couldn’t trust each other.
 Sage Fated Secrets was observing the three Sages’ reactions. They didn’t know what he was thinking
 The three Sages actually had doubts. Could Sage Fated Secrets be pretending? Could he be acting?
 “To be honest, I’ve been cursed recently,” Sage Jin’an suddenly said with a worried expression.
 Sage Fated Secrets glanced at him and asked, “Really?”
 Sage Jin’an said, “Yes. Like you, we’re cursed once every ten years. However, we are not cursed at the same time.”
 The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate said, “In that case, the Dark Forbidden Lord is not one of us, but another Sage. Although the three schools of the Dao Sect know how to fight, they never use their true strength. After all, we are bound together for good or bad.”
 Sect Master Tian Jue nodded.
 Sage Fated Secrets cursed silently and said, “In that case, I hope that the three of you can find out the Dark Forbidden Lord’s true identity.”
 “Alright!” the three Sages replied in unison.
 Three trillion years!
 Han Jue was constantly refreshing his record, but the Heavenly Dao Sage was really stubborn. Nothing happened no matter how long he cursed.
 Han Jue wanted to test his limits. How many years of lifespan could he lose before the negative state appeared?
 His lifespan continued to decrease.
 After ten trillion years, Han Jue’s heart began to tremble.
 Crap, he was already a Pseudo-Sage. Could he continue cursing endlessly?
 Should I persist a little longer?
 Han Jue gritted his teeth.
 After deducting 15 trillion years of his lifespan, Han Jue finally saw an email.
 (Because of your curse, your enemy Sage Fated Secrets has a disrupted Sage Heart and developed mental demons.)
 Han Jue immediately stopped.
Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com His heart was still bleeding.
 It took him 15 trillion years to barely produce a mental demon.
 Was this the Heavenly Dao Sage?
 Han Jue put away the Book of Misfortune and decided not to act recklessly in the future.
 This was too extravagant.
 Sage Fated Secrets was definitely not the last enemy. There would be stronger enemies in the future, but it was only a matter of time before they appeared. What would happen if he kept squandering his lifespan?
 Han Jue’s breakthrough speed had already slowed down. This meant that he couldn’t quickly refresh his lifespan anymore.
 He had to stabilize himself in the future.
 While Han Jue reflected on himself, Sage Fated Secrets panicked.
 He found Qiu Xilai, and the two of them met in a golden palace.
 “What? The Dark Forbidden Lord can curse you until you developed a mental demon?” Qiu Xilai was shocked.
 Compared to him, Sage Fated Secrets was stronger.
 If what Sage Fated Secrets said was true, the Dark Forbidden Lord would also be a threat to him.
 Sage Fated Secrets’s expression was extremely ugly. “If I lie, the Heavenly Dao’s providence will be damaged!”
 Qiu Xilai looked even more flustered.
 The Dark Forbidden Lord was definitely a Sage. He might even be stronger than Sage Fated Secrets!
 Who was it?
