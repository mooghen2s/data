 After landing, Great Loose Heaven fell into a daze. He suddenly woke up and hurriedly knelt down. “Thank you for your kindness, Sect Master! Great Loose Heaven will forever be loyal to you!” Great Loose Heaven said excitedly. With his six-star favorability towards him, Han Jue believed that he was speaking from the bottom of his heart. Han Jue smiled. “Go out. Cultivate here in the future and listen to Murong Qi.” “Alright!” Great Loose Heaven did not say anything else. After bowing, he walked out of the Daoist temple.
 Murong Qi and the others sensed his aura and immediately walked over. Learning that Great Loose Heaven had also transformed into a Chaotic Fiendcelestial, they congratulated him. After knowing that Great Loose Heaven was a terrifying existence at the perfected Pseudo-Sage Realm, Yang Du became even more nervous.
 At the same time, he looked forward to his future even more.
 Everyone here was a Chaotic Fiendcelestial. He would be the next!
 Great Loose Heaven knew that there were actually other Chaotic Fiendcelestials. He was even more shocked, but he hid it in his heart. What was the Sect Master trying to do? Cultivate a Chaotic Fiendcelestial Army?
 There were already four Chaotic Fiendcelestials. There would be more in the future! Great Loose Heaven thought of the scene of a group of Chaotic Fiendcelestials coming out of seclusion and sweeping through the chaos in the future. His blood boiled and his fighting spirit soared.
 Han Jue didn’t leave the second Dao Field immediately. He began to observe Ren Gang and Yin Hongchen. The two of them were already Grand Unity True Immortals. Ever since Yang Du, they had become top Reincarnators in the Reincarnation Space. Han Jue didn’t ask Immortal Emperor Samsara to take care of them. They could reach this point because of their own efforts.
 It was worth mentioning that there were some conflicts between the two of them. They had fought before and there was no outcome.
 After entering the Reincarnation Space, the two of them soared into the sky. They were even stronger than Yang Du back then.
 Apart from their own potential that was higher than Yang Du’s, it was all thanks to the Reincarnation Space that had already occupied the Earth Immortal World and enjoyed its providence. The speed at which the Reincarnators became stronger was several times faster than before. Han Jue thought for a moment and decided to visit them in their dreams and preach the Dao to them. He directly pulled the two of them into the same dream. Without waiting for their reaction, the Great Dao of Extreme Origin drowned their consciousness.
 At the edge of the galaxy, there was a planet shining with countless lights. Thousands of space stations circled around it. There were as many flying transports as there were locusts. On the planet, a majestic building was surrounded by clouds. At the highest level, a woman sat on the shiny glass floor. The walls were filled with technological light and were dazzling. She wore a tight black cultivation robe that accentuated her figure perfectly.
 She was Yin Hongchen.
 She suddenly opened her eyes. Her eyes were confused and her body trembled slightly. After a long time. She calmed down and muttered, “Was that a dream?
 “No, my cultivation level has actually increased by quite a bit… It must be the work of that mysterious senior who taught me my cultivation back then…”
 Yin Hongchen’s eyes lit up. She was already a top-notch Reincarnator. She had tried all sorts of rewards in the Reincarnation Space and had never experienced such an experience.
 Yin Hongchen couldn’t help but be curious about that senior. Who was he?
 Why was he nurturing her? Unable to figure it out, Yin Hongchen began to recall what she comprehended. “Extreme… Origin…” On the other side, on a meteor. A burly man with a naked upper body sat in a huge pit. His black hair fluttered slightly and his aura was wild. He was the other Fiendcelestial candidate Han Jue had chosen, Ren Gang. Ren Gang slowly opened his eyes. He was also shocked by the Great Dao of Extreme Origin. “Who are you… “Am I not an orphan?” Ren Gang’s expression became complicated. This unparalleled expert who ruled the Milky Way began to worry.
 After returning to the Hundred Peak Immortal River, Han Jue didn’t continue cultivating. Instead, he preached the Dao to the disciples. Under the attack of the Hidden Punishment Lineage, the disciples who went out and didn’t return had been captured. The disciples who didn’t return were all dead.
 This time, Guan Bubai was immersed in the lecture.
 A hundred years passed quickly. (Guan Bubai has a favorable impression of you. Current favorability: 5 stars] After becoming his disciple, he didn’t have a good impression of Han Jue. This time, he directly reached five stars.
 Indeed, he had to show his strength! Han Jue smiled. He was looking forward to being undefeated. He could sense that Guan Bubai had already stepped into the Great Dao of Extreme Origin. His comprehension speed was faster than all the other disciples. The prodigies from the Chaos were indeed different.
 He planned to nurture Guan Bubai until he was invincible. He wasn’t afraid of him betraying the sect after that. After all, there was the Primordial Heavenly Prison! Han Jue already wanted to arrange a Chaotic Fiendcelestial position for Guan Bubai. “Sages, come to the Universal Hall immediately!”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du’s voice suddenly entered Han Jue’s ears, his tone revealing a hint of anxiety. Surprised, Han Jue immediately looked at the netherworld. Indeed!
 A large amount of aura approached from the Dark Forbidden Zone outside the netherworld as if it wanted to drown it. Eh?
Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m Inauspicious Evil? No, although it was invisible, the aura was strong and not as mysterious as the Inauspicious Evil. Han Jue frowned. He immediately headed to the Universal Hall. In the Universal Hall, the Sages gathered and discussed the mysterious aura outside the netherworld.
 Han Jue didn’t interrupt. When Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du suddenly appeared, the Sages turned to look at him.
 The impatient South Extreme Heavenly Venerate was the first to ask, “Who is it this time?” Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du sighed. “The Calamity Race is the strongest race in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End. This time, they have the backing of Fuxitian and the Heavenly Lord of Primordial Beginning. As expected, Fuxitian is not dead. His backing is Nüwa. Nüwa is the first generation Sage and has long been a Great Dao Sage. She was an important pawn left behind by the first generation Sages to supervise the next Heavenly Dao Sages. After the Dao Ancestor disappeared, the situation of the calamity changed drastically. That was why she escaped. “Fuxitian is a Sage supported by Nüwa. They’re actually siblings. Fuxitian and Nüwa are united. This calamity is equivalent to a showdown.” The Sages frowned. They were not surprised that Nüwa was still alive. After all, they had guessed so before.
 Fang Liang asked, “How’s the Calamity Race compared to the Flame Race?”
 Shi Dudao snorted. “They must be stronger. Otherwise, would they be sent here just to die?” Li Daokong smiled disdainfully. “That’s right!” The Sages looked at them in surprise. Why were these two Sages suddenly on the same side?
 Fang Liang, Shi Dudao, and Li Daokong were all new Sages. They weren’t polite to each other and did not need to be polite. Looking at his three pawns, Han Jue didn’t say anything
