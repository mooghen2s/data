 Xing Hongxuan blinked. Thinking back carefully, Han Jue seemed to have never left the sect alone. Even if he came to the Immortal World, he would bring them along. Instead, they had all left the Hidden Sect alone.
 Thinking of this, Xing Hongxuan asked curiously, “Aren’t you tired of staying in the sect?”
 Han Jue asked, “Why?” “No one should be your match now. Don’t you want to go out and take a look?”
 “Have you been possessed by the Heavenly Dao?”
Diisscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com Han Jue looked at her warily. He hesitated, asking himself if he should purify her.
 Xing Hongxuan said helplessly, “You’re too cautious. You’re already a Sage, but you’re still afraid of going out.”
 When she met Han Jue for the first time, he was still a youth. At that time, he was very cautious. Now that he was a Sage, he was still so cautious.
 Perhaps this was the reason why he could become a Sage.
 The two of them continued chatting about the past and the present.
 Several months later.
 Han Jue left Xing Hongxuan’s Daoist temple and came to the Fusang Tree.
 The disciples stood up and bowed to him.
 After tens of thousands of years, even after moving to the Hundred Peak Immortal River, the Fusang Tree was still where the personal disciples gathered.
 The Black Hell Chicken flew over and shouted, “Master, I want to complain!”
 Han Jue asked, “What?”
 The Black Hell Chicken shouted, “Ah Da and Xiao Er want to go out!”
 Ah Da and Xiao Er were Golden Crows. Back then, because their potential was not good, they were expelled from the family. Now, they were already Deity Realm existences, but they were still a distance away from the Zenith Heaven Realm.
 Ah Da hurriedly said, “No, it’s talking nonsense. It’s just that a Golden Crow is using the bloodline resonance to summon us!”
 Xiao Er trembled in anger as the True Sun Flame on his body burned.
 Han Jue counted with his fingers. It turned out that the Golden Crow Demon Emperor was summoning the Golden Crows of the myriad worlds. The Jie School’s attacks were very fierce. If this continued, the demons would definitely disband. The demons might not be wiped out, but as a member of the Demon Race’s royalty, the Golden Crow Divine Clan could not survive.
 Han Jue said, “After reaching the Pseudo-Sage Realm, you can go out whenever you want. Before that, don’t even think about it or fan the flames.”
 With that, he walked in front of the Fusang Tree and began to observe it.
 There were already more than three hundred spatial vortexes connected to the tree. Han Jue didn’t expect there to be so many worlds outside the Heavenly Dao. Fortunately, these worlds were far inferior to the Immortal World.
 After so many years, the Fusang Tree’s cultivation had already reached the Six Mystic Divine Origin and could step into the Zenith Heaven Realm at any time.
 Han Jue asked the Fusang Tree to open those spatial vortexes, and he started to spy on the world inside.
 The other disciples did not dare to disturb him and cultivated separately.
 Buzhou Divine Mountain.
 A three-legged Golden Crow with a wingspan of a million feet sped over from the west, wanting to go up the mountain.
 Boom
 A surging sword Qi erupted, scattering the sea of clouds and shaking the Buzhou Divine Mountain.
 The three-legged Golden Crow had no choice but to stop and say, “I’m the Golden Crow Demon Emperor of the Demon Race. I have come to visit Senior Li Daokong!”
 “No.”
 Li Daokong’s voice was extremely cold and firm.
 The living beings on the Buzhou Divine Mountain were all very nervous. They had long heard of the Golden Crow Demon Emperor. Although Li Daokong was ranked first on the Heavenly Dao Providence Board, the Golden Crow Demon Emperor was not bad either. He also had demons under him.
 “This matter involves the Buzhou Divine Mountain!” the Golden Crow Demon Emperor said in a low voice. He didn’t expect Li Daokong to not give him face.
 “Get lost!”
 Li Daokong’s voice was like thunder, deafening all the living beings on the Buzhou Divine Mountain.
 “Hmph!”
 The Golden Crow Demon Emperor snorted coldly and left.
 A hundred years later.
 The demons rushed towards the Buzhou Divine Mountain from all directions. Demonic aura filled the air and formed dark clouds that enveloped the Buzhou Divine Mountain as if a calamity was coming.
 Far away in the Hundred Peak Immortal River, Han Jue suddenly opened his eyes.
 He frowned slightly and looked over.
 Countless demons surged from all directions at the Buzhou Divine Mountain. They were like an ocean that wanted to drown it.
 The strongest among these demons was only at the Immortal Emperor Realm.
 The demons wanted to attack the Buzhou Divine Mountain?
 However, these demons were so weak…
 Wait!
 Han Jue’s expression darkened.
 I see!
 The demons had used more than a hundred million demon soldiers to climb the Buzhou Divine Mountain. They wanted to anger Li Daokong. If he took action and killed these cannon fodder, the immense negative karma would negate his Heavenly Dao providence. At that time, he would not be able to protect his position at the top of the Heavenly Dao Providence Board.
 Han Jue pinched his fingers to deduce. He couldn’t guess which Sage was supporting the demons.
 In his opinion, a Sage was definitely supporting them. Otherwise, if the demons were expelled by the Jie School, how could they have the guts to make enemies again?
 “I want to know who is supporting the Golden Crow Demon Emperor.” Han Jue thought. (160 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 So many!
 Han Jue’s heart sank.
 He immediately chose to continue. Then, he entered an illusion.
 When he opened his eyes again, Han Jue came to a crimson hall covered in flames. He saw the Golden Crow Demon Emperor kneeling in front of a figure.
 Dijun!
 Dijun looked down at the Golden Crow Demon Emperor and said indifferently, “I already know the situation of the demons.”
 The Golden Crow Demon Emperor gritted his teeth and said, “Ancestor, please save the Golden Crow Divine Clan!”
 Dijun said, “I’m not your ancestor. The Golden Crow Divine Clan’s Dijun is only one of my Dharma Idols. I have long transcended karma and am not within the illusion.”
 “But…”
 “The Golden Crow Divine Clan have no Sages. It’s very difficult for you to gain a foothold in the Immortal World. You can only rise again and again. You will be wiped out time and time again. You will struggle at death’s door and reincarnate endlessly.”
 The Golden Crow Demon Emperor was silent.
 Dijun continued, “However, I have a way to help the Golden Crow Divine Clan transcend fate. If I succeed, the Golden Crow Divine Clan will produce a Sage. If I fail, the Golden Crow Divine Clan will be wiped out. You are not allowed to expose my existence. Do you dare?”
 The Golden Crow Demon Emperor suddenly raised his head and said, “I dare! The Golden Crow Divine Clan has no way out!”
 “Let the demons rush to the Buzhou Divine Mountain and force Li Daokong to take action to reduce the Heavenly Dao’s providence. I will give you a Heavenly Dao Supreme Treasure. You can go to the Dark Forbidden Zone to retrieve it. I will guide you.”
 “Alright!”
 The Golden Crow Demon Emperor was extremely excited. The words “Heavenly Dao Supreme Treasure” made him dizzy.
 The illusion ended.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and frowned.
 Dijun was also targeting the Heavenly Dao, and he even gave the Golden Crow Demon Emperor a Heavenly Dao Supreme Treasure.
 Something was wrong.
 Didn’t these mighty figures already transcend the Heavenly Dao and even the Great Dao? Why were they still attacking the Heavenly Dao?
 Han Jue continued to deduce the reason.
 [It involves the karma of an existence that surpasses the limits of the system. It cannot be deduced.]
 Eh? Han Jue raised his eyebrows. Dijun was not that strong.
 In his understanding, only the Dao Ancestor surpassed the system’s limits.
 Could it be that the reason why Dijun attacked was because of the Dao Ancestor?
 Han Jue couldn’t figure it out. He sent a voice transmission to Li Daokong and asked him not to attack the demons. He should directly use an array formation to encircle the Buzhou Divine Mountain.
 The Jie School was chasing after the demons. As long as the demons did not go to the Buzhou Divine Mountain, they would collapse soon.
 Li Daokong immediately cast a spell. Sword light rose from the edge of the Buzhou Divine Mountain like swords of light floating in the air. The tips of the swords faced the sky, looking magnificent.
