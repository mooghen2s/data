 The cycle of reincarnation began and the demons were about to rise again.
 After the Devil Race, it was indeed the Magus Race. Before the Heavenly Dao restarted, the demons were also ranked behind the Devil Race. It wasn’t such a coincidence. It was definitely fate.
 Although there was war, the development of the Immortal World was indeed becoming better and better. The cultivation trend spread throughout the myriad worlds. Other than the Ancient Race, the Demon Race, and the Heavenly Race, many other races rose, looking like hundreds of flowers blooming.
 Not only that, but Han Jue also observed that the Immortal World was actually becoming larger!
 The boundary was constantly expanding towards the Dark Forbidden Zone. The land quickly expanded. It was extremely magical.
 Han Jue looked carefully and discovered that a Sage’s aura was everywhere in the Immortal World. So, it was done by a Sage.
 It wasn’t difficult for him to recall the reason. The Heavenly Devil Calamity had almost destroyed all living beings in the Immortal World, making the Sages realize how weak all living beings were.
 Han Jue watched for a while before continuing to cultivate.
 Jade Bodhi and Seven Dao Sage brought him pressure. He could relax occasionally, but the main focus of his life had to be cultivation.
 Even if his talent was unparalleled, it would take a long time for him to be on par with the Great Dao.
 For example, how many calamities had Dijun passed?
 Unimaginable!
 Immeasurable!
 Han Jue’s current target was the Freedom Sage Realm!
 Although he was only at the mid-stage, he had to have ambitions!
 Two hundred and thirty years later.
 Han Jue, who was cultivating, was interrupted by Li Yao who came to visit him.
 Han Jue let her in.
 Li Yao came in front of him and bowed. “Sect Master, after stepping into the Zenith Heaven Realm, my cultivation level has increased very slowly. I keep feeling that something is missing.”
 Han Jue said, “You lack actual experience?”
 Li Yao’s personality was the same as his. After coming to the Hidden Sect, she did not go out again. What was different from him was that Li Yao did not have a system.
 Zenith Heaven was already the limit of living beings. Without opportunities, it was very difficult to improve.
 As for Pseudo-Sages, which one of them was not a peerless genius and unparalleled expert who stunned an era?
 Li Yao frowned. “I don’t want to go out. How can the greatest opportunity in the world compare to following you?”
 Han Jue asked, “Then, what do you think is missing?”
Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates Li Yao took a deep breath and said, “I’ve experienced training before I joined the Hidden Sect. I’ve experienced countless slaughters along the way in the Immortal World. In my life, I might be lacking a companion.”
 Companion?
 Han Jue showed a frown.
 He understood the implied meaning.
 Han Jue sized her up. It had to be said that in terms of looks, Li Yao was among the top among the women he had seen. Her temperament also made him admire her.
 Li Yao had never had a clear identity in the Hidden Sect. She wasn’t Han Jue’s disciple, but her status was equivalent to a second-generation disciple.
 Han Jue fell silent.
 Li Yao mustered her courage and stared at him.
 She had been suppressing these words for a long time.
 Ever since Han Jue saved her and guided her to the Hidden Sect, feelings had long been buried.
 After a long while…
 Li Yao stood up and walked towards him.
 Under the Fusang Tree.
 The Black Hell Chicken looked at Han Jue’s Daoist temple and muttered, “Why do I feel that woman wants to eat chicken?” Tu Ling’er opened her eyes in anger. Crap!
 Too late!
 However, she didn’t have the guts. After all, she was already Han Jue’s disciple. The status of master and disciple was like a huge mountain that made her not dare to cross the line.
 Dao Comprehension Sword asked curiously, “Chicken? She wants to eat you?”
 The Black Hell Chicken rolled its eyes at her and said, “You don’t understand, silly grass. All you know is to cultivate. You should have been close, but unfortunately, you’re too stupid.”
 Its tone was disappointed. Dao Comprehension Sword stood up and drew her sword.
 The Chaotic Heavenly Dog came to mediate, but it only added fuel to the fire.
 For a time, the Fusang Tree was in chaos. It had been a long time since it was so lively.
 Seven years later.
 In the Daoist temple, Li Yao sat beside Han Jue. Her clothes were clean, but her face was slightly red.
 Han Jue said softly, “Not bad. If your Dharmic powers fuse, you should be able to make a breakthrough.”
 Li Yao nodded. “Thank you, Sect Master. Your Dharmic powers have guided me greatly. It’s better than ten thousand years of bitter cultivation.”
 Han Jue shook his head. “It’s not that exaggerated.”
 “Mm.”
 The two of them fell silent again.
 Li Yao stood up and bowed before leaving.
 Han Jue suddenly stopped her and said, “From now on, you’re my Dao Companion. You’re the same as Xing Hongxuan and Xuan Qingjun. Remember, Xing Hongxuan is the first, don’t cause trouble internally.”
 Li Yao’s brows lifted, and she immediately agreed happily.
 Several days later.
 Xing Hongxuan came to visit. She didn’t say anything and only pestered him for a year before leaving.
 Han Jue couldn’t help but look at the other women. Xuan Qingjun, Fairy Xi Xuan, and Chang Yue’er were still cultivating.
 The three women usually kept a low profile. It was mainly because their potential was poor and they could only spend time.
 Perhaps because of the difference in cultivation, they were a little restrained when facing Han Jue. He couldn’t force them to do anything and let nature take its course.
 Han Jue didn’t have much desire for women. He was already a Sage and didn’t have to lower himself.
 Of course, the other disciples were all very smart. They didn’t dare to act recklessly in front of the three women.
 “Actually, it’s not ridiculous to fuse Yin and Yang occasionally.”
 Han Jue thought silently and continued cultivating
 In the next hundred years, Li Yao broke through to the mid-stage Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm and entered the top three again in the hundred-year competition. This performance shocked the other disciples. They didn’t know what Han Jue had taught her.
 However, the threshold to become Han Jue’s Dao Companion was too high. Just the gender was enough to make the other disciples give up.
 In the blink of an eye, six hundred years passed.
 More and more Immortal Emperors appeared in the Hundred Peak Immortal River. All members of the Nether Race had stepped into the Deity Realm and were still far from the Zenith Heaven Realm. However, ten thousand Deity Realm cultivators were enough to overturn all the forces in the world.
 On this day.
 Li Daokong returned, and Han Jue moved him into the Daoist temple.
 All these years, Li Daokong had sparred with Shi Dudao from time to time. There were no longer any emails about him being severely injured.
 “Sect Master, I encountered the Heavenly Race’s Patriarch, Ji Xianshen. He’s in danger and hopes that the Hidden Sect can help. He’s not the only one. Fang Liang is also trapped,” Li Daokong said.
 Han Jue asked, “Trapped by who?”
 “Great Loose Heaven. This person created the first mortal world and has more than a thousand Grand Unity Golden Immortals under him. He’s also at the late-stage Pseudo-Sage Realm and has powerful Mystical Powers,” Li Daokong replied.
 Hesitating for a moment, he added, “The Chan School is behind him. The Sages have expressed their goodwill to you. I don’t know if Ji Xianshen and Fang Liang are disciples of the Hidden Sect now, so I didn’t attack.”
 Han Jue wasn’t dissatisfied. Instead, he was very satisfied.
 Li Daokong wasn’t as rash as he had expected. He had thought it through.
 Han Jue said, “Go find Han You and lead 1,000 Nether Zenith cultivators to save Ji Xianshen and Fang Liang. Send them safely to the heavens.”
 It was time to fight for the Heavenly Dao’s providence!
 In the Immortal World, Han Jue didn’t have to do it personally.
 Li Daokong was secretly shocked. Such a huge move?
 He asked cautiously, “That Sage?”
 “Don’t mind him.”
 “Understood.”
 Li Daokong immediately made arrangements.
 An hour later, Han Jue moved Li Daokong and 1,000 Nether Zeniths out of the Dao Field.
 He then closed his eyes and resumed cultivating. He wasn’t worried that the Sages of the Chan School would have any objections.
 Strength was the only thing that mattered!
