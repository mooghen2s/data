 Ji Xianshen pinched his fingers to deduce with a strange expression.
 On the other side.
 In the Hundred Peak Immortal River, Han Jue also opened his eyes.
 It had been a hundred and seven years since Heavenly Venerate Wufa left. During this period of time, he had been cultivating until he was disturbed by this mysterious aura.
 “What a familiar aura…” Han Jue muttered to himself and pinched his fingers to deduce.
 He deduced that a golden light was connecting the world in the west of the Immortal World. This golden light shot out from an island volcano into the sky. It was unstoppable. From afar, it was like a miracle. At the bottom of the golden light, a figure squatted in the magma. From the figure, it could be seen that it was a youth.
 Rank One Immortal Emperor!
 Han Jue narrowed his eyes.
 He had just been born and he was already an Immortal Emperor?
 Amazing!
 Han Jue discovered that he couldn’t figure out this golden-haired youth’s background.
 He had to use the derivation function to deduce.
 (5 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Eh?
 Five billion years?
 This was even more impressive than a Heavenly Dao Sage!
 Han Jue was interested and chose to continue.
 (Tian: Rank One Immortal Emperor, Son of the Heavenly Dao, Chaotic Fiendcelestial, the great providence bearer chosen by the Heavenly Dao. He carries the mission of unifying the Immortal World.]
 Son of the Heavenly Dao!
Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m Chaotic Fiendcelestial!
 So powerful?
 Han Jue was interested.
 He noticed that many cultivators were flying towards the island where the sky was being pierced by the golden light. There was even Emperor Xiao’s clone, Emperor Chen.
 Han Jue thought for a moment and sent a voice transmission to Li Daokong, who was on his way back.
 He asked him to investigate Tian. It depended on Li Daokong’s mood if he wanted to take in a disciple.
 As for Han You, he continued to return with the thousand Nether Zeniths.
 Han Jue thought for a moment and sent a voice transmission to the Three Pure Sacred Ancestor to find Tian.
 He didn’t tell Li Daokong about the Three Pure Sacred Ancestor joining them. The two of them did their own thing and relied on their own abilities.
 Li Muyi had yet to discover anything unusual with the Three Pure Sacred Ancestor. After returning, he hadn’t even gone to find him.
 According to the Three Pure Sacred Ancestor, Li Muyi completely used him as a Dharma treasure and would not ask about him usually.
 Han Jue was a Sage now, the master of a major force. He couldn’t do everything himself.
 Then, he closed his eyes and continued cultivating.
 So what if he was the Son of the Heavenly Dao?
 If you become my enemy, you will still be destroyed!
 In the endless sea, islands dotted the surface. Cultivators flew from all directions towards the same island.
 It was the island where the Son of the Heavenly Dao was born. The mysterious golden light had already dissipated.
 On the island, at the mouth of the volcano.
 A naked youth crawled out. He was slightly thin, had white hair, eyes like snakes, and a pair of horns that looked like sharp blades on his forehead.
 The youth looked around in confusion.
 “Born as an Immortal Emperor. Not bad, not
 bad.”
 A gentle laugh sounded. The youth turned around and saw Emperor Chen standing by the cliff, smiling at him.
 The youth was vigilant. Although he didn’t know how to speak, he instinctively resisted when facing unfamiliar things.
 At this moment, mighty cultivators landed on the mountain peak. “What race is this?”
 “Amazing. I can even see his golden light on the fifth level. His potential is definitely not simple.”
 “Even a Pseudo-Sage is here. Looks like this kid is not someone we can take in.”
 “Who doesn’t have a powerful background? My senior brother’s father’s Uncle-Master is also an Immortal God of the Heavenly Race. Did I brag about that?”
 “Let’s wait and see. There seems to be something wrong with this kid.”
 The cultivators discussed.
 Being surrounded like this, the white-haired youth was extremely nervous. His gaze swept around as if looking for a gap to escape.
 At this moment, golden lotuses scattered down from the sky. It was a spectacular and beautiful sight.
 “This child is fated with me. Everyone, disperse.”
 The Three Pure Sacred Ancestor’s voice sounded. It was majestic and shook the world.
 Everyone turned around and saw the Three Pure Sacred Ancestor walking down the clouds. There seemed to be an invisible staircase beneath his feet.
 Many cultivators were moved when they saw him.
 Although they didn’t know who the Three Pure Sacred Ancestor was, his powerful and unfathomable aura was enough to them.
 “This child is fated with our Buddhist Sect. Please give us face!”
 “Divine Might Buddha!” someone exclaimed in reverence.
 The leader of the Buddhist Sect was a top mighty figure who had experienced the calamity. 90% of the living beings in the world had to call him ancestor!
 The Divine Might Buddha and the Three Pure Sacred Ancestor were about to confront each other!
 The atmosphere became tense.
 Outside the 33rd Heaven.
 At the Buddhist Sect Dao Field.
 Qiu Xilai’s expression darkened. It was unknown what he was thinking.
 A figure floated in front of him. It was the Spirit of the Heavenly Dao.
 “You said that you wanted to support me, but now, you’ve created the Son of the Heavenly Dao. What do you mean by this?” Qiu Xilai asked in a low voice.
 Seeing Tian appear, he almost died of anger.
 Even a Sage couldn’t withstand it.
 The Heavenly Dao Spirit said, “I can’t do anything, either. This Chaotic Fiendcelestial was left behind by the Dao Ancestor when he left. The Heavenly Devil Calamity caused the Heavenly Dao’s providence to decline. This Chaotic Fiendcelestial has awakened. I have no choice but to transform it into a Son of the Heavenly Dao. Only then can I control it.”
 Qiu Xilai frowned, still unhappy.
 The Heavenly Dao hid too many things from him. He suddenly felt that he was a pawn.
 A Son of the Heavenly Dao came out now, what about next time?
 When could he control the Heavenly Dao and become a figure like the Dao Ancestor?
 The Heavenly Dao Spirit said, “Recently, the Hidden Sect’s providence has increased very quickly. The Heavenly Race’s providence is all focused on the Heavenly Ancestor, and the Heavenly Ancestor has karma with Han Jue. He must have already joined the Hidden Sect. You have to be careful.”
 Qiu Xilai said calmly, “I understand, but Han Jue is too strong. We can’t fight him openly.”
 The Heavenly Dao Spirit vanished.
 Qiu Xilai waved his right hand, and a screen of light appeared in front of him.
 In the screen of light, the Three Pure Sacred Ancestor was fighting dozens of mighty figures, including Li Daokong and the Divine Might Buddha.
 Even if he was alone, the Three Pure Sacred Ancestor still had the upper hand. He was extremely powerful.
 Qiu Xi was envious.
 If he had the Three Pure Sacred Ancestor, wouldn’t he have the final say in the Immortal World?
 Ten years later.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and pinched his fingers to deduce.
 His expression became strange.
 That Son of the Heavenly Dao did not follow anyone. Instead, he dominated an island alone and became a king. Li Daokong actually pestered the Three Pure Sacred Ancestor and kept chasing after him.
 The Three Pure Sacred Ancestor knew that he was from the Hidden Sect and had been going easy on him. With Han Jue’s orders, he couldn’t tell the truth and could only fight with Li Daokong.
 Han Jue was speechless.
 He knew Li Daokong, but he didn’t expect him to be so stubborn.
 He had no choice but to send him a voice transmission asking for him to give up.
 “It’s fine, Sect Master. I have to defeat him!” Li Daokong replied in his mind. Han Jue rolled his eyes in anger.
 Forget it.
 He would let this fellow fight. In any case, it was impossible for him to defeat the Three Pure Sacred Ancestor.
 Although Li Daokong was strong, he had yet to surpass Shi Dudao.
 Han Jue was about to close his eyes and continue cultivating when he sensed Dao Sovereign approaching.
 In the current Hidden Sect, other than Han Jue, Li Daokong, and the guards, Dao Sovereign was the strongest disciple. His cultivation had already reached the mid-stage of the Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm and was very close to the late stage.
 “Master, there’s another newcomer in the Chaotic Domain. Aren’t you going to take a look?” Dao Sovereign asked after entering the temple.
