 Li Daokong was excited.
 “So, the Ten Thousand Life Sword is so strong… This is definitely the strongest Sword Dao Mystical Power, but I didn’t study it thoroughly,” he muttered to himself with an excited expression.
 Immediately, it was not only him. All the mighty figures in the Immortal World were shocked by the power of the Ten Thousand Life Sword.
 In the endless sea, on an island.
 Huang Zuntian stood on the roof and looked at the sword shadows that filled the sky with excitement.
 He remembered that voice!
 “This Mystical Power is definitely from a Sage!”
 Huang Zuntian was extremely excited. He had indeed chosen the right person.
 Fortunately, he had always recognized Han Jue. Otherwise, if he betrayed him, the consequences would be unimaginable.
 The world fell silent in less than ten breaths of time.
 The Heavenly Devils of the myriad worlds were all annihilated as countless sword shadows descended. Mountains transformed back into mountains, clouds transformed back into clouds, and all things transformed back into their original forms.
 The power of a Sage was so powerful!
 Inside the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 Han Jue slowly put down his right hand.
 Under normal circumstances, if his Sage power was used in the area of the Heavenly Dao, it would be rejected by the Heavenly Dao. However, since the Heavenly Dao was being threatened by the Heavenly Devils and its providence weakened, and he was trying to eliminate the Heavenly Devils who harmed the Heavenly Dao, how could the Heavenly Dao stop him?
 Clearing the Heavenly Devils with one move!
 Han Jue was indifferent. After all, these were all small fries.
 The true enemy was still outside the 33rd Heaven.
 Han Jue looked down at the million disciples in the Hundred Peak Immortal River. Every disciple had a fanatical expression.
 “The Heavenly Devils of the myriad worlds have been eliminated. Is this what you wanted?” Han Jue asked. His words shocked the Hidden Sect disciples again.
 How long had it been?
 No one dared to answer his question. Everyone could tell that he was prepared to teach them a lesson.
 “The calamities of the Heavenly Dao will never be eliminated. Today, there are Heavenly Devils. In the future, we will definitely welcome an even stronger calamity. If you really want to protect the Heavenly Dao, you should cultivate diligently. If the million disciples of my Hidden Sect are all Zenith Heaven, how can the Heavenly Dao not be powerful?”
 Han Jue’s words echoed in the ears of the million disciples, making them feel ashamed.
 Chu Shiren also felt ashamed.
 They felt that the Heavenly Dao was about to die, but when they saw Han Jue attack, they understood that this calamity was only child’s play in the eyes of the strongest.
 Han Jue said, “Disperse. Cultivate well. Don’t have any distracting thoughts after entering the Hidden Sect. What nurtured you is not the Heavenly Dao, but the Hidden Sect.”
 Immediately after, he disappeared and returned to the Daoist temple.
 Sitting on the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus, Han Jue opened his choices and chose the first option
 -immediately come out of seclusion and kill the Heavenly Devils.
 (The Heavenly Devils have yet to be completely cleaned up. You can’t receive the reward.)
 Han Jue sighed. Indeed, he had to kill Dao Heavenly Devil first.
 He asked in his mind: “If I go and reinforce Qiu Xilai and focus on fighting with all my might, will I die?”
 (Ten billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?] Continue!
 (There is a 1% chance of death.]
 Han Jue showed a frown.
 “I want to know what the 1% chance is.”
 [Ten billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 (In the darkness, there is also the Dharma idol of the Dao Heavenly Devil. His strength is comparable to the main body.]
 Han Jue was enlightened.
 Not bad.
 Fortunately, he had the system. Otherwise, he might have really been plotted against by the Dao Heavenly Devil’s Dharma Idol.
 Han Jue entered the simulation trial again. This time, he set up five Dao Heavenly Devils to fight him.
 Because he didn’t know the Dao Heavenly Devil’s exact Mystical Power and Dharma Idol, he decided to set up two more Dao Heavenly Devils. If he could win, he wouldn’t be afraid of the other Dharma Idols.
 An hour later, Han Jue opened his eyes and exhaled.
 Not bad.
 He could kill him.
 It was just that it took a while.
 Han Jue continued the simulation trial. His 74 Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols had their own abilities. If they cooperated well, it would be very effective.
 He now wanted to find a strategy to quickly kill the five Dao Heavenly Devils.
 Outside the 33rd Heaven, the Sages gathered in a hall.
 South Extreme Heavenly Venerate’s expression was ugly as he said in a low voice, “You saw it, right? This kid is stronger than us, yet he refuses to make a move!”
 Fuxitian said, “He indeed has no reason to attack. He didn’t rely on the providence of the Heavenly Dao to attain the Dao. He even has very little Heavenly Dao Merit.”
 Emperor Xiao’s eyes flickered. “He should have absorbed the negative karma in the Nine Nether Purgatory to attain the Dao. His Sage power is extremely destructive and can directly destroy the Heavenly Devils. It’s truly terrifying. Even if we don’t abandon the Heavenly Dao’s providence, we might not be his match even if we join forces.”
 Sect Master Tian Jue’s expression was also ugly. They were about to beg for mercy, but now, there was another Han Jue.
 “In addition, Han Jue’s strength should prove that he’s not the Dark Forbidden Lord. There’s no need for him to hide and curse us,” Emperor Xiao added and looked at the other three Sages.
 South Extreme Heavenly Venerate was furious, but he could not refute.
 It made sense. If they had Han Jue’s strength and disliked anyone, would they still need to hide and curse them?
 Previously, Sect Master Tian Jue had threatened to destroy the Hidden Sect. Han Jue had a reason to attack them and was not afraid that he would lose his reputation.
 If Han Jue wasn’t the Dark Forbidden Lord, who was he?
 Emperor Xiao said, “It’s really strange that Li Muyi left at this time. The ones who attacked the Chiliocosm World were not the Heavenly Devils.”
 Fuxitian frowned. “You mean Li Muyi is acting?”
 “That’s right. After this battle ends, we can’t be considered Heavenly Dao Sages. It’s very likely that Qiu Xilai and the Dao Heavenly Devil will both be injured. Once Li Muyi returns, who will dare to challenge him? So far, there’s actually one person who has not been cursed by the Dark Forbidden Lord. That person is Li Muyi.”
 Emperor Xiao spoke very calmly, making it difficult to guess what he was thinking.
 South Extreme Heavenly Venerate and Sect Master Tian Jue were silent. It was indeed too coincidental!
 At this moment…
 A terrifying sound came from outside the hall.
 A hole was torn in the chaos, and a golden light sped out. It was Qiu Xilai.
 At this moment, Qiu Xilai was in an extremely sorry state. His golden Buddha body was covered in cracks as if it would shatter at any moment.
 “Fellow Daoists, save me!” Qiu Xilai shouted anxiously. Upon hearing this, the four Heavenly Dao Sages immediately moved over and blocked in front of him.
 The black hole was like a chasm. It was extremely huge. A pair of blood-red eyes appeared in it. They were larger than any Sage Palace in the 33rd Heaven.
 Dao Heavenly Devil!
T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by nov(ê(l)biin.co/m “What? You only have four helpers?”
 A cold laugh filled with mockery sounded.
 Furious, the four Sages took out their Dharma treasures.
 They were all Heavenly Dao Sages. They couldn’t retreat like Han Jue and could only fight.
 Once the Dao Heavenly Devil penetrated the 33rd Heaven and the Heavenly Dao was destroyed, they would also die!
 Qiu Xilai gritted his teeth and said, “There are even more Heavenly Devils inside. They far exceed the number of Heavenly Devils from before. Furthermore, their cultivation levels are even stronger!”
 Terror flashed across his eyes.
 He tried his best to hide it. He couldn’t be afraid.
 If he was afraid and gave up, the Heavenly Dao would really die here!
