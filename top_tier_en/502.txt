 There were indeed many legends about the Four Chaotic Monkeys. Han Jue wouldn’t question their potential, but he didn’t expect them to have a race.
 Han Jue narrowed his eyes and asked, “What do you think?”
 Li Xuan’ao adjusted his emotions and said, “There’s not much point in directly taking in the Long-arm Ape Race into the Hidden Sect. We need to have hidden forces outside. This is the case for the Human School. Almost all the major races have their own subsidiary forces. On the surface, only me and Senior Brother will appear. With the Immeasurable Calamity activated, even if Senior Brother and I enter the calamity, all living beings will not think that the Human School can threaten the Heavenly Dao. However, the truth is that the Human School has the most cultivators in the Heavenly Race. Among the Sages, the Human School is the greatest winner.”
 Han Jue understood what he meant. He felt that there was no need, but if the disciples wanted to find something to do, it was fine.
 He thought for a moment and said, “Choose a Long-arm Ape to enter the Hidden Sect. You can persuade him later.”
 Li Xuan’ao was overjoyed. He hurriedly bowed and left.
 Han Jue wasn’t worried that he would play tricks. After all, it was a six-star favorability. Besides, he was already a cultivator of the Great Dao of Extreme Origin and was tied to him.
 Seventy-four years later.
 In the Daoist temple, Han Jue was cultivating.
 “I’m the War God of the Heavenly Race, the Heavenly God General. I summon all living beings in the Immortal World and recruit immortals and gods for the Heavenly Race. I will open up the myriad worlds in the universe. Anyone who has reached the Grand Unity Golden Immortal Realm can come to the 13th Heaven to see me and seek godhood!”
 This voice resounded through the Immortal World like a thunderclap.
 Han Jue opened his eyes with a strange expression.
 The Heavenly Race was recruiting Immortal Gods!
 They were trying to eradicate the Heavenly Court!
 From now on, all living beings would think that the Heavenly Race represented the Immortal Gods. What was the use of the Heavenly Court?
 When the immortals of the Heavenly Court decreased and only Fang Liang was left alone, it would probably be the time of his death.
 Han Jue couldn’t help but think of the Heavenly Emperor.
 The Heavenly Emperor had entrusted him to help when the Heavenly Court was in danger.
 However, this was not the most difficult time for the Heavenly Court. Han Jue didn’t dare to act recklessly before attaining the Dao.

 Han Jue snorted. The Heavenly Race also wanted to scheme against him, and now they were plotting against the Heavenly Court. He had to deal with them in the future.
 Han Jue suddenly thought of his first Dao Companion, Xuan Qingjun, who was also in the Heavenly Race.
 On a whim, he used the Dark Nightmare on her.
 The two of them entered the dream.
 The mountains were clear and the rivers were beautiful. The blue sky was filled with white clouds. A cool breeze blew through the forest, making one’s heart flutter.
 Han Jue saw Xuan Qingjun again. Compared to twenty thousand years ago, she had changed greatly. She wore a purple dress and had a dignified posture. Her beautiful face was extremely cold and her eyes were disdainful.
 The first time they met, she was still pretending to be mediocre.
 Xuan Qingjun saw Han Jue and couldn’t help but become vigilant. The divine light of the Sun and Moon Yin-Yang Protection covered Han Jue’s face, preventing her from seeing clearly.
 She was cultivating when she was suddenly pulled into a dream, making her subconsciously vigilant.
 Soon, she seemed to have thought of something and asked carefully, “Han Jue?”
 Han Jue smiled and said, “How have you
 been?”
 The last time they met was in a dream, ten thousand years ago.
 At this age, he couldn’t help but sigh when he saw an old friend.
 It was mainly because Han Jue had not seen many people in his life. If one died, it was a significant decrease.
 Xuan Qingjun smiled and sized him up. “I’m good. You look better. You should be the one who created the Hidden Sect, right?”
 Han Jue was not surprised. He could no longer hide his identity, especially to those who knew him.
 “That’s right. How are you doing in the Heavenly Race?” Han Jue asked. He remembered that she had given him cultivation resources before. Xuan Qingjun said, “I managed to get a god position, but I’m only fishing in troubled waters. I don’t have any real power. By the way, the Heavenly Race might be targeting the Hundred Peak Immortal River recently. Be careful.”
 Han Jue said, “I already know. I haven’t come to visit you for a long time. If you’re unhappy in the Heavenly Race, you can come and seek refuge with me at any time. As for the Heavenly Race’s plot, even a Pseudo-Sage can’t barge in. It’s impossible for the Heavenly Race to succeed.”
 Xuan Qingjun smiled. “Sure, I’m willing to join the Hidden Sect.”
 So straightforward?
 Han Jue was stunned.
 Xuan Qingjun said, “I like the atmosphere of the Hidden Sect. I didn’t agree before because I wanted to fight for providence. Now that the providence has been obtained, if you let me enter the Hidden Sect, I’ll naturally do it. However, before I come, I want to obtain something for you.”
 “What is it?”
 “You will know when the time comes. It will definitely be a surprise.”
 “Alright!”
 Han Jue smiled and agreed.
 What?
 Could she possibly bring the Primordial Purple Qi to seek refuge with him?
 Han Jue started to reminisce with Xuan Qingjun and listened to her talk about her experiences over the years.
 Xuan Qingjun said that because of Han Jue, she also liked to cultivate diligently. After the calamity ended, she rarely went out. However, the few times she went out were very exciting. They could all be written as adventures. Han Jue also listened with relish.
 The two of them chatted for a long time.
 The dream ended.
 Han Jue’s consciousness returned to reality.
 From his conversation with Xuan Qingjun, he could tell that she was very dissatisfied with the Heavenly Race. She wasn’t the only one. There were also many conflicts within the Heavenly Race.
 The main reason was that the Heavenly Race was too chaotic and had too much internal competition.
 With that, the Emperor took turns to sit.
 Ji Xianshen had already completely become a puppet. Power often changed, making the Loose Immortals of the Heavenly Race feel that something was wrong.
 If this continued, the Heavenly Race would definitely collapse.
 It was normal for Xuan Qingjun to want to leave.
 Han Jue thought silently, “Should I make the Heavenly Race fight among themselves?”
 Xuan Qingjun had mentioned that the person in charge recently was a person called Zhou Quan. His background was mysterious, and she did not know which sect he came from. He had a wide network.
 F*ck!
 Han Jue decided to curse Zhou Quan and stir up a conflict among the Heavenly Race to prevent them from always staring at the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 But he couldn’t curse now.
 Wait!
 Fifty years later.
 Han Jue had just finished cursing Sage Fated Secrets and started cursing the Heavenly Race’s Zhou Quan.
 He was very careful, afraid that he would accidentally curse Zhou Quan to death.
 He only cursed for a day before stopping.
 He felt that it was enough.
 Zhou Quan would definitely be frightened to death.
 Han Jue was in a good mood. He put down the Book of Misfortune and continued cultivating.
 Just as he had expected, the Heavenly Race was in chaos!
 Through the emails, Han Jue saw the Divine General and Ji Xianshen being attacked one after another. It was really tragic.
 Half a month later.
 Li Xuan’ao came and said that the Long-arm Ape he had chosen was already waiting outside the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 Han Jue directly moved him into the Dao Field and let Li Xuan’ao entertain him himself.
 As for meeting the Long-arm Ape, Han Jue didn’t have any thoughts for the time being.
 His cultivation was different now, and his identity was also different. How could he meet anyone casually? On the mountains and rivers, Li Xuan’ao and the Long-arm Ape stepped on the white clouds as they advanced. The Long-arm Ape was a human-shaped monkey with a burly figure. It scratched its ears and cheeks and kept looking around, full of curiosity about the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 Li Xuan’ao instructed, “In the Hundred Peak Immortal River, don’t cause conflict with anyone. Otherwise, I won’t be able to protect you.”
 The Long-arm Ape asked curiously, “How many immortals in the Hundred Peak Immortal River are stronger than you?”
