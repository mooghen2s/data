 Chu Shiren knelt down respectfully without the bearing of a Buddha.
 Han Jue smiled and asked, “What’s the matter?”
 Chu Shiren looked up at him and was secretly shocked.
 Had he really just entered the Zenith Heaven Realm?
 The aura emitted by Han Jue was stronger than those old Zenith Heaven cultivators.
 In addition, after entering the Connate Cave Abode, he had a bone-chilling feeling, as if there was some evil creature secretly watching him, ready to pounce on him at any time. This feeling was indescribable, making him uneasy.
 This feeling made Chu Shiren respect Han Jue even more.
 Chu Shiren adjusted his emotions and said softly, “Grandmaster, can you teach me your Mystical Power?”
 In the recent hundred-year competition, he discovered that his Mystical Powers were inferior to Li Yao, Tu Ling’er, and the others.
 In his previous life, he was a Buddha. He had learned the Buddhist Dharma methods. Although his cultivation level was high, his Mystical Powers were not good.
 The Mystical Powers he grasped were greatly inferior to the ones Han Jue taught. Han Jue smiled and said, “If you become an Immortal Emperor, I will teach you a Supreme Mystical Power.” Chu Shiren looked up and asked, “Really?”
 “Yes, I’ve always looked forward to your growth.”
 “Thank you, Grandmaster!”
 After bowing, Chu Shiren hurriedly left.
 Han Jue glared at the Strange Deity beside him. This fellow had been lying beside Chu Shiren just now and clearly made him uncomfortable.
 Han Jue was still very glad about the change in Chu Shiren.
 If not for his different ideals, he would probably become the strongest among the five Great Buddhas.
 After Chu Shiren left, Han Jue continued cultivating
 The Strange Deity lay on his back.
 Ever since it helped Han Jue reach the Zenith Heaven Realm, the Strange Deity often helped him absorb negative karma. With its help, Han Jue’s absorption speed far exceeded his own cultivation speed. Not only that, but the Strange Deity was also becoming stronger. Han Jue had entered a simulation trial with it not long ago. This fellow already had the combat strength of a Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal.
 However, it was ignorant and did not have any fancy Mystical Powers. It fought too directly and clumsily.
 Han Jue and the Strange Deity seemed to be entering a strange coexistence state.
 In this coexisting state, the stronger Han Jue was, the stronger the Strange Deity became. Furthermore, Han Jue could completely control the other party’s life and death.
 It was as if…
 Han Jue inexplicably thought of the fantasy novels he had read in his previous life. This was like a martial soul?
 Interesting! With the Strange Deity’s presence, Han Jue would be equivalent to having an active avatar in future battles. He would also have three thousand Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols.
 An army by himself?
 Han Jue was excited.
 He wanted to be invincible among those of the same realm. This was the case for Zenith Heaven, and it was the same even after he had attained the Dao!
 Time passed quickly. Fifty years passed in the blink of an eye. Han Jue maintained the frequency of cursing once every ten years. Jade Emperor Zhou Yan was fine, but he didn’t cause trouble recently.
 The recent Immortal World was extremely harmonious. It was so harmonious that Han Jue thought that the calamity had ended.
 This was until he saw an email. [Your grand-disciple Fang Liang received the inheritance of your enemy Jade Emperor Zhou Yan. His cultivation has increased greatly.]
 What the hell?
 Fang Liang had submitted to the enemy?
 Or did Jade Emperor Zhou Yan bow down to him?
 Han Jue wanted to use the derivation function to understand, but on second thought, there was no need.
 In any case, the outcome of the calamity had already changed. Jade Emperor Zhou Yan couldn’t laugh until the end. Why should he care about his current situation?
 There were six-star Hatred Points. No matter what, he had to curse him to death to prevent future trouble!
 “I can’t let him have a chance to rise again or clear his name.”
 Han Jue thought silently. His cultivation had increased quite a lot recently. He could squander his lifespan to celebrate.
Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com He locked the Strange Deity into the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus and took out the Book of Misfortune to curse Jade Emperor Zhou Yan.
 Five days later.
 Han Jue’s lifespan began to decrease.
 In the imperial garden in the ninth level of the Immortal World.
 Fang Liang, Jade Emperor Zhou Yan, and Great Nine Heavens were sitting around the stone table. Great Nine Heavens revealed his true appearance. He looked like a scholar, but his figure was extremely burly.
 “I only have one request. Let the Heavenly Emperor go,” Fang Liang said. Jade Emperor Zhou Yan shook his head and said, “He faked his death. I didn’t torture him. He’s doing well now. If you’re worried, I can let you interact with him.”
 Fang Liang nodded slowly.
 He looked at Great Nine Heavens and said, “Can you represent the Chan School?” Great Nine Heavens said, “Of course, we can. The humans’ rise is unstoppable. This calamity has already become clear. It will definitely be a war between humans and gods. Other Sages among the humans have arrived first. The Heavenly Court is also a force supported by the Dao Sect. We have no choice.”
 Fang Liang’s eyes flickered. He was suffering inside.
 After all, he was also a human.
 Great Nine Heavens continued, “His Majesty needs the help of the two of us. The Heavenly Court will definitely be powerful. If the humans win, what do you think they will do to them? The Heavenly Court can tolerate humans, but humans can’t tolerate the Heavenly Court.” Fang Liang frowned. This was very realistic and also the truth.
 He had lived in the mortal world and knew the evil of human nature.
 If the humans defeated the Heavenly Court, the Immortal Gods would no longer exist. Even if they survived, they would live an ignoble life.
 To let the Immortal Gods be slaves of the human race, could they still be considered Immortal Gods, then?
 “If the Heavenly Court wins, we will obtain great providence. With His Majesty’s decision, the humans will also have a chance of survival.” Great Nine Heavens continued to persuade. Fang Liang sighed. He knew that the other party was plotting something, but he couldn’t refuse.
 The current Heavenly Court was not as strong as before. The various forces in the Immortal World were overthrowing the rule of the immortals. If this continued, even if they didn’t encounter powerful enemies, the Heavenly Court would only exist in name.
 As the Heavenly Emperor, Fang Liang had to do something
 Just as he was hesitating, Jade Emperor Zhou Yan suddenly spat out a mouthful of blood, causing the stone table to instantly turn into dust. Fang Liang was so shocked that he stood up and retreated.
 Jade Emperor Zhou Yan hurriedly meditated and circulated his energy to suppress the powerful curse.
 Great Nine Heavens frowned and asked, “The Dark Forbidden Lord?”.
 Jade Emperor Zhou Yan’s face was pale as he replied, “Who else could it be?”
 His tone was filled with helplessness. Now, even his anger was gone.
 He was already used to it.
 Fang Liang asked, “Can’t the Chan School deduce who the Dark Forbidden Lord is?”
 Great Nine Heavens and Jade Emperor Zhou Yan were silent.
 That’s right!
 Even Sages could not deduce it!
 This was the most terrifying thing.
 Jade Emperor Zhou Yan couldn’t help but feel despair.
 Being pestered by the Dark Forbidden Lord, he might one day face the calamity of death.
 Suddenly!
 An even stronger curse attacked. Jade Emperor Zhou Yan’s expression changed drastically as he hurriedly said, “Quick, use your Dharmic powers to help me suppress the Dao Fruit!”
 Great Nine Heavens arrived behind Jade Emperor Zhou Yan and pressed his palm on his back.
 Soon, Great Nine Heavens couldn’t help but be moved.
 He had never been cursed by the Dark Forbidden Lord, so he had always been suspicious.
 Was the Dark Forbidden Lord’s curse really that terrifying?
 But now…
 So powerful!
 “That fellow is definitely cursing with his lifespan. Could it be that he is sacrificing the lives of countless living beings, so he only curses once every ten years?”
 Great Nine Heavens frowned as he thought about it. The more he thought about it, the more he felt that this was the case.
 What a ruthless Dark Forbidden Lord!
 It was truly a crime punishable by death!
 In Great Nine Heavens’ mind, the Dark Forbidden Lord became evil and cruel.
 Fang Liang watched from the side and noticed the change in their expressions.
 He had an idea.
 Were the two of them desperate and deliberately trying to deceive him?
