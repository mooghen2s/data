 It was enough to curse Sage Fated Secrets until he went mad. If he continued cursing, the Heavenly Dao might collapse again.
 Han Jue only wanted to hide in the Dao Field and cultivate.
 Three years later.
 “I’m Daoist Qing Tian. In the extreme South, in the Scarlet Green Sea, I will set up a Dao Field to preach the Dao for all living beings. I will talk about the Immortal Dao and the Sage Dao. In a hundred years, when the lecture begins, all living beings can come and listen to the Dao and comprehend the power of immortality!”
 A voice resounded in the Immortal World. Han Jue counted with his fingers. The other party was only a Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal.
 A Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal dared to preach the Sage Dao?
 He was really courting death!
 Aren’t you afraid of offending a Sage?
 On second thought, the other party might be the disciple of a Sage.
 Han Jue shook his head and laughed.
 In the next thousand years, many mighty figures sent voice transmissions to the entire Immortal World to preach the Dao. There was a trend of hundreds of families fighting. A thousand years later, Han Jue was finally close to the perfected Pseudo-Sage Realm.
 It had been nearly seven thousand years since his last breakthrough.
 Han Jue was excited. He first cursed Sage Fated Secrets to celebrate.
 Five days later, the curse ended and Han Jue continued cultivating.
 In one go!
 He had reached perfection!
 At the same time, an uninvited guest arrived outside the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 These were three living beings that looked like humans but had inhuman faces. They arrived at the top of a hill. The person in the lead was a living being with an eagle head and a human body. He wore a purple robe with a crimson edge.
 The eagle-headed creature frowned. “My divine sense can’t spy on it at all. As expected of the number one forbidden land in the Immortal World.”
 The snake-headed creature beside him asked, “Brother, are we going to barge in forcefully?”
 The eagle-headed living being shook his head. “We can’t act rashly without certainty. It’s not easy for us three immortals to come this far. We can’t be careless. There are many mighty figures hidden in the Immortal World. If there are mighty figures in the Hundred Peak Immortal River, we have to be polite.”
 The other two living beings looked at each other and nodded silently.
 Thus, the three immortals began to take root nearby and create their own cave abode.
 Under the Fusang Tree.
 The Black Hell Chicken shouted, “There are three transformed living beings living outside the Hundred Peak Immortal River. They’re all Immortal Emperors.”
 Ah Da snorted. “What’s there to care about mere Immortal Emperors?”
 Xiao Er nodded.
 Immortal Emperor!
 The Hidden Sect didn’t lack Immortal Emperors at all!
 After so many years, they and the Nether Race had already begun to break through to the Deity Realm!
 The Chaotic Heavenly Dog asked curiously, “Don’t tell me they want to barge into our Hundred Peak Immortal River?”
 “No way?”
 “Tsk tsk, do you think they have dog brains?”
 “What do you mean? Be polite. He’s Master Chicken’s son!”
 “You… are all not human!”
 “Alright, don’t bully the Heavenly Dog. He has the backing of the second guardian now. It’s impressive.”
 The Hidden Sect disciples under the Fusang Tree began to chat and laugh. They did not think much of the three immortals.
 Not to mention an Immortal Emperor, even if a Pseudo-Sage attacked, the Hidden Sect disciples would not panic.
 Five hundred years later.
 Han Jue finally reached the point where he could break through. In a good mood, he immediately started his seclusion.
 While he was in seclusion, the three immortals finally couldn’t sit still anymore.
 They began to attempt to enter the Hundred Peak Immortal River, but they were blocked by the array formation.
 “How dare you!”
 A shout sounded, scaring the three immortals away.
 A white-robed man appeared in the sky above the Hundred Peak Immortal River, looking down at them.
 An expert! The three immortals were shocked by the other party’s temperament. It was as if they had seen a legendary Sage.
 Eagle Head Immortal said, “We’re the Three Immortals of Qu Jun, we are specially here to pay our respects to the Hundred Peak Immortal River. Before this matter, we have already stayed for five hundred years and have not seen anyone. Therefore, we tried trespassing. I hope that senior will not be angry. In addition, can you accept us?”
Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates The white-robed man frowned. “Take you in? I can’t make the decision. I advise you to give up. You can’t barge in even if you’re a Pseudo-Sage.”
 He could not make a decision?
 Eagle Head Immortal asked carefully, “What’s your position in the Hundred Peak Immortal River…”
 “In-name disciple! It’s nothing. It’s just that I live in the border area, so I came to stop you. I advise you not to act recklessly. Otherwise, our Hidden Sect’s mighty figure can destroy your body and soul in one go,” the white-robed man said impatiently.
 In-name disciple?
 The three immortals were shocked. At this moment, the white-robed man turned around and went back in, quickly disappearing.
 Snake Head Immortal said excitedly, “Brother, there really is a peerless mighty figure here!”
 Eagle Head Immortal took a deep breath and said, “We can’t leave. Since the mighty figures of the Hundred Peak Immortal River didn’t attack us, it means that they are compassionate. As long as we show enough sincerity, we will definitely be able to move them. Besides, our potential is not bad!”
 The other two immortals nodded in agreement.
 They called themselves the Three Immortals, but they knew that they were not immortals at all.
 They needed a backing!
 Thus, the Three Immortals of Qu Jun continued to stay near the Hundred Peak Immortal River. Every once in a while, they would come to the formation and kowtow, wanting to move the mighty figure.
 Just like that.
 Fifty years passed.
 Han Jue successfully broke through!
 His Dharmic powers soared. The feeling of becoming stronger brought great satisfaction to his empty heart. He checked his attributes panel.
 [Name: Han Jue]
 (Race: Primordial Fiendcelestial (Immeasurable Emperor)]
 (Cultivation: Perfected Pseudo Primordial Chaos Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm]
 (Technique: Primordial Chaos Reincarnation Great Dao (Great Dao), Heavenly Cycle Body Tempering]
 (Great Dao: Great Dao of Life and Death, Great Dao of Karma, Great Dao of Extreme Origin]
 His lifespan did not double. It increased by a third.
 Next, Han Jue could attempt Dao attainment!
 He continued to consolidate his cultivation for another 27 years.
 In a few months, he raised all his Sword Dao Mystical Powers to their limits.
 Han Jue was about to cultivate the Grand Unity Aspect when Han Zuitian came to seek an audience.
 Han Jue let him enter the Daoist temple.
 Han Zuitian knelt in front of him and said, “Grandmaster, recently, many transformed living beings have come to the Hundred Peak Immortal River. They’re all from various providence sects. It’s said that the Hundred Peak Immortal River contains Primordial Purple Qi for attaining the Dao. This is not
 good.”
 His expression was grave.
 The array formation of the Hundred Peak Immortal River was strong, but it could not stop the gathering of all living beings.
 Han Jue said, “So be it. They can’t barge in.”
 Primordial Purple Qi?
 It was unknown who was playing tricks, but he would deal with them later!
 Han Jue only wanted to attain the Dao first.
 Han Zuitian asked carefully, “I heard from the living beings outside that it was said by a Sage. This means a lot. Who doesn’t believe the words of a Sage? At that time, even a Pseudo-Sage might come. Can our array formation block it?”
 Han Jue’s eyes turned cold. “Mind your own business and go cultivate. The Hidden Sect has experienced the Immeasurable Calamity. What haven’t we seen? Don’t spread such words in the sect and affect the others’ cultivation mood, understand?”
 In an instant, Han Zuitian felt a terrifying pressure and almost suffocated. He hurriedly nodded.
 Han Jue waved his hand and gestured for him to leave.
 Han Zuitian hurriedly left the Daoist temple.
 “Sage?”
 Han Jue was disdainful. He didn’t directly deduce which Sage it was. At this juncture, he definitely couldn’t curse that Sage directly. Once he did, it was very likely that his identity would be exposed.
 In any case, it was useless even if a Sage personally barged in.
 Han Jue only had one goal now.
 Become a Sage!
