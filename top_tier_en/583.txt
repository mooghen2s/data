 Since Han Tuo and Immortal Emperor Samsara wanted to enter the Divine Palace, Han Jue naturally wouldn’t stop them.
 He couldn’t put all the eggs in one basket. If all the major factions in the Immortal World had disciples of the Hidden Sect, it would be easier for them to survive in the future.
 Although Han Jue was so strong now and the Hidden Sect looked invincible, who knew what the future would be like?
 Didn’t the almighty Dao Sect also disband in the end?
 Han Jue said, “I’ll help you convince them.”
 Hearing this, Zhang Guxing was pleasantly surprised and hurriedly thanked him.
 Not long ago, Han Jue also thanked him like this.
 Zhang Guxing looked up and asked, “Han Tuo still doesn’t know his background. What do you plan to do?”
 Han Jue replied, “Maintain the current situation. I have my own plans.”
 “Alright!”
 Han Jue waved his sleeve and moved Zhang Guxing out to prevent the two of them from falling into an awkward situation.
 Tens of thousands of years were enough time to change a lot of things. At least, the relationship between the two had become subtle. Han Jue wasn’t in the mood to reminisce. He believed that Zhang Guxing was also not in the mood to chat.
 That was the truth.
 After leaving the Hundred Peak Immortal River, Zhang Guxing heaved a sigh of relief. He smiled bitterly and muttered to himself, “Sages are really impressive.”
 Sitting in front of Han Jue, he felt extremely stressed. His heartbeat accelerated every time he looked at the other party.
 Although it was rough, the difference between the two was too great. He couldn’t stabilize his Dao heart at all.
 No matter what, Han Jue agreed to his request.
 He knew Han Jue very well. He wouldn’t make a promise easily. He was definitely confident.
 Looking back at the past, Zhang Guxing sighed.
 The youth who had been trapped in the mortal world by the Vermilion Bird and did not dare to ascend had actually become a Sage now.
 Zhang Guxing didn’t think that Han Jue’s potential was good. No matter how good his potential was, he couldn’t have become a Sage in tens of thousands of years. Presumably, Han Jue was a Sage himself and had only descended into the mortal world to train.
 “The Divine Palace in my hands will surpass my predecessors!”
 Zhang Guxing thought with a burning gaze and immediately flew into the sky.
 On the other side, Han Jue sent a dream to the South Extreme Heavenly Venerate.
 The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate agreed readily and said that he was willing to give Han Jue face. He even chatted with him for a while and agreed to discuss the Dao.
 After the dream ended, Han Jue cursed silently. The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate was really shameless!
 He wouldn’t hit a smiling person. Because of this, Han Jue owed the South Extreme Heavenly Venerate a favor.
 However, as long as the South Extreme Heavenly Venerate didn’t oppose him, he could still tolerate it.
 Eighty years later.
 “I, Zhang Guxing, follow the will of my predecessors and recreate the Divine Palace. Those with outstanding potential in the myriad worlds can enter the Divine Palace. The Divine Palace is ranked by potential. I want to create a sect that is absolutely fair to the prodigies. I want to use my own strength to fight for the Heavenly Dao’s providence!”
 Zhang Guxing’s voice resounded throughout the Immortal World, but it did not attract much attention.
 Ever since the birth of the Famous Race, the mighty figures who established providence sects would use certain gimmicks to promote themselves Immortal World.
 Han Jue counted with his fingers. Han Tuo and Immortal Emperor Samsara had already joined the Divine Palace. Not only them, but even the previous Sect Master of the Jie School, Jing Tiangong, and the Demon Saint, Yi Tian, had joined it.
 Currently, the Divine Palace had more than ten thousand disciples. Other than Jing Tiangong and Immortal Emperor Samsara, there were no Zenith Heaven Golden Immortals for the time being
 Han Jue turned his gaze to Han Yu.
 Ever since he cultivated the Six Paths of Reincarnation Technique, Han Yu’s cultivation level had increased day by day. However, compared to Han Tuo, his potential was too poor. Currently, there was no hope of him reaching the Deity Realm unless Han Jue thought of a way to increase his potential.
 Han Jue did not have any expectations. This only added a hint of joy to his boring cultivation years, just like the dramas in his previous life.
 The one he really looked forward to was Han
 Tuo.
 Han Jue hoped that his son could transform into a Primordial Fiendcelestial!
 Han Yu was still in seclusion in the valley. Han Jue looked away after a while and continued cultivating
 Above the sea of clouds, palaces floated one after another. Countless figures shuttled back and forth, casting spells on the palaces and condensing them. Dressed in black, Han Tuo stood in front of the door of a palace. He looked at the steadily increasing Divine Palace and sighed.
 After cultivating for so long, he finally had a place to stay. The Divine Palace was newly established. He was one of the core members and was currently one of its leaders.
 He knew very well that compared to the other leaders, he was the weakest.
 The new Jing Tiangong even raised doubts. At that time, Yi Tian almost attacked him. Fortunately, Zhang Guxing and Immortal Emperor Samsara stood up to support him. This matter ended there.
𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com Someone doubted. Han Tuo was not angry. Instead, he was stimulated.
 After watching the Divine Palace disciples for a while, Han Tuo turned around and entered his chamber to continue cultivating.
 Sitting on the mat, Han Tuo closed his eyes.
 He was suddenly pulled into a dream.
 This was a forest. A figure shining with divine light stood in front of him.
 Han Tuo was shocked.
 What happened?
 How can I not notice? Han Tuo looked at the other party warily and asked in a low voice, “Who are you?”
 The divine light figure was naturally Han Jue. Han Jue asked in an ethereal voice, “I see that you are unwilling. You seem to be dissatisfied with your cultivation. I can teach you a Dao technique, but you have to pay the price. Are you willing?” Han Tuo frowned when he heard this.
 His first reaction was to reject, but on second thought, if the other party was so powerful and wanted to harm him, why did he have to beat around the bush?
 Han Tuo asked, “What do I have to do? I don’t even know who you are. Why should I believe
 you?”
 “In the past, you came looking for me.”
 “I looked for you?”
 Han Tuo frowned and fell into deep thought. He was suddenly moved.
 “You are the master of the Hidden Sect?”
 “This matter cannot be spread. I will teach you a Dao technique. You owe me your life. In the future, I need you to do something. As for whether you will offer your life, that will depend on whether you work hard enough. As long as you are strong enough, no matter how strong an opponent is, they will fall under your feet.”
 Han Jue’s tone was bewitching.
 Han Tuo fell silent again.
 If it was Han Jue, he would definitely reject, but he wanted to know what Han Tuo would choose.
 In fact, Han Jue could use the derivation function to deduce, but there was no need. If that happened, he would lose the joy of anticipation, and it would also be a waste of his lifespan.
 “I agree!” Han Tuo said in a low voice.
 “I know that my potential is very strong, but it’s not enough. In terms of potential, I’m inferior to Yi Tian. In terms of cultivation, I’m inferior to Jing Tiangong. I need a huge opportunity. Senior, please teach me your Dao technique!”
 “Mm.”
 Han Jue didn’t say anything else and started to preach the Great Dao of Extreme Origin.
 Inside the Daoist temple.
 Han Jue opened his eyes. He had preached the Dao for Han Tuo alone for a hundred years and had finally introduced him to the Great Dao of Extreme Origin. Presumably, in the following period of time, Han Tuo’s cultivation would advance by leaps and bounds. He would also loosen the suppression on Han Tuo’s bloodline and let his potential increase again. As for Jing Tiangong, although he was his believer, Han Jue didn’t stop him. He was happy to see him bringing pressure to Han Tuo to prevent him from stopping.
 Of course, if the two of them really had a death grudge, Han Jue would still come forward.
 He had always found Jing Tiangong pleasing to the eye.
