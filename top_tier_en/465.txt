 Fang Liang was silent for a moment before saying, “This is already the best outcome I can think of. Ji Xianshen and I have a close relationship. If we join forces, it’s equivalent to controlling the Heavenly Dao Race and the Heavenly Dao forces. In the future, we won’t have to listen to the Sages anymore.”
 Han Jue couldn’t help but recall that Ji Xianshen and Fang Liang indeed had a good relationship. They had been together for thousands of years.
 However, if it was Han Jue, he would definitely not rely on others.
 “Forget it. As long as there are risks, I won’t let your fellow disciples enter easily,” Han Jue said calmly.
 Fang Liang sighed. He was not surprised.
 He asked curiously, “Which disciple in the Hidden Sect is the strongest now?”
 Han Jue said, “The strongest is only an Immortal Emperor.”
 “Not bad.”
 “Indeed, cultivation is still very useful.”
 “Grandmaster is right.”
 The two of them chatted for a while before cutting off the connection.
 At the Numinous Palace.
 Fang Liang put down the Heavenly Dao Token and sighed silently.
 Grandmaster became polite. Their relationship seemed to be pulling apart.
 To be precise, Grandmaster was worried that he would implicate the Hidden Sect disciples.
 Fang Liang couldn’t help but reflect. Was he really on the right path?
 He didn’t believe that the strongest disciple of the Hidden Sect was an Immortal Emperor. Someone had definitely reached the Deity Realm!
 At this moment, the Divine General walked into the hall.
 He came in front of Fang Liang and bowed. “Your Majesty, the human Holy Lands that the Buddhist Sect, Jie School, Chan School, Human School, and the Heavenly Race rely on have all appeared one after another. They’re all plotting. What should our Heavenly Court do?”
 Fang Liang said, “The Heavenly Dao has restarted and all living beings have yet to appear. What should we do now? We can only occupy territory.”
 The Divine General said, “Your Majesty, you can ask the Fang Clan to descend into the mortal world first and continue to reproduce. They will become a huge clan in the future.”
 “Yes, that’s a good idea.”
 Fang Liang changed the topic and asked, “What about the Heavenly God General and the Martial God General?”
 The Divine General said calmly, “They have already joined the Human School.”
 Fang Liang was silent.
 After experiencing the Immeasurable Calamity, there were less than a hundred immortals in the entire Heavenly Court. All the Heavenly Troops had died because of the Dao Destruction Mystical Power.
 Desolate and empty. This was the current Heavenly Court.
 The Divine General seemed to notice that Fang Liang was not in a good mood and said in consolation, “Your Majesty, it’s already a great blessing that the Heavenly Court survived. We’ve experienced the calamity of the Sage War. Your contributions are already great enough, there’s no need to blame yourself.”
 Fang Liang smiled and said, “I have you, the Divine General, so I naturally have expectations.”
 Another ten years passed.
 Han Jue took out the Book of Misfortune and cursed Sage Fated Secrets while checking his emails.
 [Your disciple Zhao Xuanyuan has obtained a Human Race Supreme Treasure. His providence has increased greatly.)
 (Your good friend Li Daokong has received guidance from a Sage. His providence has been enlightened and his cultivation has increased greatly.) [Your good friend Dao Comprehension Sword has obtained a Heavenly Dao Numinous Treasure. Her providence has increased greatly.] [Your good friend Dao Sovereign accidentally entered the Primordial Race’s territory.]
 (Your good friend Ah Da devoured the spirit meridian and his cultivation increased greatly.]
 (Your good friend Xiao Er has devoured a spirit meridian and his cultivation has increased greatly.] [Your good friend Zhou Fan was resurrected by a mysterious mighty figure and returned to the Immortal World.]
 (Your good friend Empress Houtu has recovered the Six Paths of Reincarnation.]
 It was all opportunities!
 Han Jue wasn’t surprised to see Zhou Fan revived again.
 It was obvious that the Seven Dao Sage of the Great Dao Spirit had designs on the Heavenly Dao, so he had resurrected Zhou Fan time and time again.
 Poor Mo Fuchou was buried with him.
 Five days later.
 Han Jue finished cursing and was about to continue cultivating.
 [Detected bearer of Connate providence, check its origin.)
 Eh?
 It had been a long time since he saw such a notification. Han Jue actually felt refreshed.
 He immediately checked.
 [Falling Heavenly Stone: Connate lifeform, the first stone spirit after the Heavenly Dao restarted. It contains the providence of the Heavenly Dao.]
 The number one stone spirit of the Heavenly Dao should be the first stone spirit.
 Han Jue immediately checked the location of the Falling Heavenly Stone. It was in the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 It was a black stone. Han Jue could already sense its intelligence.
 After thinking about it, Han Jue decided not to disturb it for the time being. He would wait until it was about to transform.
 “In the future, more and more Connate lifeforms will appear. It feels like the world has just opened.”
 Han Jue thought silently and looked forward to it.
 Countless years later, he would be the legendary ancestor who had achieved the Dao. It was quite exciting to think about.
 On a cliff, Zhao Xuanyuan, Chu Shiren, Zhou Mingyue, and Lu Huaxu were meditating and cultivating
 Zhou Mingyue couldn’t help but open his eyes and ask, “Grandmaster Zhao, what are we waiting for?”
 Zhao Xuanyuan was a second-generation disciple of the Hidden Sect. Zhou Mingyue was a fourth-generation disciple, so he called him Grandmaster.
 Zhao Xuanyuan said, “An old friend.”
 Chu Shiren glanced at Zhou Mingyue, scaring him so much that he shut up.
 Several hours later.
Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com A figure flew over from the horizon. It was Zhou Fan.
 Zhou Fan wore a golden-patterned purple robe and a jade crown. His temperament was extraordinary, and he was no longer a mortal.
 He landed in front of Zhao Xuanyuan and smiled. “Long time no see, Brother Zhao. I didn’t expect you to survive the calamity. Have you joined the Heavenly Race?”
 Zhao Xuanyuan smiled indifferently and said, “No, but I acknowledged a master with remarkable abilities. Our entire sect successfully avoided calamity and even obtained the providence of the Immeasurable Emperor.” Zhou Fan couldn’t help but become curious. “Who?”
 He turned to look at Chu Shiren and the other two, and his expression changed drastically.
 He asked in shock, “You’re all from the Scarlet Cloud World? Wait, do you know Han Jue?”
 Everyone who rose up from the Scarlet Cloud World was related to Han Jue.
 Including himself!
 “How dare you call my Grandmaster by his name?” Zhou Mingyue snapped unhappily.
 Although Zhou Fan looked very strong, it was impossible for him to be as strong as Zhao Xuanyuan.
 Zhao Xuanyuan also revealed a displeased expression.
 Zhou Fan looked at Zhao Xuanyuan and asked in surprise, “Is your master Han Jue?”
 Zhao Xuanyuan said coldly, “Be polite. Isn’t my master your senior, too?”
 Zhou Fan was shocked.
 Zhao Xuanyuan and Dao Sovereign both had Chaotic Physiques. He had heard the two of them mention that they had acknowledged the same master, but he had not said who it was.
 He didn’t expect it to be Han Jue!
 After Zhou Fan’s shock, he was excited.
 “How… how strong is Senior Han now?” Zhou Fan asked with a burning gaze.
 Zhao Xuanyuan saw through his thoughts and said bluntly, “Has anyone from the Providence Sect survived?”
 In other words, Han Jue was stronger than a Sage!
 Zhou Fan said, “Can you bring me to him? I’m from the same sect as him. We knew each other when we were still mortals.”
 Zhao Xuanyuan said, “Let’s talk about the Primordial Mystic Realm first. The restrictions inside are too strong. I need you to join forces with me.”
 “Alright!”
 Zhou Fan agreed readily, but his thoughts had already drifted to Han Jue.
 Another year passed.
 Han Jue came in front of the Falling Heavenly Stone. It could already move.
 It grew extremely quickly thanks to the dense Spirit Qi in the Dao Field.
 Seeing Han Jue appear, the Falling Heavenly Stone immediately hid like a crab. Han Jue was amused.
 After it hid, Han Jue appeared in front of it again, scaring it so much that it continued to hide. Han Jue let it hide first and looked for it later.
 It repeated the cycle.
 After dozens of times, the Falling Heavenly Stone became tired and stopped in front of the grass.
 Han Jue stood in front of it and asked with a smile, “Why aren’t you running anymore?”
 The Falling Heavenly Stone was silent.
 Han Jue raised his hand and pointed. A beam of light entered the Falling Heavenly Stone and helped it obtain the ability to communicate.
