 Everyone had their own fate. If there was a conflict, one would die.
 Han Jue focused on cursing Great Nine Heavens.
 It had been so long. He wondered how the situation was with this fellow.
 However, if Great Nine Heavens perished, Han Jue’s curse would fail. He would sense it, so Great Nine Heavens was still alive.
 This fellow might be stronger than Jade Emperor Zhou Yan. He wouldn’t be cursed to death so easily.
 Most importantly, this fellow had yet to travel the Immortal World, and Han Jue couldn’t lead him on.
 To all living beings, they did not know of the existence of Great Nine Heavens.
 Several days later, Han Jue put down the Book of Misfortune and continued cultivating.
 About fifty-seven years passed.
 Han Jue finally had a chance to break through.
 He released the Strange Deity and began to break through.
 Previously, the Strange Deity had helped him break through. He didn’t know if it would work this time.
 Breaking through also required time.
 After nine years, Han Jue finally broke through.
 The Dharmic powers in the Zenith Heaven Dao Fruit began to increase. Han Jue could clearly feel his body and soul transforming. This feeling was extremely wonderful.
 As he consolidated his cultivation, he checked his attributes panel.
 [Name: Han Jue]
 [Race: Primordial Fiendcelestial]
 (Cultivation: Mid-stage Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm] (Technique: Primordial Chaos Reincarnation Great Dao, Heavenly Cycle Body Tempering]
 [Great Dao: Great Dao of Life and Death, Great Dao of Karma]
 His lifespan had nearly tripled!
 Han Jue felt extremely lonely looking at this long string of nines.
 With such a long lifespan, who can pursue the Great Dao with me?
 He would give Great Nine Heavens 500 billion years of lifespan later!
 This would celebrate his breakthrough.
 500 billion years was nothing to him. Han Jue even wanted to give Great Nine Heavens a trillion years’ worth of curses.
 But he rejected this thought.
 He couldn’t act recklessly.
 Once he developed a habit, it would be troublesome.
 Moreover, Great Nine Heavens was only a potential danger and couldn’t harm him for the time being
 Three years later.
 Han Jue’s cultivation stabilized at the mid-stage Zenith Heaven Realm!
 He began to improve his various Sword Dao Mystical Powers and spent another year.
 Han Jue continued to cultivate the Grand Unity Aspect.
 The inherited memories were indeed loosened. A memory of a Mystical Power surged into Han Jue’s mind.
 The third Fiendcelestial Dharma idol.
 Wind Shaking Fiendcelestial!
 The Great Dao of Wind swept through everything!
 Every Fiendcelestial Dharma idol represented a Great Dao. However, Han Jue couldn’t directly cultivate his Great Dao through them for the time being. He could only obtain their power.
 Five years later, Han Jue completely grasped Wind Shaking Fiendcelestial. With the three Fiendcelestials combined, Han Jue felt invincible.
 Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial, Nine Yin Fiendcelestial, Wind Shaking Fiendcelestial!
 Han Jue started the simulation trial. Against the Heavenly Emperor, insta-kill! Against Li Daokong, insta-kill! Against Xue Minghe, insta-kill! Against the Demon Emperor, insta-kill! Against the Heavenly Dao Buddha, insta-kill!
 Against the Master of the Divine Palace, insta-kill!
 Killing them instantly was too satisfying.
 Once the three Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols appeared, no one else could compare to him!
 A Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal could fight for ten million rounds in a breath. The so-called insta-kill was actually not necessarily a one-hit kill.
 Apart from a few mighty figures, Han Jue could instantly kill anyone at the Zenith Heaven Realm.
 Facing an existence with unknown cultivation, Han Jue found it very difficult.
 Every Pseudo-Sage expert had their own Great Mystical Powers and Supreme Treasures. They were difficult to kill in a short period of time. The battle often lasted for more than an hour, so Han Jue couldn’t be bothered to continue.
 In his opinion, if he couldn’t defeat the enemy after an hour, it was no different from being defeated.
 If he really encountered such a situation and the enemy had an accomplice, wouldn’t he be in trouble?
 Han Jue couldn’t allow himself to encounter such a situation!
 Han Jue tried to challenge Ancestor Xitian, but he died with a roar from the latter.
 Everyone below the Sages was an ant!
 Han Jue didn’t become upset. He occasionally tested himself against such extraordinary powers to raise his alertness.
 Then, he took out the Book of Misfortune and started cursing Great Nine Heavens.
 Heavenly Court, Imperial Garden.
 Great Nine Heavens and Fang Liang were discussing the calamity in the pavilion when his expression suddenly changed. Fang Liang asked, “What’s wrong?” Great Nine Heavens said, “Nothing.”
 He didn’t dare to say that he was being cursed by the Dark Forbidden Lord. If that was the case, how could he persuade Fang Liang?
 Several days later.
 Great Nine Heavens was in his room. He circulated his energy to heal his injuries, but the Dark Forbidden Lord’s curse was becoming stronger and stronger. “Why has this fellow’s curse power become stronger again?” Great Nine Heavens frowned. The uneasiness in his heart intensified.
 In the past, the Dark Forbidden Lord had only cursed for five days. This time, it came menacingly and had already lasted for more than five days.
 The thought of Jade Emperor Zhou Yan’s miserable outcome made him even more uneasy.
 No!
 He couldn’t wait for death!
 Great Nine Heavens immediately jumped out of the ninth heaven and flew towards the 33rd Heaven.
 Boom
 Great Nine Heavens suddenly spat out blood from his seven orifices. This blood was formed by his Dharmic powers, causing his essence to be greatly damaged.
 “Oh no! I have to hurry up!” Great Nine Heavens’ expression changed drastically as he hurriedly penetrated the layers of Heavenly Dao restrictions.
 Inside the Connate Cave Abode.
 Han Jue saw that his lifespan had been deducted by 300 billion years and couldn’t help but stop.
 “No, I can’t curse blindly like this.”
 Han Jue decided to give Great Nine Heavens a dream and let him develop hatred. Only then would he know his exact situation.
 Soon, the two of them entered the dream realm.
 The pale Great Nine Heavens saw the black shadow in front of him, and his expression instantly darkened.
 Dark Forbidden Lord?!
 Upon seeing the other party’s appearance, he immediately guessed his identity.
 He looked around and discovered that this was a dream.
 “What Mystical Power is this? I didn’t sense it before and was forcefully pulled in…”
 Great Nine Heavens was terrified.
 From the looks of it, the Dark Forbidden Lord was definitely stronger than him.
 He had to eliminate him!
 (Great Nine Heavens has developed hatred towards you. Current Hatred Points: 5 stars]
 Han Jue immediately ended the dream when he saw this line of words.
 In a huge palace.
 Great Nine Heavens suddenly woke up.
 A figure sat in front of him. His entire body was glowing with a strong light, making it impossible to see his true appearance.
 “What happened just now? Why were you lost in thought?” the strong figure asked.
 Great Nine Heavens replied, “The Dark Forbidden Lord visited me in my dreams…”
 Wait!
 Did the Sage not notice this just now?
Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m The reason why the Dark Forbidden Lord directly removed the dream was that he sensed a Sage beside him? In an instant, Great Nine Heavens trembled. What kind of terrifying existence had he provoked?
 Could it be that the Dark Forbidden Lord was a Sage?
 The reason why he did not dare to show himself was not because he was afraid of attracting endless trouble, but because it would damage his dignity?
 The more Great Nine Heavens thought about it, the more panicked he became.
 “Oh? Dream visit?” The strong figure began to deduce with his fingers. The dream just now was too short and the two of them didn’t communicate earlier, so the strong figure didn’t capture Han Jue’s Mystical Power.
 He couldn’t deduce anything now.
 He didn’t suspect that Great Nine Heavens was lying.
 Thus, it could only mean one thing.
 The Dark Forbidden Lord was very strong!
 “Which Sage is secretly plotting something?” The strong figure muttered.
 Great Nine Heavens was almost scared out of his wits.
 He was really a Sage!
 Great Nine Heavens panicked when he thought of the terrifying scene of the Dark Forbidden Lord cursing him.
