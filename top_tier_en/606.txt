 Unfortunately, Han Jue was already stronger than the Dark Sage King! However, he didn’t want to become a thorn in the side of the existence behind the Dark Sage King. He had to pull other factions along. It was best to reduce his presence in this battle.
 “After you consider it carefully, inform me at any time. The Dark Sage King must be eliminated. At that time, we Sages will go to the Dark Forbidden Zone together,” Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said in a low voice.
 Han Jue nodded and canceled the dream.
 He opened his eyes and asked in his mind, “Did Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du lie to me just now?”
 (4 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 (No]
 Han Jue’s expression softened.
 Qiu Xilai and Heavenly Venerate Wufa had already been enslaved by the Primordial Heavenly Prison. If the Sages had any schemes, they would naturally tell him.
 Han Jue was still worried.
 He suddenly had a bold thought.
 Should he enslave all the Sages other than Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du?
 No.
 Too risky.
 Back then, enslaving Qiu Xilai had offended Cundi and all the big shots in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End. It was not beneficial for this trip.
 Han Jue adjusted his state of mind and started to increase his strength.
 The Grand Unity Aspect was necessary. Every Dharma Idol he cultivated could increase his strength.
 A hundred years passed.
 Han Jue’s cultivation and strength had been raised to the limit, but he had only mastered 25 new Dharma Idols.
 Compared to his previous breakthrough, it was much worse.
 Han Jue felt an unseen force suppressing his cultivation of the Grand Unity Aspect.
 The new Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols he had cultivated were the Danger Fiendcelestial, the Dark Chaotic Fiendcelestial, the Order Fiendcelestial, the Enlightened Fiendcelestial, the Barefoot Fiendcelestial, the Mad Flow Fiendcelestial, the Lawful Fiendcelestial, the Fulfilling Dream Fiendcelestial, the Great Compassion Fiendcelestial, the Clear Void Fiendcelestial, the Evil Purification Fiendcelestial, the Righteous Fiendcelestial, the Spirit Severing Fiendcelestial, the Dao Merit Fiendcelestial, the Three Body Fiendcelestial, the Heaven Crushing Fiendcelestial, the Unparalleled Fiendcelestial, the Weakness Fiendcelestial, the Defiance Fiendcelestial, the Great Night Fiendcelestial, the Black Hole Fiendcelestial, the Destruction Fiendcelestial, the Six-Eared Fiendcelestial, the Great Mystical Power Fiendcelestial, and the Seven-Colored Fiendcelestial.
 Han Jue began the simulation trial and first fought Li Zizai.
 A total of 249 Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols appeared and killed Li Zizai in three breaths of time.
 Han Jue continued the simulation trial.
 After hundreds of times, he discovered that he couldn’t erase Li Zizai.
 The power of freedom was too powerful and could protect his soul.
 Li Zizai’s Great Dao was illusory and very powerful. However, it was not the Fiendcelestial Dharma Idol’s match.
 Han Jue began to try not to use the Grand Unity Aspect to fight. He used his Dharma treasure. He used the Primordial Judgment Sword in his right hand and the Killing Dao Token in his left. He used all his defensive Supreme Treasures and fought with his Mystical Powers.
 An hour later, he killed Li Zizai.
 Not enough!
 Continue!
 Several years later.
 Han Jue’s combat experience increased greatly. Without relying on the Grand Unity Aspect, he needed at least thirty breaths of time to kill Li Zizai.
 It had to be said that in terms of explosive power, the Grand Unity Aspect was the most ferocious.
 Han Jue checked the emails.
 (Your good friend Evil Heavenly Emperor received a lecture from a mysterious mighty figure. His cultivation has increased greatly.]
 (Your good friend Yang Du was attacked by a mysterious race] x1209328
 (Your son Han Tuo fled the Dark Falling Prison.)
 (Your good friend Liu Bei was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure and was severely injured.]
 (Your good friend Shi Dudao was attacked by your good friend Li Daokong.)
 (Your good friend Jiang Dugu has released your good friend Primordial Yuan Phoenix.]
 (Your son Han Tuo has entered the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End.)
 Han Jue was stunned.
 Why did Han Tuo escape?
 He was already prepared to take the risk to save him.
 He pinched his fingers to deduce. After leaving the Dark Falling Prison, he could capture Han Tuo’s karma and deduce his situation. However, it involved the Dark Falling Prison. He still could not guess what had happened previously.
 “Is Han Tuo being watched by the Dark Sage King?” Han Jue asked in his mind.
 [Ten billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 Ten billion was nothing! [Not for the time being.]
 Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief when he saw these words.
 Thinking about it carefully, it was normal. The Dark Sage King didn’t know him at all. Han Jue’s son naturally didn’t catch his eye.
 Capturing Han Tuo should be a coincidence. Since he was fine, Han Jue didn’t take the risk.
 The matter of dealing with the Dark Sage King was pushed back.
 He had previously calculated that the Dark Sage King would take billions of years to enter the Heavenly Dao. It was still very early to deal with him.
 After billions of years, Han Jue was confident that he could surpass the Great Dao!
 If the Dark Sage King could surpass Ancestor Xitian, how could he let him act recklessly?
 In the end, although the Dark Sage King was strong, he was inferior to a Transcendent Dao Expert and a Great Dao Divine Spirit. He was still a pawn.
 Han Jue completely relaxed. He could finally look away.
 After twenty thousand years, Murong Qi had already transformed.
 Han Jue teleported to the second Dao Field and let him out.
 Murong Qi opened his eyes and discovered that he was not in the Hundred Peak Immortal River. He couldn’t help but be stunned.
 Then, he became excited.
 He could feel that his physical strength far exceeded before!
 This sort of potential that could be seen with the naked eye was too satisfying. He finally understood why mighty figures valued juniors’ potential the most.
Diisscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com Potential was too important!
 Murong Qi knelt in front of him and kept kowtowing.
 Han Jue said, “From today onwards, you will stay here. Do you know what your body is?”
 Murong Qi looked up and asked, “What?”
 “Chaotic Fiendcelestial.”
 Murong Qi’s eyes widened. He had heard of the legend of the Chaotic Fiendcelestial.
 Could the mysterious power surging in his body be the legendary Great Dao power? Han Jue said, “In the future, I will create even more Chaotic Fiendcelestials. All of them will cultivate here and leave after reaching the Primordial Chaos Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm. I want you to lead the Chaotic Fiendcelestials. Are you willing?”
 More?
 Murong Qi was shocked, and his breathing quickened.
 “I won’t let you down!”
 “Yes, I’ve already isolated you from the Myriad Worlds Projection. You can stay here in peace from now on.”
 “Yes!”
 Murong Qi wasn’t stupid. Han Jue wanted to nurture a force that even the Hidden Sect did not know.
 He was filled with admiration. As expected of Grandmaster, he kept creating trump cards. After the Hidden Sect became stronger, there would indeed be unstable elements. Back then, the Dao Sect ruled the world, but they still broke up under the eyes of the Dao Ancestor.
 In addition, the Chaotic Fiendcelestial didn’t have a Chaotic Physique, so it was inferior to the Chaotic Domain. The so-called Chaotic Domain was only created by the Heavenly Dao. The Chaotic Physique was not at the level of the Chaotic Fiendcelestial’s potential.
 Han Jue waved his hand and created a Daoist temple before entering.
 Murong Qi did not disturb him. Instead, he wandered around. He had left Hidden Sect Island for 100,000 years. After being reborn, he had returned to his hometown and had a different mood.
 Han Jue took out the Creation Spirit Stone.
 The Creation Spirit Stone was as big as a human head and emitted a seven-colored light. It was extremely dazzling.
 He began to think about which Chaotic Fiendcelestial he would create.
 His first choice was the Strength Fiendcelestial, but the legendary Strength Fiendcelestial was Pangu. He was afraid that Pangu’s image would attract too much trouble.
 He might as well choose a less influential Fiendcelestial to create first.
 In any case, there would be more Creation Spirit Stones in the future.
