 Han Jue’s OCD made him wake up on time after a thousand years, which meant that another thousand years had passed. He was immersed in the Great Dao of Extreme Origin and could not extricate himself.
T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by nov(ê(l)biin.co/m Although he had created the Great Dao of Extreme Origin and had been comprehending it, he could only sense its power when he truly fused with it.
 It was a power that far exceeded the Heavenly Dao Sage Realm!
 He was not restricted by any rules. Even the Heavenly Dao and Great Dao could not restrain him. This was the Freedom Sage Realm!
 Han Jue had already grasped the basics and stepped into the process of fusing with the Great Dao of Extreme Origin.
 However, he couldn’t estimate how long it would take for him to become a Freedom Sage.
 This process might take a long time. After all, it was not a minor realm.
 Han Jue teleported from the second Dao Field to the Hundred Peak Immortal River. He walked around the Fusang Tree and observed his disciples.
 Half a day later, he returned to the second Dao Field and continued his Dao Integration.
 He did this to prevent the disciples from thinking that he had already left and give the other Sages a chance to fan the flames.
 The Dao Field could block Sages, but it couldn’t block their dreams.
 Han Jue quickly immersed himself in the Dao Integration and forgot everything.
 In the darkness, countless meteors surrounded each other. In the center was a stone island. A black pillar of light with an unknown height on the island connected to the darkness.
 In front of the black pillar of light, Li Zizai knelt on the ground.
 Upon a careful look, a burly figure sitting could be seen seated on a stone chair in the pillar of light. The outline of the figure emitted a great pressure that was terrifying.
 Kneeling in front of this figure, Li Zizai did not even dare to look up. “This Great Dao is mysterious. Stop staring at it. Many old fellows watching in the depths of the Chaos. You don’t have a chance.”
 A hoarse voice sounded.
 Li Zizai frowned and said in a low voice, “I understand.”
 The hoarse voice added, “There’s chaos in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End. The Dao Devils are wreaking havoc. Go back and investigate. I suspect there’s a conspiracy behind it.
 “Ever since Pangu created the world, countless eras have passed. Be it the Heavenly Dao or the Great Dao, they can’t completely occupy the Chaos. This is not good.”
 Li Zizai looked up. “What do you think of the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End?”
 “The Deity Realm of the Ruins of End cannot be destroyed.”
 “The Heavenly Dao World has been shrinking. Once the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End is destroyed, the Heavenly Dao will sooner or later be devoured by the Chaotic Faction. Everything Pangu has done will be in vain. The former Chaotic Darkness will return and we will all perish.”
 “Who is in the Chaotic Faction? I only know the Chaotic Deity.” “You will understand when you transcend the illusion.”
 In the black light, the burly figure slowly stood up.
 Li Zizai looked up.
 The ghost mist figure said, “Find the Primordial Fiendcelestial. The Chaotic forces are looking for him. We have to find him first.”
 With that, the black pillar of light shrank and vanished.
 Li Zizai turned around and left.
 Time passed.
 Year after year passed.
 Ten thousand years passed in the blink of an eye. When Han Jue reached 110,000 years old, he didn’t encounter any system choices. It would probably only be triggered once every 100,000 years. Thinking back, a long time ago, he had triggered the system choice once at the age of ten.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and heaved a sigh of relief.
 His body was still filled with divine light, but it was no longer the light of the Sun and Moon Yin-Yang Protection, but the light of the Great Dao.
 The fusion process was already halfway through. There was nothing unusual on the surface of the Great Dao of Extreme Origin, but in fact, it was almost replaced by Han Jue.
 In at most ten thousand years, Han Jue would become a Freedom Sage and be outside the Heavenly Dao.
 Han Jue took the time to check his emails.

 (Your good friend Qiu Xilai was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure and was severely injured. His Dao heart was damaged.]
 (Your good friend Emperor Xiao…)
 Why was Li Daokong attacked by the Heavenly Dao?
 Could it be that the Heavenly Dao Spirit had already possessed the living beings of the Immortal World?
 The number of times Yang Du was attacked was really exaggerated. After the dream ended back then, Yang Du developed a favorable impression of him. As time passed, his favorability kept increasing. Now, it had already increased to 5.5 stars.
 It was probably related to his experience.
 Han Jue noticed that the Sages were attacked by a mysterious mighty figure. Looking down, all the Sages were attacked by a mysterious mighty figure and were severely injured. Could it be that they were all attacked by the same enemy? Dark Sage King!
 Han Jue could only think of this person.
 In short, his friends were doing well. No one had died.
 After the calamity ended, other than the million disciples of the Hundred Peak Immortal River, all the living beings in the myriad worlds had never seen him. Therefore, Han Jue’s circle of friends was still very strong. All of them were experts who dominated an area, and it was very difficult for them to die.
 Han Jue thought for a moment and sent a dream to Immortal Emperor Samsara.
 The dream began.
 Immortal Emperor Samsara was quite excited when he saw Han Jue. He immediately knelt down and bowed.
 “Master, you’re finally looking for me!”
 “Have you encountered trouble recently?”
 targeted by the Infinite Space. The Infinite Space also has the backing of a Sage. The Sage of the Human School told us to avoid him and not fight with him. However, the Infinite Space has always been targeting us.”
 Han Jue raised his eyebrows.
 Infinite Space… The Reincarnation Space’s form was imitated by some mighty figures in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End, so they were not surprised.
 However, the Infinite Space was blocking his way. He had to think of a way to resolve this issue.
 Han Jue asked, “Who is the Sage behind the Infinite Space?”
 Immortal Emperor Samsara said helplessly, “I don’t know.”
 He was a high and mighty existence in the Reincarnation Space, but in front of a Sage, he was only a pawn.
 The pawns couldn’t see the situation outside the chessboard.
 Han Jue said, “What about the Reincarnation Space’s interior? How’s the development?”
 “More than a million Reincarnators have already reached the Immortal Realm. It’s not bad. Earth is worthy of being the inheritance of the Earth Immortal World. We chose many outstanding Reincarnators from the River of Time. Some Reincarnators were born with the providence of the Human Emperor. After stepping into cultivation, they were unstoppable. For example, Di Xin, Ying Zheng, Han Wudi, Li Shimin, Zhao Kuangyin, and so on.”
 Immortal Emperor Samsara began to talk about the development of the Reincarnation Space.
 Han Jue wasn’t surprised that the Emperor of Han and the other Emperors had the providence of the Human Emperor or.
 The providence of the Human Emperor was not worth much. Even Xing Hongxuan had it.
 After all, it was only the providence of a race, let alone the fact that the humans were no longer part of the Heavenly Dao Race.
 From Immortal Emperor Samsara, Han Jue learned that Yang Du was already one of the top existences in the Reincarnation Space. He was the most favored Reincarnator among the twelve Overgods under Immortal Emperor Samsara.
 The reason why he was not the first was that the Human School had also nurtured a powerful Reincarnator. They had fought with Yang Du many times and both sides had wins and losses. In short, they were on par.
 Han Jue suddenly asked, “When does the Reincarnation Space control the Earth Immortal World?”
 Immortal Emperor Samsara said, “There are no longer any races in the Earth Immortal World that can threaten us. It’s just that the Sage of the Human School wants us to slow down. He’s afraid of alerting the mysterious Chaotic Fiendcelestial behind the science and even more afraid of alerting the Ancestor of the Earth Immortal World, Zhen Yuanzi.”
