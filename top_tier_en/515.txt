 In the hall, Han Jue, Han Tuo, and Qingluan’er were eating and celebrating Han Tuo’s birthday.
 Han Tuo was very happy. It was unknown if it was because of his birthday or something else, but his face was flushed with excitement.
 Qingluan’er put food into Han Jue’s bowl. He held his wine cup and asked about Han Tuo’s recent homework.
 The current Human Race already had an education structure. They could study and obtain fame.
 Han Tuo replied truthfully. Han Jue could clearly see that his mind was not on this.
 “Father, when is your birthday?” Han Tuo suddenly changed the topic.
 Han Jue said, “I don’t remember anymore.”
 “Why can’t you remember? Where are your parents? They’re my grandpa and grandma.”
 “I was born without parents.”
 “Huh?”
 Han Tuo was stunned. He suddenly realized that he had never cared about his father since he was young. He only wanted to cultivate.
 Qingluan’er chuckled. “Look at how hard your father had lived growing up. You have to be filial to him when you grow up.”
 Han Tuo nodded and said proudly, “I will become a cultivator in the future and live forever. I will let you live forever together!”
 “Tuo’er is really ambitious.”
 Qingluan’er rubbed Han Tuo’s head with a benevolent expression.
 Han Jue drank his wine and smiled at the mother and son.
 Needless to say, after cultivating bitterly for thirty thousand years, it was quite good to experience such a mortal life. It had a different feeling.
 However, the lives of mortals were filled with uncertainty. They were not like cultivators who could control their lives.
 Three years later, Han Tuo reached the age of sixteen.
 Eastern Guard City welcomed danger again. An unprecedented beast tide attacked. The neighboring cities had already fallen. Rumors spread, causing everyone to panic.
 The City Lord began to forcefully recruit soldiers. Male children older than 15 years old had to join the army, and Han Tuo also went.
 Snow fell again and covered the sky. The entire city was covered in white.
 Han Jue came to the inn. This was the first inn he had come to in Eastern Guard City. He usually liked to come here.
 It was still the same old spot. It was by the window on the second floor, allowing him to see people coming and going in the street.
 Compared to before, the streets of the city were much less crowded, most of them in a
 hurry.
 “Young friend, long time no see. Your hair has also turned white. Time truly does not spare anyone.”
 A laugh sounded, and the old Daoist who Han Jue met when he first came to the Eastern Guard City walked over. He still sat in front of him.
 After so many years, Han Jue deliberately let a few strands of white hair appear on his head. Although he was still handsome, he was no longer young
 Han Jue smiled. “Senior, you’re still as white-haired as ever.”
 The old Daoist smiled. “Same old rules?”
 Han Jue nodded slightly. The old Daoist poured himself a cup of wine and smiled. “Young friend, you shouldn’t be an ordinary person. Your bearing isn’t like that of a mortal. Even though the city is about to be destroyed, you’re still as calm as ever. Could it be that you’re here to transcend mortality?”
 Han Jue asked, “What about you?”
 “I’m also a Transcendent Mortal. I travel the world and cultivate my state of mind.”
 “What realm are you at?”
 “Deity Transcendence. You should be undergoing Immortal Transcendence, right? We are fated. In the future, you can come to my Heavenly Gate and pursue the Great Dao.’
 The old Daoist pinched his beard and smiled proudly.
 Han Jue thanked him indifferently.
 The two of them started chatting.
 As they chatted, the roars of ferocious beasts came from outside the city. It was deafening.
 The people on the street below fled in fear. Han Jue and the old Daoist were still drinking and chatting about their experiences traveling the world.
 (Chen Yazi has a favorable impression of you. Current favorability: 3 stars]
 Han Jue did not care about this notification.
 After a long time. Chen Yazi stood up to leave. He said, “Life is filled with shackles. If you want to break free from them, you have to have no desires.”
 His words made Han Jue emotional.
 No desires!
 This was the realm that ordinary immortals wanted to reach. They wanted to stay away from karma.
 Han Jue was only enlightened but not moved.
 His Dao was not without desires. On the contrary, he had desires, he had wants!
 He wanted to live forever, he desired immortality!
 In order to pursue what he wanted, he would have a stronger motivation to cultivate.
 This was also the life of many mortals.
 This was not bad.
 “I’ve been avoiding the world for so long. Isn’t it to be the strongest? After reaching the strongest, I can do whatever I want?”
 Han Jue’s gaze landed on the panicked people downstairs again. He had a deeper understanding of his Dao, and it was gradually becoming firmer.
 After being in the mortal world for so many years, he had seen everything mortals should experience. Life, death, love, hatred, and parting with life.
 Every mortal pursued the control of their life.
 Han Jue was already a Pseudo-Sage and was still pursuing this Dao heart.
 When he became a Sage, he would do as he pleased!
 Han Jue’s eyes became firm.
 This is my Sage Dao, I desire, I want!
 Han Jue entered a meditation state and began to comprehend the Great Dao of Extreme Origin.
 He wasn’t afraid of being disturbed. Not to mention the surrounding mortals, even if the ferocious beasts outside the city attacked, they wouldn’t be able to hurt him.
 The calamity of defending the city lasted longer than before. The battle was cruel and endless.
 Two years later.
 Han Jue stood in the courtyard, bathing in the snow.
 His Dao Fruit began to transform.
 It was transforming towards the Sage Dao Fruit!
 Perhaps because his Dao heart was firm, Han Jue’s Dharmic powers that had not increased for a long time began to increase again.
 The breakthrough was coming!
 Han Jue started to hesitate if he should go back.
 He had a feeling that he would break through in at most a hundred years.
 However, when he thought of Qingluan’er and Han Tuo, Han Jue’s heart softened. He decided to accompany them until the end.
 Han Jue had changed his mind about Han Tuo already.
 Previously, he had wanted to suppress Han Tuo’s bloodline because he was afraid that he would cause trouble for him and create a large amount of karma.
 Now, Han Jue had thought it through.
 Excessive worry was a shackle and an obstacle!
 Han Jue showed a carefree smile.
 [Empress Houtu sent you a dream. Do you accept?]
 A line of words suddenly appeared in front of him. He asked silently, “Is it dangerous to accept?”
 (3 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels [No]
 Han Jue immediately decided to accept it.
 Desires and wants didn’t mean recklessness.
 It was always good to be cautious, especially when the other party might threaten his life.
 In the dream, by the Yellow Spring.
 Han Jue cupped his hands and bowed.
 Empress Houtu said, “The Heavenly Devils are coming. Killing them awards merit. If the Hidden Sect wants to become a providence sect, don’t miss it.”
 Han Jue smiled and said, “Thank you for your reminder, Empress. Is the netherworld preparing to besiege the Heavenly Devils?” “Yes, we can capture the Heavenly Devils to be ghost servants. Although these Heavenly Devils are violent, they are not scheming. In a sense, they are not terrifying.”
 “Where did the Heavenly Devils come from?”
 “The actions of the Devil Race’s Sages can be considered to be acting in coordination with the Heavenly Dao. Through the Heavenly Devil Calamity, a large number of people with great providence will appear. After that, it will probably be the battle for the Sage position.”
 Empress Houtu revealed a worried expression as she continued, “No one in the netherworld is qualified to fight for the Sage position. I hope that you can obtain it. If you are afraid of trouble, you can at least let the Hidden Sect obtain it. Regardless of whether the Dao Sect obtains it or the other Sages obtain it, it will break the balance that has lasted for a long time.”
 Han Jue raised his eyebrows.
 He held the Great Dao Purple Qi and the Primordial Purple Qi in his hands. They were enough to nurture two Sages.
 If he fought for another one…
 Apart from him, wouldn’t the Hidden Sect have three more Sages?
 I’m not fighting, but you guys came knocking on my door?
