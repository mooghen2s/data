 Fang Liang, oh Fang Liang, I’ve paved so many paths for you. If you insist on going down the wrong path, I have no choice but to forcefully correct you!
 Han Jue closed his eyes and started cultivating.
 Fang Liang’s disappearance was not suspected by the Sages. They even hoped that he would suddenly die.
 Several hundred years later. Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du’s voice resounded through the world. “The battle between the Heavenly Dao and the Calamity Race will stop for the time being. The Calamity Race will give up half of the netherworld and protect the Heavenly Dao together with us.”
 Boom
 The myriad worlds and the Immortal World were in an uproar.
 After fighting for so long, they had actually stopped! Furthermore, the Calamity Race had taken the initiative to give up half the netherworld! News of the battle in the netherworld had always spread to the myriad worlds. Panic and tension had always enveloped the entire Heavenly Dao.
 They never expected the Sages to suddenly announce that the war would stop. It wasn’t only the living beings of the Heavenly Dao who were puzzled. The Calamity Race was the same.
 The two sides had been fighting for a long time. The blood feud was very difficult to resolve. The conflict within the Calamity Race had also completely erupted. Unlike the Heavenly Dao, the Calamity Race invaded with their entire race. Almost every living being had relatives and friends who died in the netherworld. They said they weren’t going to fight anymore! How could they avenge themselves? All the higher-ups of the Calamity Race went to visit the Heavenly Calamity Emperor. Hundreds of generals gathered in the palace and stared at Heavenly Calamity Emperor angrily. Heavenly Calamity Emperor was expressionless. “You want to rebel?” With that said, all the generals knelt down and said that they did not dare. An old man looked up and asked, “Your Majesty, why did you suddenly make such a decision?” Heavenly Calamity Emperor said, “The Calamity Race pursues the future, not being a knife for the Great Dao Sage. Don’t worry, I won’t harm the Calamity Race.”
 The Calamity Race generals looked at each other, still dissatisfied.
 What kind of explanation was this?
 The Heavenly Calamity Emperor waved her hand, and the generals had no choice but to retreat. When only Heavenly Calamity Emperor was left in the hall, she said, “How long more do you want to watch, Divine Lord?” Divine Lord Peacock walked out of the darkness. He frowned and asked, “What is this? I’m here to play with your Calamity Race?” He had come all the way here and stayed for thousands of years. In the end, before he could even encounter the Dark Forbidden Lord, the Calamity Race had already surrendered? The Heavenly Calamity Emperor said, “Sorry, but do you really trust the Great Dao Sage?” Divine Lord Peacock narrowed his eyes. “Who subdued you?” The Heavenly Calamity Emperor did not answer. Divine Lord Peacock was frustrated. No one would be happy that their plan had been disrupted. However, he didn’t care to attack the Heavenly Calamity Emperor. The one who invited him was the Heavenly Lord of Primordial Beginning, not the Heavenly Calamity Emperor.
 “Divine Lord, actually, joining the Heavenly Dao is not impossible. The current Heavenly Dao is no longer the previous Heavenly Dao,” the Heavenly Calamity Emperor said meaningfully. Divine Lord Peacock looked at her deeply before turning around and disappearing into the darkness.
 The Heavenly Calamity Emperor did not care and closed her eyes to cultivate. If Divine Lord Peacock wanted to kill her, it would be useless even if she tried her best to guard against him.
 1,400 years passed. (Primordial Heavenly Prison has successfully enslaved the target.) [Fang Liang has a favorable impression of you. Current favorability: Max] Han Jue opened his eyes and looked at Fang Liang, who had also opened his eyes.

He didn’t want to throw the people around him into the Primordial Heavenly Prison, but Fang Liang had already become a demon and insisted on sacrificing himself for the Dao Ancestor. Han Jue asked, “Are you still going to undergo Dao Integration?” “I’ll listen to Grandmaster’s arrangements.” “Then don’t do it.”
 “Yes.”
 Looking at Fang Liang acting like a robot, Han Jue sighed. However, he did not trigger the Dao Ancestor’s hatred notification. It seemed that the Dao Ancestor did not keep tabs on Fang Liang. Perhaps the Dao Ancestor was in danger, or he had many pawns like Fang Liang. Han Jue asked, “Did the Dao Ancestor ask you to fuse with the Dao?” Fang Liang shook his head and nodded. “I’m not sure, either. Now that I think about it, my desire to fuse with the Dao is very crazy. There’s no motive or reason.”
 Fang Liang had been alone since he was young. After becoming Han Jue’s disciple, although he had encountered many dangers, he had always survived.
 Throughout his life, he had been sad and happy, but not bitter and vengeful.
 The more Fang Liang thought about it, the more confused he became.
 What was wrong with him?
 He had a deep fear of the Dao Ancestor. Unknowingly, he had become like this. Han Jue said, “Go back. Like before, continue to protect the Heavenly Dao, but don’t undergo Dao Integration. Don’t tell anyone what happened between us during this period of time.”
 “Understood.”
 Fang Liang stood up and bowed. Han Jue waved his sleeve and sent him out.
 After that, he stretched. “I’m saving the Heavenly Dao and the Sages’ future again.” Han Jue felt that he was so noble. He was saving everything behind the scenes. He looked at the myriad worlds of the Heavenly
 Dao.
 After so many years, the battle had long ended. The Calamity Race, the Heavenly Race, and the Ghost Deities had divided their territory in the netherworld. Empress Houtu, Ji Xianshen, Yang Tiandong, and Su Qi had returned to their positions and were working hard to restore the order of reincarnation. Too many ghosts were wandering outside the netherworld. It was impossible to completely clean them up in a short period of time. In short, peace descended again. Han Jue suddenly thought of Divine Lord Peacock. This fellow was still in the city of the Calamity Race and had no intention of leaving.
 The Calamity Race had already surrendered. What else did this fellow want? Han Jue decided to visit Divine Lord Peacock in the image of the Dark Forbidden Lord. The dream was still above the Yellow Spring. Divine Lord Peacock opened his eyes. He was not surprised to see him. He asked, “Dark Forbidden Lord, when are you going to attack me?” Han Jue asked, “Why should I swing my saber at you? If I wanted to kill someone, I wouldn’t have contacted them like this and directly attacked.” “Oh? Then what do you mean?” “Join me and become my believer. I will lead you to an unprecedented peak. I think very highly of your potential and strength. I think so highly of you that I don’t want to kill you. Under my guidance, I will let you surpass the Chaotic Deity or even the Dao Ancestor!” Han Jue spoke firmly as if he was telling the truth. Divine Lord Peacock said disdainfully, “You want to subdue me with nonsense? It’s still the same thing. If you want me to be convinced, you have to defeat me. The difference in cultivation level is only a shackle in my opinion. It can be breached. Perhaps your cultivation level surpasses mine, but I might not lose.”
 How pretentious.
 This fellow was definitely the most confident person he had ever met.
 Han Jue asked, “Then, do you mean that you are invincible in the same realm?” Divine Lord Peacock said proudly, “That’s right!” “What if I send a disciple of the same realm as you to defeat you?” “Impossible!”
