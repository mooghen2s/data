 But he thought of Han Jue’s words. This was a trap.
 Su Qi looked up and saw a huge figure appear at the end of the world. These figures were at least at the Deity Realm.
 At this moment, Su Qi felt sorrow.
 Others would always fight in groups, but he would always be alone, be it for himself or for the Heavenly Court.
 Su Qi thought of the Invocation Technique. He could ask Han Jue for help.
 Although he didn’t care about them, he believed that if he used the Invocation Technique, Han Jue would definitely help.
 No!
 How can I have such thoughts? Master has already helped me a lot. How can I drag him into the calamity?
 Su Qi’s eyes became even more ruthless.
 Since that was the case, he could only risk it!
 At most, he would die!
 I’ve lived enough in this life!
 Su Qi raised his right hand and laughed wildly. “Today, I want to see who can kill me!”
𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com With that said, all the living beings in the world flew into a rage and charged at him.
 The scene froze. Su Qi, who was surrounded by all living beings, was so tiny. He was like a piece of rubble in the forest, and he would be drowned by all living beings in the next moment.
 In the blink of an eye, another forty years had passed since he had killed Wu Dao.
 On this day, Han Jue was uneasy.
 He was a Zenith Heaven cultivator and would not develop emotions for no reason. Something must have happened.
 He immediately checked the emails.
 (Your disciple Su Qi used the Dao Destruction Mystical Power. His providence has fallen greatly.)
 (Your good friend Mo Fuchou was attacked by a mysterious force and died.]
 (Your good friend Shu Jinxing was attacked by a mysterious force and died.]
 (Your good friend Xuan Qingjun was attacked by a mysterious force. Fortunately, the providence of the Heavenly Race protected her.]
 (Your good friend Flame Lord Emperor was attacked by a mysterious force and died.)
 (Your good friend Huang Zuntian was attacked by a mysterious force. Fortunately, the providence of the Heavenly Race protected him.]
 (Your good friend Han Ming was attacked by a mysterious force and died.)
 (Your good friend Han Ming obtained the help of a Sage and was revived with the last trace of his soul.]
 As he watched, many died!
 Everyone in the Heavenly Court was about to die.
 Han Jue frowned. Why was Su Qi still using the Dao Destruction Mystical Power?
 Han Jue asked, “How many living beings have died because of Su Qi?”
 (A billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 (90% of the living beings were wiped out. The exact number is immeasurable.]
 Han Jue remained silent.
 So many!
 Han Jue checked Su Qi’s cultivation. It was at the Rank One Immortal Emperor Realm, but after using the Dao Destruction Mystical Power, it would decrease by a major realm. In other words, Su Qi had already reached the Deity Realm.
 Too ruthless.
 Was this the Dao Destruction Mystical Power?
 If a Sage used it, wouldn’t all the living beings in the Heavenly Dao die?
 (Qiu Xilai wants to visit you in your dreams. Do you accept?]
 (Qiu Xilai wants to visit you in your dreams. Do you accept?]
 (Qiu Xilai wants to visit you in your dreams. Do you accept?]
 This fellow was too impatient.
 Accept!
 Han Jue’s consciousness entered the dream.
 It was still the familiar hall and the familiar Golden Buddha.
 Qiu Xilai said in a low voice, “Your disciple Su Qi used the Dao Destruction Mystical Power to slaughter all living beings and forcefully ended the Immeasurable Calamity.”
 Shocked, Han Jue asked, “Dao Destruction Mystical Power? What is that? How can he be so capable?”
 He became more and more terrified. As if he had heard some amazing news.
 “How great of a sin is this…” Han Jue muttered to himself. Regardless of whether Qiu Xilai believed this act or not, he convinced himself that he didn’t know about this at all.
 Qiu Xilai sighed. “It’s not only the Immortal World. The other mortal worlds are the same. They’re deathly silent. Your disciple is doomed. I can’t save him, either.”
 Han Jue showed a frown.
 Qiu Xilai changed the topic. “He has to die. Otherwise, it will be difficult to appease the anger of the other Sages, and we won’t be able to give the Heavenly Dao an explanation. I can only help him leave behind a trace of his remnant soul. I’ll hand him to you in the future. From now on, he’s not allowed to appear within the Heavenly Dao. Otherwise, his body and soul will be destroyed.”
 Han Jue knew that this was the best outcome.
 He hurriedly thanked Qiu Xilai and asked curiously, “Where did my disciple learn such a powerful Mystical Power?”
 Qiu Xilai sighed. “The Dao Destruction Mystical Power was passed down by the Dao Ancestor to the Sages. I believe that your disciple was also used by a Sage. As for who it is, I can’t tell you for the time being. You can’t withstand the karma of the Sages. I’m doing this for your own good.”
 Han Jue was silent.
 It seemed that Qiu Xilai might be on the same side as Sage Fated Secrets.
 He would derive it after returning.
 In any case, he didn’t completely trust Qiu Xilai and Nüwa. It was just that he was not strong enough and could only pretend to trust them.
 “The calamity is considered to have ended. In ten years, the Sages will disperse the negative karma of the world. After that, you can return to the Immortal World at any time.”
 Han Jue asked, “When can the Immortal World be filled with living beings?”
 Qiu Xilai said, “In the nurturing of the world, all kinds of living beings will eventually be born. You can also use this opportunity to preach and establish a sect. Ten million years later, you will be a mighty figure respected by all living beings in the world, just like the past Buddha, the Heavenly Emperor, and the Demon Emperor.”
 Han Jue sighed.
 Immeasurable Calamity, Death Calamity!
 Only a few people could escape this calamity!
 Living beings cultivated in peace. With the accumulation of time, they would surpass all living beings sooner or later.
 It was equivalent to cultivating countless years earlier than the new living beings. Even ordinary living beings could become mighty figures.
 “After the calamity ends, the Sages can no longer attack under the Heavenly Dao. You can rest assured about this. The one who controls all living beings is the Heavenly Race. The leader is an old friend of yours. You will know in the future. In other words, you can return in peace. There won’t be any danger.”
 The dream shattered.
 Han Jue realized that he had returned to reality. He asked, “Is what Qiu Xilai said just now true?”
 (4 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 (Yes]
 Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief. But when he really returned to the Immortal World, he had to do something.
 Han Jue continued to ask, “What’s his relationship with Sage Fated Secrets?”
 (4 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [According to favorability, they have a 3-star favorability.)
 3 stars!
 In other words, they were in the same boat for the time being, but there was a possibility that they would break up!
 Indeed, he couldn’t trust Qiu Xilai completely.
 Han Jue thought silently.
 When he thought of how the calamity had ended and the Heavenly Dao had restarted, Han Jue sighed.
 Fortunately, he had moved the Reroll World out in advance. Otherwise, it would have been destroyed.
 Wait!
 In that case, wouldn’t the Reroll World be the only mortal world below the Heavenly Dao?
 If he developed a little…
 Han Jue’s heart beat faster, and he didn’t dare to think about it.
 He could already see endless power and benefits surging towards him.
 As long as he worked hard, he might even become the most powerful existence below the Sages!
 He was even stronger than the past Heavenly Emperor, Zu Tu, the Heavenly Dao Buddha, and other ambitious figures!
 “Something’s wrong! This is a trap!
 “To destroy a person, one must first make them mad with greed!
 “The Sage wants to harm me!
 “I can’t appear on the surface, but I can support my disciples… Before the next calamity, if I become a Sage, the other Heavenly Dao Sages will definitely not be my match. And all the major factions below the Heavenly Dao are branches of the Hidden Sect. Doesn’t that mean…”
 The more Han Jue thought about it, the faster his heart beat.
 After being controlled by the Sages for so long, it was time for him to rise!
