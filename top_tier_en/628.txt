 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “You don’t have to care about Great Loose Heaven anymore. Regardless of whether he can join Han Jue in the end, you can’t suppress him.”
 There were only the Sages of the three schools of the Dao Sect in the hall. This was a small circle among the Sages.
 Even if the Jie School, the Human School, and the Chan School broke up, they were still connected inherently.
 The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate nodded. “I understand. No matter what, Han Jue is also on good terms with us.”
 Although the Hidden Sect was rapidly expanding, the South Extreme Heavenly Venerate still had a good impression of Han Jue.
 The situation of the forces in the Immortal World was ultimately a small matter. Even if the Hidden Sect controlled the Immortal World alone, they did not care. The calamity was a calamity for all living beings, but to Sages, it was only a game of chess.
 In a game, there were losses and wins. It was normal.
 “Tell me about Fang Liang. Why is he looking for you?” Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du asked.
 Ever since he came to the Heavenly Dao, he had become more humane and not as cold as before.
 Sect Master Tian Jue said, “Fang Liang is testing our relationship with the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End.”
 The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate nodded.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du narrowed his eyes. “Then, what do you think?”
 The two Sages weren’t fools and naturally understood what Fang Liang meant.
 Ever since the Dark Sage King died, they had objections to the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End, but they didn’t dare to say anything.
 “Senior, speak first!” The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate said in a low voice.
 Sect Master Tian Jue also stared at him.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du understood what they meant. The two Sages did not dare to act recklessly and needed someone to lead them.
 After thinking, Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “I was sent by a sect to manage the Heavenly Dao. I should have listened to the Human School, but I was born in the Heavenly Dao. I hope that the Heavenly Dao will not be affected by the outside world. I hope that the Heavenly Dao will grow freely. I also don’t want to see anyone wanting to destroy the Heavenly Dao. No matter who it is, if they dare to do this, I will definitely become their enemy. Even if my body and soul are destroyed, I will never regret it.”
 His tone was very serious and even made one feel hysterical.
 The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate and Sect Master Tian Jue were shocked. They were only testing him. They didn’t expect Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du to be so determined.
 The two Sages looked at each other. Sect Master Tian Jue gritted his teeth and said, “We were also born in the Heavenly Dao. We also had great ambitions at the beginning of becoming Sages, but...”
 Before the Dao Ancestor disappeared, the Heavenly Dao Sages were all chosen from the Heavenly Dao. They were all ambitious, but after becoming Sages, they discovered that things were not that simple.
 There was also the Great Dao outside the Heavenly Dao!
 The Heavenly Dao was controlled by the Great Dao!
 The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate said, “Since Senior said so, we can’t beat around the bush anymore. That’s right, we can’t stand the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End either! I even suspect that the Dark Sage King’s backing is those mighty figures in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End. They’re acting!”
 “I even suspect that Nüwa and Fuxitian are not dead at all!”
 Speaking of this, the South Extreme Heavenly Venerate was very angry.
 The Deity Realm of the Ruins of End always wanted to restrict the Heavenly Dao’s development. Every time the calamity erupted, the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End would send news, specifying who would win.
 The previous Heavenly Race was arranged by the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End!
 Sage Fated Secrets and Sage Jin’an obediently became dogs. What happened in the end?
 After becoming the Mad Sages, the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End directly abandoned them and even snatched their Primordial Purple Qi.
 As the saying went, the fox would mourn the dead rabbit. After the two Sages died, the other Sages couldn’t help but have some grudges. This was also the reason why they did not become enemies with Han Jue.
 They didn’t want to be a blade that would definitely kill them. Besides, Han Jue could help them protect the Heavenly Dao.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “Since you understand, I’ll tell you the plan directly. The Heavenly Dao Sages have to stand on the same side. Fang Liang should mean this. Li Daokong is Han Jue’s disciple. Don’t worry. Heavenly Venerate Wufa, Qiu Xilai, the Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage, and Shi Dudao will be our targets.”
 “We have to pull them to our side.”
 Sect Master Tian Jue frowned. “The Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage is so powerful. What if he’s unwilling?”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said indifferently, “If Han Jue can cripple a Sage, so can we!”
 The two Sages were shocked. They didn’t expect Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du to be so determined.
 “I don’t know what happened in the depths of the Chaos. The Deity Realm of the Ruins of End’s killing intent towards the Heavenly Dao is already very obvious. The Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage is a signal. In order to support him, they even dare to attack the ancestor!” Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du’s expression darkened.
 The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate asked, “But we aren’t the Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage’s match...”
 “We can’t kill him, but in the Heavenly Dao, he can’t kill us either. What we have to do is restrain him and not let him nurture a force. When Han Jue has absolute confidence in killing the Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage, he will definitely attack. Han Jue is very smart. He will protect the Heavenly Dao.”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said firmly, “From today onwards, the three schools of the Dao Sect will target the Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage and the demons. If the Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage dares to support the demons or other factions, the three schools of the Dao Sect will besiege him! We won’t give him a chance!”
 Hearing this, the South Extreme Heavenly Venerate and Sect Master Tian Jue agreed.
 After kneeling for a hundred years, Han Jue finally moved Great Loose Heaven into the Daoist temple.
 After seeing him, Great Loose Heaven was pleasantly surprised and hurriedly kowtowed.
 Facing a Sage, what was kowtowing? I
 t was not embarrassing.
 Han Jue said, “The Sage positions are already full. Why do you feel that joining me is useful?”
 Great Loose Heaven gritted his teeth. “The Sage positions are already full even without you!”
 Han Jue smiled, but the divine light on his body covered his expression.
 “If I help you become a Sage, what can I obtain?” Han Jue asked.
 Great Loose Heaven replied without hesitation, “Eternal loyalty!”
 “Oh? Then do you mind if I plot against you?”
 “I don’t mind!”
 “It seems that you’re very determined.”
 “The Sages have let me down. This is my only way. Instead of being a dog for the other Sages, I’d rather be a dog for you. I can see your attitude towards your disciples from Li Daokong. I won’t regret it. Sage, please give me a chance!”
 Great Loose Heaven placed his forehead on the ground again.
 He trembled. Even a Pseudo-Sage couldn’t suppress his emotions.
 In order to become a Sage, he had lost all his self-esteem and face!
 If Han Jue refused, not to mention him, the entire Loose Heaven Sect and the Loose Heaven Realm would become a joke in the myriad worlds!
 He was gambling.
 He could only gamble like this.
𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com Han Jue said, “Go back and deal with the sect. Cultivate diligently in the Hundred Peak Immortal River next. You can become a Sage, but I need you to endure for a period of time.”
 “No problem!”
 Great Loose Heaven agreed in surprise.
 (Great Loose Heaven has a favorable impression of you. Current favorability: 5 stars] Han Jue waved his hand and sent him out of the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 Great Loose Heaven’s worship was both a good and not so good thing for Han Jue.
 In his eyes, the game of Heavenly Dao was not too important.
 He cared more about the power of Sages now.
 On that day.
 A dignified voice resounded through the myriad worlds.
 “I am the Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage. I was born in the Golden Crow Divine Clan and was once the first Heavenly Emperor of the demons. The order of the Heavenly Dao has collapsed and the Sages have changed. When I return, I will set up the order of the demons and set up the order of the Immortal World. We Heavenly Dao living beings should not only kill each other and fight for providence. We should also be united and expand the Heavenly Dao in the chaos!
 “From today onwards, the demons must cultivate for the expansion of the Heavenly Dao. I am willing to use my great providence to descend on the demons. All living beings can enter the demon race and enjoy the providence of the Sages!”
