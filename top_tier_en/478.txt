 He had to be wary of such situations in the future.
 Han Jue chose to accept and quickly entered the dream.
 In the dazzling hall, Han Jue saw Qiu Xilai. He was still high and mighty.
 Han Jue was furious when he saw him.
 I want to see what you are really up to! Qiu Xilai said in a low voice, “Prepare to fight for the position of Sage!”
 Han Jue said, “Oh.”
DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com Qiu Xilai asked, “You have 200 Immortal Emperors under you? Those people seem to be the Nether Race created by Empress Houtu?”
 “That’s right,” Han Jue replied. He wasn’t afraid of being found out anymore.
 Qiu Xilai said, “You can’t trust Empress Houtu completely. After all, she carries the blood feud of the Magus Race. Don’t be dragged down by her.”
 “Thank you for your reminder, Sage.”
 “Yes, the Buddhist Sect will appear soon. When the time comes, let Chu Shiren be the Buddha.”
 “Alright.”
 “As for fighting for the position of Sage, it’s up to you. I’ve already prepared the Primordial Purple Qi needed for the position. It’s up to you to work hard.”
 “I understand. Thank you for your kind intentions, Sage.”
 “Mm.”
 The dream shattered.
 Han Jue returned to reality and immediately started to break through.
 To him, this guy’s words were simply bullshit.
 He had to break through first!
 Twenty years later.
 Han Jue successfully broke through!
 A vast aura spread out from his Daoist temple, causing the Hidden Sect disciples to look over.
 Did Han Jue break through or comprehend a Mystical Power?
 Even Dao Sovereign who was at the Zenith Heaven Realm felt suffocated.
 The difference in talent was too great!
 Han Jue checked his attributes panel as he consolidated his cultivation.
 (Name: Han Jue]
 [Race: Primordial Fiendcelestial (Immeasurable Emperor)]
 (Cultivation: Mid-stage of the Pseudo Primordial Chaos Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm]
 [Technique: Primordial Chaos Reincarnation Great Dao (Great Dao), Heavenly Cycle Body Tempering]
 (Great Dao: Great Dao of Life and Death, Great Dao of Karma, Great Dao of Extreme Origin]
 His lifespan had almost tripled again!
 Awesome!
 Han Jue’s current lifespan was almost near infinite. Even the Immortal World might not have such a long lifespan.
 Not bad!
 He had to deal with Sage Fated Secrets later!
 Han Jue closed his eyes silently and continued to consolidate his cultivation.
 After another thirty years, his cultivation completely stabilized.
 After that, he spent a few months raising his Sword Dao Mystical Powers before continuing to cultivate the Fiendcelestial Dharma idols.
 Twenty years later.
 Han Jue condensed nine Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols. They were Thunderbolt Fiendcelestial, Malevolent Fiendcelestial, Abyss Fiendcelestial, Blood Fiendcelestial, Extreme Ice Fiendcelestial, Light Fiendcelestial, Cloud Fog Fiendcelestial, Extreme Secret Fiendcelestial, and Resentment Fiendcelestial.
 At this point, Han Jue had grasped a total of 22 Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols!
 When the 22 fiendcelestials attacked together, even a Sage would need ten breaths of time to kill him.
 Han Jue could insta-kill anyone under the Sage Realm, no matter who it was!
 When his cultivation level increased by one level, Han Jue’s strength also increased by a lot!
 Han Jue didn’t condense a new Fiendcelestial Qi in the world of stars. Instead, he took out the Book of Misfortune and started cursing Sage Fated Secrets.
 His lifespan had been refreshed and had tripled. He had to curse him to liven things up!
 Five days later.
 Han Jue’s lifespan began to decrease rapidly.
 He stared at his attributes panel and checked his emails.
 (Your good friend Heavenly Emperor has received guidance from a mysterious mighty figure. His cultivation has increased greatly.]
 [Your disciple Long Hao has condensed his body again.)
 (Your grand-disciple Fang Liang has entered the Dark Forbidden Zone.)
 (Your good friend Li Daokong has broken through the Heavenly Dao shackles and stepped into the Pseudo-Sage Realm.)
 (Your Dao Companion Xuan Qingjun has comprehended the Heavenly Race’s Dao Technique. Her cultivation has increased greatly.)
 [Your good friend Pan Xin broke through the seal and was attacked by the ancient Master of Calamity. He was severely injured.]
 (Your good friend Jiang Dugu was attacked by your good friend Li Daokong and was severely injured.)
 Li Daokong had actually become a Pseudo-Sage. It was unexpected but totally reasonable.
 After all, Li Daokong was the eldest disciple of the Human School. He had already experienced the calamity. How could his cultivation not increase?
 Li Muyi had probably given him a lot of special treatment.
 Poor Jiang Dugu couldn’t defeat Li Daokong now.
 Han Jue was very curious. Who was this ancient Master of Calamity?
 He would ask in the future.
 He couldn’t derive it just because of his curiosity. It had to involve himself.
 Otherwise, there were too many unknowns in the entire Immortal World. If Han Jue really asked them one by one, no amount of lifespan would be enough.
 Han Jue’s lifespan continued to decrease.
 A billion years! Ten billion years!
 A hundred billion years!
 A trillion years!
 Two trillion years!
 Outside the 33rd Heaven.
 In the hall, Sage Fated Secrets raised his hand and circulated his energy to resist the strange curse.
 “Damn Dark Forbidden Lord, the curse power has strengthened again. He still dares to pretend. He’s definitely a Sage!”
 Sage Fated Secrets cursed silently. This curse had already surpassed the power of a Pseudo-Sage.
 However, he did not panic. He could still resist.
 As time passed, Sage Fated Secrets frowned even more.
 The mental demon he had suppressed previously jumped out again.
 “You’re the strongest Sage. Why must you look at the other Sages?”
 “You don’t rely on the Dao Ancestor’s Dao teachings or the Providence Sect. You relied on your own cultivation to become a Sage. You’re the destined one!”
 “Activate the Dao Destruction Mystical Power and destroy the teachings of all the Sages!”
 Sage Fated Secrets ignored the mental demons and used his supreme Dharmic powers to protect his Dao heart.
 Another period of time passed. His Dharmic powers began to waver. The curse power of the Dark Forbidden Lord had already reached a terrifying level.
 “Who is it…”
 Sage Fated Secrets gritted his teeth. He thought of a Sage with such a curse.
 A Sage who was not a Heavenly Dao Sage!
 Li Muyi of the Human School!
 It was very likely!
 Li Muyi wasn’t weaker than him. He wasn’t a Heavenly Dao Sage. If Li Muyi cursed him, he would indeed find it difficult to predict.
 Furthermore, as the Sect Master of the Human School, Li Muyi also controlled the other two branches of the Dao Sect. Killing the other Sages was indeed beneficial to the Dao Sect.
 Sage Fated Secrets was enlightened and his eyes turned cold.
 When Han Jue’s lifespan decreased by 18 trillion years, he finally saw the emails about Sage Fated Secrets. He immediately stopped cursing
 (Because of your curse, the Dao heart of your enemy, Sage Fated Secrets, has cracked. His mental demons are rising.)
 Enough!
 It was worth it!
 It was almost impossible to curse a Sage to death at once.
 Han Jue wanted to grind him to death.
 After resting for a few days, Han Jue continued cursing. This time, he cursed Qiu Xilai.
 Although Qiu Xilai had helped him in the previous calamity, this fellow wanted to trick him and even used the Sage position to tempt him.
 Han Jue cursed him as a warning.
 He didn’t want this fellow to disturb him when he had nothing to do.
 After cursing for five days, Han Jue put down the Book of Misfortune.
 He stood up and stretched.
 This was a secret technique he had learned in his previous life. The art of body stretching.
 He was just reminiscing. Han Jue was a Pseudo-Sage and didn’t need to stretch his muscles.
 As he moved, he used his divine sense to observe the situation in the Dao Field.
 Recently, several Connate lifeforms had transformed. Like the previous Connate lifeforms, they started following Han Zuitian. From time to time, they would patrol the Hundred Peak Immortal River for some reason.
