 Han Jue asked in surprise, “Didn’t the Ancestral Magus die?”
 Could it be that the Ancestral Magus was like Dijun and Eastern Emperor and did not truly die? Empress Houtu said, “Indeed, but I also heard their calls.”
 “Have you found them?”
 “No.”
 “Be careful, it might be a trap.”
 Han Jue reminded. Although Empress Houtu was not a Heavenly Dao Sage, her status in the Heavenly Dao was very important. It would be troublesome if the netherworld was lost.
 Empress Houtu said, “I know. I won’t leave again. I sent you a dream this time mainly to ask if you arranged for Su Qi. If so, I’ll instill the providence of the Six Paths into his body to help increase his cultivation and let him control the power of reincarnation.”
 Han Jue was surprised. Empress Houtu was so generous? As if sensing his gaze, Empress Houtu explained, “I’ve been in this position for countless years. My cultivation level has not increased and I’m already numb. Su Qi is a Chaotic Fiendcelestial. Perhaps under his lead, the cycle of reincarnation can go further. I don’t believe the Sages. I only believe you. The reason why I believe you is that I can sense the growth of the Nether Race. If the Heavenly Dao needs a leader, you are the best choice in my eyes.”
 [Empress Houtu’s favorability towards you has increased. Current favorability: 6 stars]
 Empress Houtu’s favorability toward Han Jue was already extremely high. However, it had been rising and falling over the years. Now, it could still increase her favorability. It seemed that what she said was true.
 On careful thought, it made sense. If Empress Houtu was related to the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End, how could she stop here? After splitting open the sky, how many batches of Heavenly Dao Sages had there been? Empress Houtu was still stuck here. Han Jue said, “I have no intention of becoming the master of the Heavenly Dao. It’s just that the Heavenly Dao can protect me, so you can rest assured. I will do my best to protect it.” Empress Houtu smiled in satisfaction.
Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m The two of them chatted for a while more before Empress Houtu canceled the dream.
 Even Empress Houtu expressed that she wanted to protect the Heavenly Dao. This time, the Heavenly Dao had completely become united. Han Jue sighed.
 Indeed, if he wanted the others to unite, he had to have absolute strength!
 If not for Han Jue being strong enough, how could the Sages be so united?
 Han Jue had a sudden thought. He wanted to know what the outcome of the Heavenly Dao would be if this continued.
 (Ten billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?) Continue!
 Han Jue entered the illusion. At this moment, his heart skipped a beat.
 An illusion meant a result. There would be no fixed outcome if they remained peaceful!
 In other words, the Heavenly Dao would still face danger!
 Han Jue opened his eyes and discovered that he was in front of the Universal Hall. Countless figures were standing in front of the Universal Hall. All of them emitted a powerful aura. Han Jue glanced at them.
 Wow!
 More than a hundred Sages! The others were all Pseudo-Sages!
 How many years had it been since the Heavenly Dao had developed to this point?
 Boom
 The door to the Universal Hall opened, and Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du and a group of Sages walked out. A few of them made Han Jue feel unfamiliar.
 Li Daokong, Shi Dudao, and Fang Liang were among them. Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du had a solemn expression. The other Sages were the same.
 “Are you prepared to face the supreme power of the Chaos?” Emperor Xiao shouted in a low voice that resounded outside the 33rd Heaven. “I swear to protect the Heavenly Dao!” The mighty figures gathered near the Universal Hall replied in unison. This scene made Han Jue think of the future of the Heavenly Court. Could it be that they were facing the same enemy? Furthermore, the Heavenly Court had lost!
 Han Jue sensed something and suddenly looked up. He saw a pair of eyes appear in the darkness at the peak of the Heavenly Dao, looking down at it. In front of these eyes, the entire 33rd Heaven looked tiny. What a cold gaze! Even Han Jue felt a chill in his heart. This was a suppression of cultivation realm. Han Jue subconsciously lowered his head and didn’t dare to look at the other party. If he was already like this, let alone the others. “Everything is just fabricated. I want to create reality!”
 A voice sounded. In an instant, a dazzling white light filled the 33rd Heaven, causing everything to lose its color.
 The illusion shattered. It meant the Heavenly Dao died! Han Jue opened his eyes and frowned. He had heard that voice before. A long time ago, it had pulled him into a dream and said the same thing.
 Illusion...
 Who was it?
 Han Jue frowned.
 This mysterious existence was definitely not born in the future. It might already be a powerful existence now.
 The Heavenly Court, which had swept through the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End, could not stop him.
 The Heavenly Dao that had formed its own rules was easily destroyed by him! That power was definitely not that of a Transcendent Dao Expert. It was definitely stronger!
 Han Jue was filled with pressure. It wasn’t terrifying to have many enemies. What was terrifying was not knowing who the enemies were.
 Han Jue gave up and wanted to ask who the voice was.
 [It involves karma that surpasses the current limits of the system. It cannot be deduced.]
 Han Jue frowned again. Hurry up and cultivate! The fiendcelestial army’s plan had to be sped up. Han Jue didn’t appear in the illusion just now. What did this mean?
 Han Jue guessed that he should have been frightened away or restrained. If it was the latter, it meant that the other party was not alone.
 No matter what, the other party couldn’t come for the time being
 Han Jue adjusted his state of mind. His Dao heart was as stable as a Buddha, and he quickly entered his cultivation state.
 In the Dark Forbidden Zone, in a place where meteors gathered, two figures quickly interwove. All sorts of Mystical Powers shattered the meteors, creating a huge commotion. In the distance. The Evil Heavenly Emperor and the Black Heaven General floated in the air and watched quietly. Black Heaven General suddenly sighed. “As expected of the Chaotic Fiendcelestials. They are indeed powerful. They don’t spend any effort cultivating their Mystical Powers.
 Their combat instincts are also extremely strong.” Evil Heavenly Emperor smiled. “They will be the capital for the Heavenly Court to rise. Black Heaven General, as a senior, you have to guide them more. The three Heavenly Generals will not change. If the three of you can unite, the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End will sooner or later be trampled under my feet.” Black Heaven General hurriedly replied, “Of course. I won’t be jealous or suppress them.” The Evil Heavenly Emperor did not reply and continued to watch Han Tuo and Yi Tian fight. At this moment, a crack appeared on the Evil Heavenly Emperor’s right side. An eye appeared in the crack and stared at him. “Your Majesty, I discovered that a Little Heavenly Dao had been broken through by the Inauspicious Evil. Should I accept the living beings of this Little Heavenly Dao?”
 “Come, connect them to the Dark Domain. You will be in charge of settling them down,” the Evil Heavenly Emperor replied. His gaze did not leave the two of them.
 “Yes.”
 The crack shrank and the voice vanished. The Evil Heavenly Emperor turned around and disappeared after saying, “I’ll leave them to you. Don’t disappoint me.”
 Black Heaven General hurriedly bowed.
 In the Immortal World. Another thousand years passed.
 These thousand years were extremely exciting. The Sages preached the Dao in the Dao Field one after another and even took in many disciples to travel the heavens and teach Dao techniques. The Sages after unity were still very impressive. In just a thousand years, with their help, many prodigies appeared in the Immortal World. The providence of the Heavenly Dao had greatly increased.
 Not only that, but the Sages had also established Chaotic Cities at the edge of the Immortal World. There were already nine Chaotic Cities now. It was worth mentioning that a race had been rapidly rising in the past thousand years. Human Race! With Li Daokong’s help, the self-imposed Human Race rose again.
