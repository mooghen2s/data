 Han Jue remained calm and asked, “I have a way to save you. Come to the Hundred Peak Immortal River.”
 There was no negative effect that couldn’t be purified!
 Ji Xianshen asked curiously, “What’s your cultivation level now?”
 “It’s only enough to save you.”
 “If you save me, you will probably offend the Sages.”
 “Cut the crap. Do you want to be saved?” Han Jue said impatiently. Why was this fellow so wishy-washy?
 Ji Xianshen curled his lips. He felt wronged. Indeed, it was no longer the feelings from back then.
 He hurriedly said, “I want to go! Give me time. I’ll look for you after I’m done!”
 Han Jue nodded and ended the dream.
 Then, he continued to send dreams. This time, he visited the Primordial Chaos Heavenly Devil.
 They hadn’t contacted each other for thirty thousand years. Although his favorability didn’t decrease, Han Jue felt that it was unstable. Back then, in order to survive, this fellow directly hypnotized himself and developed a six-star favorability towards him. It was extremely ridiculous.
 The dream realm quickly formed.
 In the chaos. Han Jue saw that the Primordial Chaos Heavenly Devil had a physical body. It was a handsome Buddha. He wore a kasaya, and his right arm was revealed. His muscles were well-defined and emitted a domineering aura.
 When the Primordial Chaos Heavenly Devil saw Han Jue, he was immediately vigilant. The divine light of the Sun and Moon Yin-Yang Protection covered Han Jue’s face, preventing him from recognizing the other party.
 “Dream?”
 Primordial Chaos Heavenly Devil frowned. He wanted to break through the dream realm, but he could not.
 The other party’s cultivation level far exceeded his!
 Pseudo-Sage!
 Han Jue said, “You don’t recognize me anymore?”
 With that said, the Primordial Chaos Heavenly Devil was moved. He couldn’t forget Han Jue’s voice.
 He asked carefully, “Master?”
 Han Jue said, “Congratulations on becoming a Buddha. I wonder if your heart is with me or with the Buddhist Sect.”
 Primordial Chaos Heavenly Devil hurriedly said, “Of course, I’m on your side. I’ve been waiting for an opportunity beyond the heavens. Now that I’ve become the Buddhist Sect’s Buddha, do you have any instructions?”
 “No. I just came to see you.”
 “Thank you for your concern, Master.”
Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates The Primordial Chaos Heavenly Devil was extremely nervous. He couldn’t forget the torture.
 In his slumber, he often dreamed of the past.
 Han Jue asked, “Who is in charge of the Buddhist Sect now?”
 Primordial Chaos Heavenly Devil replied, “Divine Might Buddha; he’s already a Pseudo-Sage.”
 Divine Might Buddha…
 This fellow was still alive!
 Han Jue thought that when the Buddhist Sect was dissolved, the Divine Might Buddha had already died. He didn’t expect him to still be alive.
 It seemed that the dissolution of the Buddhist Sect was a self-directed act. Qiu Xilai still wanted to trick him into joining the Buddhist Sect.
 Fortunately, he didn’t take it seriously!
 If he went before attaining the Dao, he would probably never return.
 Han Jue asked a few more questions, and the Primordial Chaos Heavenly Devil replied truthfully.
 Five minutes later, the dream ended.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and frowned.
 Although the Primordial Chaos Heavenly Devil’s attitude was very humble and his favorability did not decrease, he felt that it was not reliable.
 “I want to know if the Primordial Chaos Heavenly Devil is loyal to me?”
 (A billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [He’s loyal for the time being. As long as you don’t die, or if he doesn’t die because of you.]
 Han Jue was speechless.
 This fellow was also a talent.
 He was a talent in managing emotions to express loyalty to others!
 Han Jue still couldn’t completely believe the Primordial Chaos Heavenly Devil. Perhaps this fellow would betray him at some point.
 Han Jue thought silently and started cultivating
 As time passed, the Immortal World became more and more exciting. There were countless races, and the Providence Sect walked the world to preach the Dao. It could be said that hundreds of flowers were blooming.
 The humans were relatively weak because they were a race that survived the previous calamity. They were restricted by the Heavenly Dao rules. Mortals had life and death, but the other races were different. They had long lifespans and almost all only died in battle.
 Eight hundred years later.
 A god of plague appeared in the Immortal World. Wherever he went, the plague spread, causing chaos.
 For a time, the Immortal World stirred. The Hundred Peak Immortal River was completely unaffected.
 In a bamboo forest, Han Eight and Han Zuitian were drinking.
 Han Zuitian smiled and said, “How about it? The wine my subordinates made is not bad,
 right?”
 Han Eight nodded slightly. He, who was already at the Deity Realm, looked very cold and was no longer the timid youth from back then.
 The eight gourd spirits had special identities in the Hidden Sect. Their status was even slightly higher than the second-generation disciples because their surnames were Han, personally given by Han Jue.
 Their talent was also very good. The eight brothers were all already Deity Realm existences. Han Eight’s talent was the highest, and he had been competing to become a disciple at the first tier.
 Han Eight asked, “Why are you looking for me? I still have to cultivate. I lost to Zhou Fan in the last hundred-year competition. I’m indignant.”
 Han Zuitian smiled. “It’s like this. I want to ask you brothers to take in disciples. You don’t have to preach the Dao like Grandmaster. Just occasionally teach them combat Mystical Powers. I have a living being under me who has natural eyes that can see through the nine heavens. He sees more and more factions in the Immortal World, and sooner or later, all sorts of battles will break out. We can’t always rely on Grandmaster’s protection.”
 Hearing this, Han Eight frowned. He didn’t reject him. He indeed wanted to help Han Jue.
 They had always been cultivating diligently and had never repaid him. In Li Xuan’ao’s words, this was impossible in the Sage Sect. Han Jue was too merciful.
 “Alright, I’ll discuss it with my brothers when I return,” Han Eight replied.
 Han Zuitian immediately beamed.
 At the same time.
 Inside the Daoist temple.
 Han Jue suddenly opened his eyes. He frowned and looked up at the sky.
 A strange black cloud had unknowingly appeared above the Hundred Peak Immortal River. There was no thunder and it was silent.
 Han Jue’s gaze pierced through the clouds and saw a ten thousand foot tall figure hidden in the dark clouds.
 He wore sinister black armor and had a human form. He had eight arms and a pair of wings on his back. He flapped them slightly. His face was black, but his eyes were very bright and filled with killing intent.
 Pseudo-Sage!
 This fellow was observing the Hundred Peak Immortal River!
 Han Jue used the simulation trial.
 [Thousand Madness Devil: Mid-stage Pseudo-Sage Realm, Bloodline of the Devil Race, Chaotic Heavenly Devil, Immeasurable Emperor]
 There was more than one title.
 Han Jue directly entered the simulation trial and killed the other party instantly.
 Too brittle.
 Now, he could kill a Pseudo-Sage with a finger.
 Han Jue wasn’t in a hurry to attack. He wanted to see what this fellow wanted to do.
 In the clouds, Thousand Madness Devil suddenly frowned.
 “It’s indeed not simple. Fortunately, I’m not in a hurry to attack,” he muttered to himself. In that instant, he felt an extremely dangerous aura, making him feel like he was facing the Devil Ancestor.
 It seemed that it was almost impossible to take down the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 Thousand Madness Devil turned around and prepared to retreat.
 “You want to escape? Are you afraid?”
 A voice entered Thousand Madness Devil’s ears. He didn’t stop. As he retreated, he replied, “I’m indeed afraid. I’m afraid there is a Sage in the Hundred Peak Immortal River. Although I don’t know why they appeared in the Immortal World, my instincts are correct.”
 The voice sounded, “As long as you make a move, I will impart my Sage powers to you. You only need to break through the array formation of the Hundred Peak Immortal River. At that time, the Heavenly Dao will expel the Sage inside. When he leaves the Immortal World, the Sages will deal with him. After it’s done, you can obtain the Primordial Purple Qi.”
