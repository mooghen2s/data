 His words broke the silence, attracting the support of the other Heavenly Race mighty figures.
 Speaking of the devils, they gritted their teeth. Ji Xianshen frowned.
 The hall fell into chaos. Other than Ji Xianshen, everyone was denouncing the sins of the devils.
 After a long while…
 After everyone was silent, Ji Xianshen slowly asked, “I want to ask, what grudge do you have with the Devil Race? Don’t mention the ancient legends, just talk about yourselves.”
 The Heavenly Race mighty figures looked at each other.
 They didn’t follow Ji Xianshen’s words but doubted in their hearts.
 Had the Heavenly Ancestor been possessed by the devils?
 Or was his Dao heart deceived?
 It was so outrageous!
 Even the Heavenly God General looked at Ji Xianshen differently.
 Facing his subordinates’ strange gazes, Ji Xianshen almost died of anger.
 These people were really impossible to communicate with!
 Ji Xianshen suppressed his anger and shook his head. He waved his hand to signal everyone to leave.
 Thirty years passed quickly after Han Jue finished his lecture.
 Under Li Daokong’s domineering attack, the living beings who wanted to fight for the Primordial Purple Qi were chased away. The remaining were low-level living beings who indicated that they had no ill intentions.
 After that battle, the Hidden Sect’s reputation spread again.
 The news of Li Daokong joining the Hidden Sect quickly spread throughout the Immortal World.
 The news that the eldest disciple of the Human School had joined the Hidden Sect caused the Immortal World to criticize him.
 The Hidden Sect was completely famous. It was getting closer and closer to becoming a first-rate overlord force in the Immortal World. At least, that was how it was famous.
 On this day.
 Han Jue cursed Sage Fated Secrets. Although he had just broken through, he didn’t spend a large amount of his lifespan on him.
 After the simulation trial, Han Jue felt that the possibility of cursing a Sage to death was almost zero.
 It was fine to mess with him. He should save his lifespan in the future and not waste it.
Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates Han Jue wasn’t far from attaining the Dao. When the time came, he would personally kill Sage Fated Secrets!
 He stood up and stretched.
 At this moment, the Strange Deity rushed in and stopped in front of him. It wandered around as if it was in a hurry.
 Han Jue communicated with it.
 “You said you want to go out?” Han Jue frowned and asked.
 The Strange Deity nodded. Although it couldn’t speak and its expression could not be seen, it accurately displayed a pitiful appearance.
 Han Jue subconsciously wanted to reject, but the Strange Deity rarely expressed such strong intentions.
 Moreover, even if he let this fellow out, others wouldn’t be able to see it.
 Even Li Daokong couldn’t spy on the Strange Deity. The Strange Deity passed by Li Daokong’s side. Although Li Daokong frowned, he did not notice anything.
 “What are you going to do outside?”
 The hands of the Strange Deity kept shaking. Han Jue couldn’t understand it at all and could only rely on his telepathy. After all, they had fused a long time ago.
 It wanted to go out because something outside was attracting it. It wanted to go and take a look.
 Han Jue secretly used the derivation function. “What attracted it?”

 [Misfortune, Resentment, Killing Intent, and Negative Karma]
 Han Jue frowned and continued to ask, “Is a Sage plotting against it?”. [3 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [No]
 Han Jue was relieved. He looked at the Strange Deity and said, “Come back soon. Don’t harm the living beings!”
 The Strange Deity nodded desperately.
 Han Jue waved his hand and sent it out.
 The Strange Deity also had its own way of becoming stronger. Other than relying on Han Jue, it didn’t need to cultivate at all, so there was no point in keeping it to cultivate.
 Its departure did not cause any commotion in the Hidden Sect because other than Han Jue, no one else knew of its existence, even if it often wandered in the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 After stretching, Han Jue sat on the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus again and began to comprehend the Great Dao cultivation technique, the Primordial Chaos Reincarnation Great Dao.
 The Primordial Chaos Reincarnation Great Dao recorded several methods to attain the Dao. The worst was to rely on the Primordial Purple Qi to attain the Dao. Therefore, the Primordial Purple Qi was actually the key to the Heavenly Dao. Only by obtaining this key could one open the Heavenly Dao and obtain its providence. By relying on the power of the Heavenly Dao, one could become a Sage. If the Heavenly Dao wasn’t destroyed, it would be very difficult for the Heavenly Dao Sage to die, unless they encountered the Immeasurable Calamity.
 Han Jue naturally couldn’t take this path.
 He didn’t want to tie his life to the Heavenly Dao.
 He wanted to walk on the path to the strongest Dao attainment method!
 Use strength to attain the Dao!
 He could rely on his great Dharmic powers to forcefully break through the realm shackles and reach the Undying Realm!
 The so-called using strength to attain the Dao meant cultivating a Great Dao. Han Jue’s Great Dao of Extreme Origin was equivalent to the gathering of three thousand Great Dao. If he successfully attained the Dao, he felt that he would definitely be the most perfect Sage! He would also be the strongest Sage!
 What Han Jue wanted to do now was to fuse the Great Dao of Extreme Origin with his body and soul. He would become the Great Dao and not merely control its power.
 In theory, it was very simple. In fact, it was very difficult. His body could hardly withstand the power of the Great Dao. However, Han Jue had the Stellar Primordial Body. Cultivating it was easier than cultivating the Heavenly Dao lifeform.
 Han Jue couldn’t predict when he would attain the Dao for the time being, but he would definitely be able to!
 At the edge of the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 Han Zuitian stood at the foot of the hill, and ten steps away stood the three immortals.
 These ten steps were the isolation area of the Dao Field array formation. It was invisible and colorless. It indeed existed.
 Eagle Head Immortal said carefully, “Senior, we’ve investigated the matter you asked us to investigate. The most talented person in the nearby area should be the Long-arm Ape. This Long-arm Ape is one of the Four Chaotic Monkeys. It’s said that in the Primordial Era, the Four Chaotic Monkeys were extraordinary existences. There was once a Long-arm Ape that made even Sages sigh in admiration.”
 Han Zuitian raised his eyebrows. “What’s his cultivation level?”
 “Emperor Realm.”
 “Help me recruit him. All of you, serve me well. When the Hidden Sect recruits disciples again, I can help you plead on your behalf.”
 “Thank you, senior!” the three immortals said in surprise. They knelt down and kowtowed to Han Zuitian.
 Han Zuitian waved his hand indifferently, and the three immortals left.
 Seeing them leave, Han Zuitian couldn’t help but sigh.
 “Even if I pretend, I’m still far inferior to Grandmaster. Perhaps I’m lacking light behind my back?” Han Zuitian muttered to himself, envy appearing in his eyes.
 He yearned for the Sun and Moon Yin-Yang Protection behind Han Jue the most. It was too impressive.
 Han Zuitian had never seen an existence stronger than Han Jue. Even his grand-disciple felt suffocated every time he faced him.
 Then, Han Zuitian turned around and prepared to leave.
 “Young friend!”
 An old voice floated over. Han Zuitian turned around.
 A stooped figure emerged from the ground. He had white hair and a youthful face. He held a walking stick and had a benevolent expression.
 Han Zuitian raised his eyebrows, seemingly surprised that the other party had come out of the ground.
 The old man smiled and said, “I’m the Earth God of the Hundred Peak Immortal River. I was sent by the Heavenly Race. Can you introduce me to the Sect Master of the Hidden
 Sect?”
