 When his consciousness returned to the Connate Cave Abode, Han Jue opened his eyes and frowned.
 The cultivation difficulty of the Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm far exceeded his imagination. Although his absorption speed was still very fast, he did not accumulate much cultivation. He was far from the mid-stage Zenith Heaven Realm.
 Han Jue had no choice but to look at the Grand Unity Aspect.
 The Grand Unity Aspect was the easiest way to increase his strength now.
 Although it was very safe in the Dao Field, the Immeasurable Calamity was still ongoing. Han Jue had to increase his strength as much as possible.
 He began to cultivate his second Dharma idol.
 The second Dharma idol was different from the Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial. Its power was extremely sinister and terrifying.
 Han Jue was very cautious when cultivating this Dharma idol, afraid that he would suffer a backlash.
 It took him nearly twenty years to cultivate this Dharma idol.
 The Nine Yin Fiendcelestial contained the power of Yin, able to devour souls and techniques. It was extremely powerful. If mastered, one could even devour the Great Dao upon greater mastery!
 After Han Jue succeeded, he immediately entered the simulation trial.
 Both Dharma Idols appeared at the same time. No one below the mid-stage Golden Immortal Realm could defeat him. Even if they were at the late-stage Golden Immortal Realm, Han Jue could still fight.
 After reaching the Zenith Heaven Realm, other than Dharmic powers, what was truly tested were Mystical Powers and Dharma treasures.
 Every Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal had their own powerful Dharma treasure, but not everyone had a Heavenly Dao Supreme Treasure like Han Jue.
 “Too strong. There are only two Dharma Idols now. When I have a hundred, won’t I be invincible in the Zenith Heaven Realm?”
 Han Jue was extremely excited.
 He continued to comprehend the third Dharma idol.
 However, he was stunned to find that he could no longer comprehend the third Dharma idol. The Grand Unity Aspect seemed to have closed the door to him as the huge quantity of memories vanished.
 What happened?
 Could it be that he could only cultivate two Dharma Idols from the Grand Unity Aspect?
 Han Jue sensed carefully. The inherited memories of the Grand Unity Aspect were still there, but they sealed themselves in the depths of his soul. He couldn’t forcefully open them as a strange force blocked him.
 Han Jue’s heart tightened and he asked in his mind, “Could it be that the Grand Unity Aspect is a trap of the Sages?” [Everything given by the system is 100% harmless.]
 Han Jue laughed at himself.
 He was really too cautious.
 “Then, I want to know. Why can’t I continue the inheritance?” Han Jue asked in his mind.
CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m (Cultivation is insufficient. This Mystical Power contains a Great Dao restriction.]
 Han Jue suddenly understood. So, that was the case.
 It seemed that cultivating the Grand Unity Aspect was not feasible. He had to increase his cultivation first.
 Han Jue sighed. He could only start the long and boring process of devouring negative karma.
 At this moment, he realized why those Zenith Heaven Golden Immortals were so unrestrained.
 Even cultivating the Stellar Primordial Body was so troublesome, let alone the others.
 Another ten years passed.
 Han Jue took out the Book of Misfortune and cursed Jade Emperor Zhou Yan while checking his emails.
 [Your good friend Heavenly Emperor was cursed by a mysterious curse.]
 (Your disciple Su Qi has devoured the Inauspicious Evil and the power of misfortune has transformed.]
 (Your grand-disciple Fang Liang has reversed the fate of the Heavenly Court and revived your good friend Divine General. The providence of the Heavenly Court has begun to revive.] (Your good friend Ji Xianshen was attacked by human cultivators] x1222287
 (Your good friend Li Daokong was attacked by Jade Emperor Zhou Yan.]
 [Your good friend Li Daokong was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure and was severely injured.)
 (Your Dao Companion Xuan Qingjun has entered the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End.] [Your disciple Long Hao has created a Heavenly Dao Mystical Power that can shock the world and make ghosts and gods weep.]
 Han Jue was shocked to see that Su Qi devoured the Inauspicious Evil.
 This kid seemed to have embarked on an evil path and was becoming stronger.
 No matter how he looked at it, Su Qi looked like an evil villain.
 The Dark Forbidden Lord had a successor!
 As for Fang Liang, he could actually reverse the fate of the Heavenly Court. What kind of method was this?
 In any case, Han Jue was frightened. People who died could be revived by him?
 Could this kid be the reincarnation of the Dao Ancestor?
 The more Han Jue thought about it, the more he felt that it was suspicious.
 “I want to know Fang Liang’s most hidden true identity,” Han Jue asked in his mind.
 (5 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 So expensive!
 Han Jue cursed silently. Why did everyone around him have a powerful background?
 Could it be that a huge hand was pushing all of this?
 Han Jue gritted his teeth and chose to continue.
 [Fang Liang: Rank Three Immortal Emperor, successor of the Dao Ancestor, master of the Heavenly Court. The Dao Ancestor preached the Dao to the heavens and distributed providence for the children of the world. Because Fang Liang kept rising and had great karma with you, he was chosen by the Dao Ancestor to be his successor.)
 Dao Ancestor’s successor!
 So impressive?
 Han Jue was shocked. Why was it still related to him?
 The Dao Ancestor was paying attention to him?
 It was not only the Dao Ancestor. There were also Nüwa, Empress Houtu, Sage Jin’an, Ancestor Xitian, and others. Han Jue discovered that he was targeted by many Sages. Most importantly, these Sages did not directly target him. Instead, they used others to approach him.
 Could it be because he had transmigrated through the Primordial Chaos?
 The more Han Jue thought about it, the more likely it was.
 If the Sages wanted to harm him, they would definitely hate him.
 So far, the Sages had only paid a little attention to him.
 That made sense. Sages looked down on the myriad worlds in the universe. How could they easily develop emotions towards some insignificant living being?
 Most importantly, the Sages did not know where he was hiding!
 Han Jue didn’t have to worry at all.
 After thinking about this, Han Jue felt relieved.
 No matter what, with Fang Liang’s identity as the Dao Ancestor’s successor, he should be able to survive in the future.
 “This calamity is really becoming more and more interesting. Even the Dao Ancestor is involved.”
 Han Jue thought silently. Thinking about it now, it was a joke that Jade Emperor Zhou Yan wanted to eliminate the Dao Ancestor.
 It was even more ridiculous for Zu Tu to challenge Nüwa.
 Everything was within the Sages’ plans!
 “Wait, could this change be related to me?” Han Jue thought of this and was terrified.
 He was also very helpless.
 Was this fate?
 Even Sages couldn’t escape from it?
 Heavenly Court, Imperial Garden.
 Fang Liang sat in the courtyard and drank with the Divine General.
 Fang Liang smiled and asked, “How do you feel?”
 The Divine General sighed. “Thank you, Your Majesty. You’re truly remarkable. I’ve never heard of such a Mystical Power.”
 He wasn’t flattering Fang Liang. The fact that his soul was revived was unimaginable.
 Fang Liang’s face was a little pale as he smiled and said, “Among the Three Great Generals, I trust you the most. The Heavenly God General is unfathomable. The Martial God General is anxious for quick success. Don’t act recklessly in the future. I will arrange a new identity for you.”
 “Your Majesty can decide,” the Divine General said seriously. He changed the topic and asked, “How’s the previous Heavenly Emperor?”
 Fang Liang smiled and said, “Don’t worry, he’s fine. It seems that the Heavenly Emperor did not misjudge you. You’re so loyal. If you become the Heavenly Emperor, it will also be a blessing for the Heavenly Court.”
 The Divine General shook his head and said, “I know myself. I’m suitable for battle and not leadership.”
 Fang Liang smiled and did not say anything else.
 At this moment, the sky suddenly changed color. Purple light filled the sky and strange phenomena appeared. Heavenly flowers scattered and three flowers gathered at the top. It was dazzling.
 The Divine General frowned and muttered, “Another Zenith Heaven appeared.”
 Fang Liang asked, “Do you want to become a Zenith Heaven cultivator?”
 Hearing this, the Divine General looked at him in surprise, not knowing what he meant.
 Fang Liang said calmly, “Although I’m only an Immortal Emperor, I have a way to help you quickly become a Zenith Heaven cultivator. However, you will also pay a tragic price.”
