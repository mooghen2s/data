 “This is a Chaotic Numinous Treasure. It can even deduce Chaotic Fiendcelestials. What karma caused this mirror to shatter?”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor felt inexplicably uneasy. Could it be that a terrifying existence that surpassed Chaotic Fiendcelestials had targeted Han Tuo?
 “An ancient god who stands at the end of the River of Destiny. He’s a transcendent existence that has existed since the beginning of time. When we get there, without my instructions, you are not allowed to speak or look at him.” “Yes.”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor waved his hand and left with Han Tuo.
 In the Imperial City of the Human Race. Han Yu sat under a tree in his courtyard. There were dozens of cultivation formations set up in this courtyard, and the Connate Qi was extremely abundant.
 He suddenly opened his eyes, his handsome face revealing worry. “What’s happening?” Han Yu muttered to himself.
 In the past thousand years, he had been uneasy from time to time, as if a calamity was coming. This feeling was very uncomfortable. It was fine in the past, but now, it had already affected his cultivation.
 If this continued, Han Yu was worried that he would go berserk.
 He hesitated for a long time before leaving. Several days later, he arrived at the top of the Buzhou Divine Mountain. There was a simple Daoist temple here. It was Li Daokong’s cultivation place in the past. He pushed open the door and bowed to the mat that Li Daokong had once sat on. “Master, I have something to ask you,” Han Yu said softly and respectfully. After a while, Li Daokong’s voice sounded, “What is it?”
 Han Yu told him about his troubles.
 Li Daokong said, “Don’t worry. Nothing will happen to you in the Heavenly Dao.” Han Yu hesitated before saying, “But this mentality has already affected my cultivation.” “Bear with it. It might be related to your ancestor. I can’t figure out why, but there’s one thing I can be sure of. Don’t leave the Heavenly Dao for the time being, understand?”
 “I understand.”
 Han Yu immediately understood when he heard that it was related to his ancestor. Perhaps his ancestor had encountered trouble and his bloodline had resonated, causing his Dao heart to become unstable.
 He had heard of such a thing before. As the saying went, if one lived, all would live. If one died, all would die.
 In a mysterious space. The personal disciples of the Hidden Sect gathered here. This was the Myriad Worlds Projection created by Han Jue’s system. When cultivating, personal disciples always liked to gather here. Through Zhou Fan, they could understand what was happening in the Immortal World and the Chaos. Li Daokong suddenly asked, “Is Sect Master not around recently?” Chu Shiren said, “Yes, why?” “Nothing. I just wanted to ask,” Li Daokong replied, heaving a sigh of relief. As long as nothing happened to Han Jue. Strangely, even after he became a Sage, he couldn’t spy on the Hundred Peak Immortal River. He wondered if Han Jue was still in the Hidden Sect. Xun Chang’an suddenly said, “There are too many. Master has a son who’s still in the process of being nurtured. He’s already been nurtured for four thousand years. He probably has extraordinary potential.” The other disciples sighed in anticipation. Li Daokong was stunned for a moment before coming to a realization.
 I see.
CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m Han Yu was indeed being affected by his bloodline. Li Daokong was not a gossipy person. He did not ask further. After understanding the reason, he was relieved and no longer worried about Han Yu. On the other side. Han Tuo followed the Evil Heavenly Emperor into chaotic space. The fog was vast, and colorful lights flashed from time to time.
 This was the first time Han Tuo had come to such a space. He couldn’t feel any life force, but the surrounding pressure caused him to tense up. He didn’t even dare to look around.
 He kept feeling that something was staring at him, making him feel uncomfortable. After traveling for an unknown period of time, the Evil Heavenly Emperor suddenly stopped. Han Tuo subconsciously looked up and saw a pair of huge legs as tall as the Buzhou Divine Mountain sitting in front of him. Looking up, he could only see the other party’s exposed belly button. Further up, it was covered by clouds.
 Just the lower half of his body was millions of feet tall. It was extremely huge and had an extremely visual impact. There was actually a cold eye in that huge navel. Meetings its gaze, Han Tuo’s soul almost exploded, scaring him so much that he hurriedly lowered his head.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor bowed and said, “Greetings, Divine Ancestor.” “Why are you here?”
 An ancient voice sounded. It spoke extremely slowly. Just these words made Han Tuo feel as if he had lived through the four seasons. This feeling was extremely strange. Han Tuo was shocked to discover that his Dharmic powers had increased greatly! His cultivation level increased just by listening to the other party?
 Han Tuo became even more nervous. The other party’s existence exceeded his imagination and understanding
 He suddenly forgot what the legs and belly button looked like. He did not dare to look up.
 “Divine Ancestor, what caused the divine mirror you gave me to shatter?” the Evil Heavenly Emperor asked respectfully.
 The ancient voice sounded, “This karma is too great. It’s not something it can withstand. It’s related to this child’s bloodline. A supreme expert will appear in his bloodline karma and overturn the chaos.”
 Shocked, the Evil Heavenly Emperor asked cautiously, “Has it already appeared and is about to break through, or is it about to be born?” “It’s still being nurtured.” The words of the ancient voice made the Evil Heavenly Emperor and Han Tuo think of many things. Han Tuo first thought of Han Yu. Could it be that Han Yu really would surpass him? Or could it be that Han Yu’s descendant would become a genius that shocked the Chaos? The Evil Heavenly Emperor thought of Han Jue. Was this kid going to have another child? When he was the Heavenly Emperor in the past, the Evil Heavenly Emperor had many children. Occasionally, children with extraordinary potential who shocked the Three Realms would appear, such as Long Hao.
 “Thank you for your guidance, Ancestor.”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor bowed. Since it was related to Han Jue, he couldn’t be bothered.
 He turned around and prepared to leave with Han Tuo.
 At this moment, the ancient voice sounded again, “This child is far from simple. Since ancient times, only two can compare to him.” The Evil Heavenly Emperor was stunned. He turned around and asked, “Giant God Pangu and the Dao Ancestor?” “Dao Ancestor? He’s just an opportunist.” The Evil Heavenly Emperor and Han Tuo were shocked. A terrifying expert comparable to the Giant God Pangu and surpassing the Dao Ancestor? The Evil Heavenly Emperor’s expression changed slightly as he hurriedly left with Han Tuo. “Don’t look back!”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor’s voice entered Han Tuo’s ears, scaring him so much that he followed closely behind and quickly flew away. Unknowingly, Han Tuo heard a strange song. It sometimes sounded like a resentful girl and sometimes sounded like a heroic shout, causing his consciousness to blur.
 When he woke up, he was shocked to discover that he had already returned to the Numinous Palace. Han Tuo’s consciousness quickly cleared. He looked at the Evil Heavenly Emperor and asked, “Your Majesty, just now…” The Evil Heavenly Emperor said expressionlessly, “What just now? A hundred years have passed. You were almost mesmerized by that old man’s Dao.”
