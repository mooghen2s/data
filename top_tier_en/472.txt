 [2: Maintain your initial determination and cultivate in a low-profile manner. You can obtain a new opportunity to activate a function of the system.]
 System upgrade!
DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com A new function of the system!
 As expected of the ten-thousandth year, it was quite impressive.
 Han Jue wanted to choose the first one, but it was too dangerous and not suitable for him.
 The system couldn’t make him stronger by leaps and bounds. Cultivation still depended on him.
 He couldn’t be reckless before he achieved absolute invincibility.
 Han Jue silently chose the second option.
 [New function of the system-Myriad Worlds Projection)
 [Myriad Worlds Projection: You can choose anyone and pull their consciousness into a projected space created by the system. No matter where the members are, they can communicate and transport Dharma treasures into the projected space. The Myriad Worlds Projection isolates karma and divine sense prying. The level of defense is related to the Dao Field.)
 Eh?
 This was…
 The Myriad Worlds Chat Group?
 Han Jue raised his eyebrows. He felt that this function was a little useless.
 However, he noticed that it could transport Dharma treasures. If a disciple couldn’t defeat the enemy, he could send the Dharma treasure over to help.
 But if that was the case, would the Dharma treasure be disarmed?
 Han Jue didn’t use the Myriad Worlds Projection immediately. He thought of the new function, Absolute Purification.
 This thing had been put aside and had yet to be used.
 “I’ll use Absolute Purification on Su Qi. Can it wash away his bad luck?”
 (100 million years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [Su Qi is the incarnation of misfortune. You can’t wash away his bad luck, but you can wash away the negative karma of the Heavenly Dao and the unstable elements of bad luck, helping him perfectly control the power of misfortune.]
 Han Jue raised his eyebrows.
 If Su Qi could control his bad luck, his cultivation would definitely improve by leaps and bounds.
 Han Jue immediately used Absolute Purification on Su Qi. He was suppressed in the world of stars and didn’t even need to be released. Han Jue could directly use the function.
 (A billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 (Beginning purification]
 Han Jue also activated the Myriad Worlds Projection. He first created the projection world.
 Soon, he had an idea.
 A dark hall appeared. Han Jue sat at the head of the table and faced two rows of precious chairs. Outside the hall was a bright galaxy.
 The projected area was not big. There was only this palace. It was usually enough for the disciples to communicate with each other.
 Han Jue immediately invited the Hidden Sect disciples into the projection world. The leader of the Nether Race also came.
 The leader of the Nether Race was called Han You, and he was already an Immortal Emperor.
 Everyone was stunned when they arrived at the Myriad Worlds Hall.
 Xing Hongxuan, Fairy Xi Xuan, and Chang Yue’er were also pulled over. After all, they were now part of the Hidden Sect.
 Everyone’s gaze landed on Han Jue. They weren’t nervous when they saw him.
 The Black Hell Chicken was the first to ask, “Master, what is this place?”
 Han Jue smiled and said, “This is a Mystical Power I created, the projection of the myriad worlds. In the future, no matter where you go, you can send your consciousness here and communicate. You can also exchange Dharma treasures.”
 Zhao Xuanyuan’s eyes widened. “This isn’t the Chaotic Domain?”
 He couldn’t help but look at Dao Sovereign.
 Dao Sovereign sighed. “Master is indeed Master. He can actually create such a Mystical Power. We can’t resist at all.”
 Before they could react, their consciousness was pulled into the Myriad Worlds Hall.
 “So that we can seek help when we go out in the future?”
 “How do you know? Senior Brother Dao likes to do this.”
 “Nonsense, what do you mean by like!”
 “Is this the Chaotic Domain you mentioned?”
 “If anything happens to me in the future, lend me your Dharma treasure.”
 Everyone found it novel and discussed it.
 Han Jue left the Myriad Worlds Hall.
 In the future, if the disciples wanted to enter, they could do it with a thought.
 Han Jue was about to resume cultivation when Xing Hongxuan’s voice came from the Daoist temple. “Husband, can I come in?”
 Han Jue said, “Come in.”
 Crap.
 Is this woman hungry again?
 Xing Hongxuan walked into the Daoist temple and sat beside him. She said, “Husband, recently, I’ve encountered trouble in my cultivation. I feel that it’s useless no matter how I cultivate. It seems that the cultivation technique is stuck. My master in the Human Race said that this cultivation technique needs to cultivate the Great Dao, but I don’t know what the Great Dao really is.”
 Han Jue smiled and said, “It’s fine. I’ll teach you a Great Dao.”
 Xing Hongxuan was pleasantly surprised and immediately jumped into his arms.
 Han Jue had already planned to teach the Great Dao of Extreme Origin to all the Hidden Sect disciples.
 Although he still needed to comprehend the Great Dao of Extreme Origin, it was created by him. Any living being who cultivated this Great Dao would nurture its creator while becoming stronger.
 It was the same no matter what.
 As the saying went, when a person obtained the Dao, all his friends would ascend to the heavens.
 The reason why Ancestor Xitian preached the Great Dao of Karma was not only for good karma but also to expand his own orthodoxy.
 Han Jue didn’t have to worry that the Great Dao of Extreme Origin of others would surpass his. The Great Dao was not a cultivation technique or a Mystical Power. All living beings who cultivated the Great Dao of Extreme Origin were paving the way for him. He was always stronger than the cultivators of this Great Dao.
 The Great Dao Inheritance was not that simple.
 Han Jue directly taught Xing Hongxuan with enlightenment, but it still took her thirteen years.
 After the inheritance ended, the two of them enjoyed themselves for a month before Xing Hongxuan left and returned to her residence to cultivate.
 During this period, Su Qi was successfully purified, but Han Jue didn’t release his soul immediately.
 He had nothing to do and started to check his emails.
 [Your good friend Huang Zuntian listened to the Sage preach and his cultivation increased greatly.]
 (Your good friend Qiu Xilai was attacked by a Sage] x2
 (Your grand-disciple Fang Liang has comprehended the Heavenly Dao. His cultivation has increased greatly.]
 [Your good friend Heavenly Emperor encountered the Primordial Divine Hall by chance. His providence has increased greatly.]
 (Your good friend Ji Xianshen was attacked by your enemy Li Xuan’ao.]
 (Your good friend Pan Xin was suppressed by the ancient Master of Calamity.]
 [Your good friend Jiang Dugu received guidance from a Sage. His cultivation has increased greatly.]
 It was boring. They were all emails about opportunities.
 However, when Han Jue saw Huang Zuntian, he became interested.
 Back then, he had sent Huang Zuntian to the Jie School. He didn’t expect that this fellow had already become the vice sect master.
 Should he contact him?
 Han Jue decided to dream of Huang Zuntian.
 Soon, the two of them entered a dream. In the dream was the forest outside the Jade Pure Sacred Sect.
 Han Jue met Huang Zuntian with his true body, but the divine light of the Sun and Moon Yin-Yang Protection was too blinding. The latter didn’t recognize him immediately.
 “How have you been?” Han Jue asked while the other party was nervous.
 Huang Zuntian was pleasantly surprised.
 How many times did he dream of returning to the Scarlet Cloud World?
 He finally saw Han Jue. Although it was only a dream, Huang Zuntian was still very excited.
 Wait!
 Could it be a scam?
 Huang Zuntian frowned.
 Han Jue saw through his suspicion and snorted. “Don’t worry. This dream is only between you and me. Even Sages can’t spy on it. Wasn’t I the one who instructed you to go to the Jie School?”
 Huang Zuntian’s favorability towards him had not decreased. He could be trusted.
 The Dark Nightmare wouldn’t be spied on by.
 Huang Zuntian felt relieved when he heard that. Suppressing his excitement, he said, “You’ve finally come to find me! When can I return to your side? I’m afraid that if I stay any longer, I’ll become the Sect Master!”
