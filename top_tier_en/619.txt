 A huge meteor floated in the void and murky darkness. On the meteor was a mighty black shadow meditating.
 It was the Chaotic Deity.
 The Chaotic Deity was surrounded by an ancient and mysterious black aura. It was difficult to tell its true body.
 He suddenly opened his eyes. A pair of cold eyes appeared in the black Qi as if they could see through time and fate.
 “Who’s cursing me? I can’t even deduce it?” the Chaotic Deity muttered to himself. He pinched his fingers to deduce. He could only deduce a book and not the person who used it.
 This curse was very strong!
 The Chaotic Deity first thought of the Curse Fiendcelestial, but it had not been born since the death of Pangu who split the heavens.
 Who was cursing him? The Chaotic Deity thought of many people and could not be completely certain.
 The curse power was still strengthening.
 The Chaotic Deity had no choice but to use his Dharmic powers to resist the curse.
 At this moment!
 The curse power suddenly increased. Previously, if it was described as a stream, it was now as violent as a torrent. It was unstoppable.
 “How can this be!”
 Shocked, the Chaotic Deity began to resist with all his might.
 Inside the Daoist temple.
 Han Jue’s eyes were bloodshot as he stared at his attributes panel.
 700 trillion years!
 800 trillion years!
 900 trillion years!
 Damn it!
 If breaking a quadrillion years was not enough, Han Jue would directly give up.
 In front of him, other than his attributes panel and emails, there was no information about the Chaotic Deity.
 When Han Jue’s lifespan was deducted to more than 980 trillion years, he finally saw an email. Almost instantly, he stopped.
 [Because of your curse, your enemy, the Chaotic Deity, has a chaotic Dao heart and the power of order has weakened.]
 Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief.
 As expected of the Great Dao Divine Spirit. Such a crazy curse only made his Dao heart chaotic. Even his mental demons did not appear.
 Han Jue began to rest.
 Several days later, he recovered.
 He took out the Book of Misfortune and started cursing Cundi.
 None of the mighty figures in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End could escape!
 Five days later, Han Jue’s lifespan decreased again. He also opened his attributes panel and emails and stared at them.
 He did not believe that this guy was stronger than the Chaotic Deity! The Chaotic Deity controlled the Chaotic Order. It sounded stronger than Cundi.
 In the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End, dark clouds surged. Above the endless wasteland stood a straight mountain. The top of the mountain shone with golden light. It was a dazzling temple.
 Spirit Mountain, Thunderclap Monastery!
 At the top of Thunderclap Monastery.
 Two white-haired Daoists were meditating side by side, each sitting on a lotus throne. One of the dignified Daoists opened his eyes and frowned. “Strange, I’m being cursed.”
 He was Cundi.
 The other Daoist was called Jie Yin.
 Cundi and Jie Yin had assimilated after the creation of the world. They were as close as brothers. Later, they established the Western Sect together, which was also the predecessor of the Buddhist Sect. They had always followed the Dao together and could not be differentiated.
 Jie Yin asked, “Have you deduced it?”
 Cundi shook his head. “I can’t deduce it. I can only deduce a book.”
Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m A book?
 Jie Yin frowned.
 They were Great Dao Sages. After being cursed, they actually could not deduce the other party’s existence. In other words, the other party was very likely stronger than them.
 “Wait, a book? Could it be the Dark Forbidden Lord of the Immortal World?” Cundi frowned.
 He had heard Qiu Xilai mention the Dark Forbidden Lord.
 Jie Yin said, “Isn’t the Dark Forbidden Lord Li Muyi or the Sect Master of the Hidden Sect? Li Muyi is already dead. He can only be the Sect Master of the Hidden Sect?”
 Cundi said, “Is he that strong? Although he’s a variable that the Dao Ancestor has determined, he can’t be stronger than us, right?”
 “That makes sense. He has never admitted that he’s the Dark Forbidden Lord. He even said that he has been cursed before. In that case, the Dark Forbidden Lord should be from the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End. In that case, his actions in the previous calamity were to destroy the Heavenly Dao.”
 “Oh? You mean that the Dark Forbidden Lord is among the other Great Dao Sages in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End?”
 “That’s right. I really can’t figure out why the Dark Forbidden Lord was in the previous calamity of the Heavenly Dao.”
 Cundi fell into deep thought. He felt that Jie Yin’s words made sense.
 Jie Yin changed the topic. “If the Dark Forbidden Lord wants to destroy the Heavenly Dao and the Sect Master of the Hidden Sect protects it…”
 Cundi did not reply.
 He felt that Han Jue couldn’t escape suspicion.
 Five days later.
 Cundi’s expression changed as he said in surprise, “Oh no! The curse has strengthened! How can it be so powerful?”
 He began to circulate his energy to resist.
 Jie Yin frowned.
 If the curse alone could injure Cundi, how strong was the Dark Forbidden Lord?
 Inside the Daoist temple.
 Han Jue didn’t know that he was being suspected. He was cursing with all his might.
 100 trillion years!
 200 trillion years!
 300 trillion years!
 500 trillion years! [Because of your curse, your enemy Cundi’s Dao heart was damaged.]
 r cu  ir en  Han Jue immediately stopped.
 That’s it?
 He was really far inferior to the Chaotic Deity.
 Han Jue rested again.
 Next, he planned to target the Immortal World and confuse the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End’s mighty figures.
 The next day, he began to curse the Heavenly Dao Sages, cursing them for a day each.
 It couldn’t be helped. If he cursed for five days, these Sages might directly collapse.
 Han Jue jumped to the 33rd Heaven and came to the Universal Hall. He sent a voice transmission to all the other Sages.
 The door to the Universal Hall opened.
 Han Jue walked into the hall, and Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du asked in surprise, “Fellow Daoist Han, what is it?”.
 Han Jue didn’t say anything. The divine light covered his body, preventing Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du from seeing his expression.
 Not long after, the other Sages arrived.
 They were uneasy. This was the first time Han Jue summoned them. Did something happen again?
 “Who’s cursing me?” Han Jue said in a low voice. A violent pressure descended and enveloped the entire hall, startling all the Sages.
 The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate hurriedly said, “Fellow Daoist Han, you were also cursed? Me too!”
 The other Sages all echoed him.
 “I’ve also been cursed for a day.”
 “Why were we all cursed?”
 “Someone must be acting.”
 “Could it be because of the Dark Sage King?”
 “It’s possible. Fellow Daoist Fuxitian has already died. There’s one less Heavenly Dao Sage. We can’t panic.”
 The Sages were also furious. They had all been cursed by a mysterious curse and were extremely unhappy.
 Han Jue glanced at Emperor Xiao. This fellow had pretended to be the Dark Forbidden Lord before.
 Emperor Xiao was also very angry. He was really the best actor.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “Fellow Daoist Han, we were all cursed. We can’t panic at this juncture. Don’t you think it’s too coincidental? We were cursed the moment we killed the Dark Sage King.”
 Han Jue retracted his aura and said, “I hope it’s not you guys. The Heavenly Dao is in trouble. You asked me to help. I have a clear conscience towards you and the Heavenly Dao. I just want to cultivate well. If you provoke me, don’t blame me for not showing mercy.”
 With that, he disappeared.
 The Sages’ expressions were ugly. Han Jue was really not giving them face, but they didn’t dare to retort. Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du scanned them and said, “I hope Fellow Daoist Han is wrong. The current Heavenly Dao needs our help. Don’t ruin things for your own schemes.”
 The Sages nodded. They were all guessing who was cursing behind his back.
 He even dared to curse Han Jue!
 If they didn’t fight side by side earlier, with Han Jue’s personality, he might have directly killed them…
 The Sages shivered.
