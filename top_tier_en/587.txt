 He wasn’t angry. This kid didn’t understand the importance of potential. No matter how strong he was, he couldn’t compare to him. Han Tuo also understood his potential. He already had the Chaotic Physique. Only a few people in the world could reach this realm.
 As his own descendant, he could tell that his bloodline was diluted through the generations. No matter how strong Han Yu’s potential was, it would not be that strong. Han Tuo asked, “Are you really not coming with me?”
 “No!”
 “Fine.”
 Han Tuo did not stand on ceremony and left.
 Han Yu watched him leave with a complicated expression until he disappeared on the other side of the mountain range.
 “Hmph! Just you wait!”
 Han Yu snorted and entered the cave abode.
 He didn’t hate Han Tuo. He only wanted to prove to him that he did not need to rely on his ancestor!
 No.
 Han Yu stopped in his tracks. He suddenly thought of that ancestor’s ancestor. He had been in the Immortal World for so long, but he had never encountered that ancestor.
 He had a feeling that that ancestor was definitely an extraordinary existence!
 “I have to prove it to him.”
 Han Yu’s fighting spirit soared and his eyes became firm.
 At the same time.
 On the peak of the Buzhou Divine Mountain, in an ordinary-looking stone hall, Li Daokong was thinking. “This child looks so similar to the Sect Master. I actually didn’t notice that the Han family was wiped out and only he survived…” Li Daokong pinched his fingers to deduce Han Tuo’s descendant and learned of the Han family’s situation.
 He suddenly felt that Han Jue might have specially arranged for Han Yu to survive.
 Could it be that this kid possessed potential that he was unable to see through?
 The more Li Daokong thought about it, the more he felt that it was possible.
 After all, Han Yu was too similar to Han Jue!
 Another thousand years passed.
 Han Jue left his cultivation state on time. He pinched his fingers to deduce and deduced Han Tuo and Han Yu’s encounter.
 He was amused.
 There was a good show to watch.
 If there were no accidents, it was impossible for Han Yu to threaten Han Tuo.
 Han Jue thought for a moment and decided to support Han Yu and let him provoke Han Tuo in the future.
 Of course, he wouldn’t reveal this thought to prevent Han Yu from thinking too much.
 He wasn’t afraid that Han Tuo would be agitated after knowing the truth. He had helped Han Tuo many times in the dark. If this kid was still an ingrate, he would throw him into the Primordial Heavenly Prison.
 In Han Jue’s heart, no one was more important than himself!
 This was also the reason why he could reach this point.
 If he risked everything for others, Han Jue might have died on the path of cultivation already.
 “We’ll see in the future. Let him cultivate for a period of time first.”
 Han Jue thought silently. There was still a long time. He didn’t have to be rash and immediately help Han Yu.
 He started checking his emails.
 (Your good friend Huang Zuntian was attacked by a mysterious Pseudo-Sage and was severely injured.)
 (Your disciple Ji Xianshen was cursed by a mysterious curse.)
 (Your good friend Zhang Guxing was cursed by a mysterious curse.]
 [Your son Han Tuo was cursed by a mysterious curse and was severely injured.)
 (Your good friend Immortal Emperor Samsara was cursed by a mysterious curse.] (Your good friend Empress Houtu discussed the Dao with a mysterious Sage. Her cultivation has increased greatly.]
 (Your good friend Jing Tiangong has cursed too many times and has encountered Heavenly Punishment. He has developed mental demons.]
 [Your good friend Dijun crossed the River of Destiny and was attacked by an ancient Chaotic Deity.)
 Huang Zuntian had indeed suffered a failure.
 Han Jue couldn’t help but mourn for him.
 Huang Zuntian was already a Pseudo-Sage. It was very difficult for him to die in the Immortal World, so Han Jue was not worried about his life.
 Looking down, Jing Tiangong was courting death!
 This fellow must have pretended to be the Dark Forbidden Lord and suffered a backlash.
 Han Jue decided to find him later.
 He also saw Dijun being attacked by the ancient Chaotic Deity. These ancient existences were really rare.
 Existences like Ancestor Xitian, Jade Bodhi, Seven Dao Sage, Dijun, and other Transcendent Great Dao existences rarely appeared in the emails, let alone being attacked.
 Their circle was too novel to Han Jue.
 It was unknown what Transcendent Dao Expert and Great Dao Divine Spirit would do other than cultivate.
 Was it boring?
 After becoming strong enough, there was nothing worth pursuing. It was indeed very boring
 Han Jue laughed at himself. He was really worrying for nothing.
 He continued reading. Almost all his good friends outside were moving. Without deducing, Han Jue let his imagination run wild and found it very interesting.
 After reading all the emails, Han Jue sent a dream to Jing Tiangong and used the image of the Dark Forbidden Lord.
 In the dream.
 Jing Tiangong was extremely excited.
 How many years had it been!
 The Dark Forbidden Lord had finally appeared!
 He knelt in front of Han Jue and cried in joy. He didn’t have the bearing of the previous Sect Master of the Jie School or a Pseudo-Sage at all.
 Han Jue used the voice of the Dark Forbidden Lord to say, “Why are you pretending to be me recently and suffered the outcome of mental demons?”
 Jing Tiangong said in shame, “I just want you to show your power again. You’re really powerful. You can actually sense that I’m suffering the backlash of the Heavenly Dao.”
 His eyes were filled with admiration.
 “What do you think about the Darkness Sect and the Divine Palace?” Han Jue asked.
 Jing Tiangong said, “The Darkness Sect can only hide in the dark. I need the Divine Palace as a shell. Furthermore, it has great potential. They have two prodigies with the Chaotic Physique!”
 I knew it!
 This fellow was going to the Divine Palace to be a traitor.
 Han Jue said, “There’s no need. Cultivate well and help the Divine Palace become stronger. One day, I will appear. Before that, don’t act recklessly and don’t harm yourself.”
 Hearing this, Jing Tiangong was extremely touched.
 Han Jue continued, “What you have to do now is to become as strong as possible.”
 He thought for a moment and raised his finger to impart to him the Five Elements Divine Light.
 This Mystical Power was not created by him alone. It could be traced back to the mighty Kong Xuan of the Primordial World.
 After learning this Mystical Power, Han Jue rarely used it, so he was not afraid that others would think of him.
Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com Caught off guard, Jing Tiangong was forcefully taught a Mystical Power. He couldn’t move.
 After a long while…
 When Jing Tiangong opened his eyes, the dream had already ended.
 “This Mystical Power… is so domineering!”
 Jing Tiangong was pleasantly surprised. The Five Elements Divine Light could forcefully snatch an enemy’s Dharma treasure and forcefully break through an array formation!
 Snatching treasures!
 There was nothing it couldn’t capture!
 Jing Tiangong rejoiced in his heart. He had benefited from a disaster.
 At the same time, he was more determined.
 Inside the Daoist temple.
 Han Jue was in a good mood. Jing Tiangong’s loyalty made him very comfortable.
 After the calamity, it was very precious that Jing Tiangong still respected him.
 His only flaw was that this fellow was too reckless.
 The Divine Palace was already controlled by Han Jue. It could even be said that Zhang Guxing was already controlled by him. If Zhang Guxing wanted to deal with him, with a command from Han Jue, Jing Tiangong and Immortal Emperor Samsara would definitely attack him.
 This was the effect Han Jue wanted.
 All the major forces were controlled by him, and the person in charge on the surface had nothing to do with him. Even if the person in charge failed, the punishment of the heavens would not fall on him. He could still enjoy these powers.
 Currently, Han Jue didn’t have any ulterior motives. He just wanted to make preparations in advance.
 Next, he would target the Dragon Palace and the demons.
 His disciple Long Hao could go to the Dragon Palace. Jiang Yi, Ah Da, and Xiao Er could go to the demons.
 However, the Famous Race had nothing to do with him.
 Han Jue fell into deep thought.
 Against the Famous Race, who should be planted as a spy?
