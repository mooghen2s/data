 Han Jue pinched his fingers to deduce, but he couldn’t find anything. It was possible that the Dark Sage King had not entered the Heavenly Dao.
 He had to use the derivation function.
 (Ten billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 Han Jue entered the illusion.
 When he opened his eyes again, Han Jue saw Han Tuo.
 This was a dark world. Strange lightning interwove in the sky. The ground was desolate and swamps of different sizes emitted a stench. Looking up, bones were strewn everywhere.
 Han Tuo walked very carefully and was vigilant.
 A ball of black aura suddenly appeared in front of him and quickly expanded. It surged violently, and a pair of eyes appeared from it
 These eyes were evil and cold as they looked down at Han Tuo.
 Dark Sage King!
 “Human ant, how dare you come here?”
 Although Han Tuo was a little nervous, he did not panic. He only heard him say, “I heard that the Reincarnation Mystic Realm can revive the dead. You only need to pay a price.”
 Han Jue was surprised.
 The Dark Sage King actually had a stronghold in the Immortal World?
 He had always been paying attention to Han Tuo. This kid had not left the Immortal World.
 Reincarnation Mystic Realm…
 What a good excuse!
 The Dark Sage King said, “The price of reincarnation is not small. The closer you are to someone, the greater the price. Karma cannot be reversed.”
 Han Tuo took a deep breath and said, “I want to revive my wife!”
 Han Jue cursed silently.
 Lil’ brat!
 Why not revive your parents?
 Indeed, he was abducted by women when he grew up.
 The Dark Sage King was silent for a moment before saying, “To revive your wife, you have to offer half of your lifespan. Are you willing?”
 Han Tuo asked, “What if I want to resurrect my parents?”
 “You also need to spend half of your lifespan.”
 “In other words, I can only choose one? Not both?”
 “Reincarnation is already a treacherous thing. How can it go as planned?”
 Han Tuo fell silent.
 He took a deep breath and said, “In that case, forget it. No matter who I choose, my heart will be burdened with guilt. I’ll come again when I’m stronger. One day, I’ll be able to do as I wish!”

 left.
 “How can the Reincarnation Mystic Realm be a place where you can come and go as you wish?
 “Since you’re here, leave your providence behind!”
 The Dark Sage King transformed into a vast black mist and directly drowned Han Tuo. His speed was so fast that Han Tuo didn’t even have time to react.
 Immediately after, a spatial crack appeared beside the black mist. Covered in blood, Han Tuo was spat out and thrown into it.
 The illusion ended.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and fell into deep thought.
 He observed the Immortal World and found the location of the Reincarnation Mystic Realm. It was at the edge of the Immortal World, hidden in a separate space. There were continuous mountains near the entrance, and people were sparse.
 Han Jue thought for a moment and used the Dark Nightmare to visit Qiu Xilai in his dreams.
 In the dream, Qiu Xilai was slightly shocked. The dream came too suddenly.
 Han Jue directly told him about the origins of the Dark Sage King and talked about the Reincarnation Mystic Realm.
 Qiu Xilai was moved. A terrifying existence that could make Li Muyi suffer was not something they, the Heavenly Dao Sages, could defeat.
 “The Reincarnation Mystic Realm has already appeared for three Immeasurable Calamities. It seems that the Dark Sage King has long targeted the Heavenly Dao,” Qiu Xilai frowned and muttered to himself.
 Han Jue said, “I’ll leave this to you. I have to continue cultivating to prevent the Dark Sage King from attacking.”
 Qiu Xilai nodded without any objections.
 Han Jue’s greatest use was his strength.
 It was also a good thing that he was willing to stay in seclusion. As for the other Sages, they no longer needed to cultivate. It was difficult for their cultivation levels to increase. If they wanted to become stronger, they had to start from the Heavenly Dao’s providence.
 The stronger the Heavenly Dao was, the stronger the Heavenly Dao Sage became!
 After the dream ended, Han Jue looked at Han Tuo.
 He and the Son of the Heavenly Dao, Yi Tian, were together. Their relationship was actually not bad. The two of them sparred on an island and laughed.
 Han Jue frowned slightly.
 Han Tuo’s aura was somewhat similar to Yi Tian’s. In addition to Yi Tian’s identity, the Sages would definitely sense Han Tuo.
 Forget it.
 It was normal that he couldn’t hide it. After all, Han Tuo was also becoming stronger.
 Although he had yet to completely become a Primordial Fiendcelestial, he was also different from all living beings. Back when Han Jue transformed into a Primordial Fiendcelestial, he had even entered the Chaotic Domain. Perhaps the Chaotic and Primordial Chaos had a close relationship.
 “Tsk tsk, the Son of the Heavenly Dao is really absurd. He’s only been born for a few years and is already almost at the Deity Realm!” Han Jue muttered to himself. He discovered that Yi Tian was covered in treasures. He clearly did not acknowledge a master, but he had grasped a powerful Mystical Power. It was at least a Sage Mystical Power.
 What a great Heavenly Dao!
 I don’t care about the rules. I’ll provide cheats to my son!
 Han Jue raised his right hand and cast another spell.
 He wanted to loosen Han Tuo’s bloodline seal again. This time, he would directly release half of it. However, he didn’t know if it could compete with the Son of the Heavenly Dao’s bloodline.
 On the other side.
 On a vast island, Han Tuo and Yi Tian were fighting
 The two of them did not use any spell Mystical Powers. Instead, they sparred with their bodies.
 Before Han Tuo rose, he had relied on his physical strength. Yi Tian was a Chaotic Fiendcelestial. His physical potential was even stronger than the Ancestral Magus back then.
 Boom
 Han Tuo was struck by Yi Tian’s fist again and fell on the hill, causing dust to fly.
 Yi Tian floated in the air with his hands on his waist and laughed proudly. “Han Tuo, you can’t do it. I haven’t even used my true strength and you’re already down! Do you still want to be my big brother? You should be my younger brother!”
 Han Tuo got up with difficulty and spat out a mouthful of blood.
 At this moment, he suddenly felt something enter his body. Immediately after, he felt relaxed and relieved.
 This feeling…
 Han Tuo became excited. He knew this feeling too well!
 In the past, he had encountered this many times. Every time he felt this, his cultivation level would increase greatly.
 He believed that he had broken through the limits of his bloodline!
 Humans were the spirits of all living beings. Every mortal had unlimited potential, but they could not find a way to break through the shackles!
 Han Tuo thought so. The reason why he could constantly break through the shackles was definitely related to his persistence.
 Nas
 Han Tuo meditated.
 Yi Tian looked at him suspiciously.
 “He seems to be becoming stronger… Indeed, he’s the same as me…”
 Yi Tian’s eyes flickered with excitement.
 Before meeting Han Tuo, he was extremely lonely. Although he had countless subordinates, he was lonely in his heart. He felt desolate as if he had nowhere to return to.
 Time passed.
 Another five hundred years passed.
 In the past five hundred years, the Immortal World had changed greatly. The Heavenly Race, who had obtained the support of the Hidden Sect, began to fight everywhere. Other than the various races in the Immortal World, they also wanted to control the mortal world. Just like the past Heavenly Court, their momentum became greater and greater.
 However, there was no movement from the Heavenly Court. Those who didn’t know would think that it had already been disbanded.
 Many experts appeared in the Immortal World. Their names shook the world. Yi Tian was one of them. He called himself the Great Sage Heaven’s Equal.
 This name came from a story Han Tuo had told him. He had heard it from his father when he was young.
 Hundred Peak Immortal River. Just as Han Jue finished preaching, he looked at the Nether Race.
 Han You and the 1,000 Nether Zeniths had returned long ago, but Li Daokong was still pestering the Three Pure Sacred Ancestor like a fly.
 Currently, most of the cultivation of the ten thousand Nether Race members were near the Three Mystic Divine Origin. If he wanted to cultivate all of them to the Zenith Heaven Realm, it would probably take tens of thousands of years or even longer.
