 “Kneel? What a joke!”
 Li Daokong smiled mockingly. “If I had the time of another Immeasurable Calamity, I can kill you with one strike!
 “Sages? The true Sages have long disappeared. You’re only wearing the hat of Sages and will do anything for your own selfish desires!
 “Our Hidden Sect wasn’t defeated by you, it was just that we were no match for the heavens!
 “I, Li Daokong, will not die in your hands. You’re not worthy!”
 With that said, his body emitted a strong light.
 The scene shattered.
 Han Jue’s consciousness returned to reality and he frowned.
 So tragic?
 The Heavenly Dao wanted to target the Hidden Sect?
 From Li Daokong’s words, that should be the case. After all, Han Jue had deduced that the Heavenly Dao wanted to use Qiu Xilai to scheme against him.
Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com Han Jue asked silently, “If I directly curse the Heavenly Dao, what will happen?”
 [Ten billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 (Likely to suffer a backlash from the Heavenly Dao. If the curse succeeds, everything in the Heavenly Dao will be destroyed.]
 Han Jue frowned. Destroying everything in the Heavenly Dao was too much unless he had no choice.
 “Looks like I have to fight for providence and control the Heavenly Dao.”
 Han Jue made a decision, and his eyes became firm.
 “What’s the time of the scene from earlier?” Han Jue asked.
 (Three billion years later.)
 This time, the system did not deduct his lifespan.
 Han Jue was relieved when he saw this time.
 Too early!
 Since he knew the outcome, Han Jue could change it!
 He had to stabilize himself first!
 He would wait for other Pseudo-Sages to appear in the Hidden Sect.
 Han Jue felt that it was not appropriate for Li Daokong to help the Heavenly Race alone.
 No matter how strong Li Daokong was, he was not a Sage. He might not survive if he was surrounded by Pseudo-Sages.
 Then, Han Jue closed his eyes and continued cultivating.
 …
 On the 13th Heaven, Emperor Chen was about to continue flying when a figure sped over.
 Emperor Chen glanced over and frowned.
 The newcomer looked identical to Zhao Yun and Dian Wei. They were Shi Dudao.
 Shi Dudao wore a dragon-patterned black robe. He looked imposing and his gaze was sharp.
 He came in front of Emperor Chen and asked, “Have you thought about it?”
 Emperor Chen said calmly, “How many followers do you have?”
 Shi Dudao replied, “There are already three thousand of them. All of them have Mystical Powers that are enough to overturn any providence sect in the world.”
 “In other words, we can’t defeat the combined forces of two providence sects?”
 Emperor Chen’s question made Shi Dudao frown.
 He stared at Emperor Chen and said, “Although you’re the Human Race’s Emperor, the Human Race has long forgotten about you. Why don’t you follow me? If I control the world, I will definitely regain the identity of the Heavenly Dao Race.”
 Emperor Chen shook his head. “There are a hundred regions in the Immortal World and ten thousand worlds in the Heavenly Dao. You, Shi Dudao, are not the number one person below the Sages. If you want to rope me in, you have to make a name for yourself first. Once you become the number one person below the Sages, I’m afraid I won’t be the only one. All the hidden mighty figures in the myriad worlds will be fascinated by you.”
 Shi Dudao frowned even more.
 He didn’t say anything. He turned around and left, quickly disappearing into the horizon.
 Emperor Chen shook his head and disappeared into the 13th Heaven.
 Three hundred years later.
 Just as Han Jue finished speaking, the Hundred Peak Immortal River fell silent. More than a million disciples were still comprehending the Dao.
 He came to the Fusang Tree and observed its growth. Not only the Fusang Tree, but there were also many natural treasures under the tree. It had grown well.
 Ah Da, Xiao Er, and the Black Hell Chicken crawled on the branches. They were all huge.
 If the Black Hell Chicken did not speak, it would indeed be handsome and oppressive. It wasn’t inferior to the two Golden Crows.
 Recently, Han Jue discovered that the Immortal Qi and Connate Qi supply in the Dao Field was almost unable to keep up.
 Although the Immortal Qi in the Dao Field was richer than anywhere in the Heavenly Dao, the size of the Dao Field couldn’t compare to the Heavenly Dao at all.
 Thousands of Deity Realm, several Zenith Heavens, and a million cultivators. The Dao Field couldn’t keep up.
 “Other than the array formation of the Dao Field, I also have to consider the level of Spirit Qi.”
 Han Jue sighed in his heart.
 If there were only a few people in the Dao Field, it would be impossible for him to face such a problem. However, he was nurturing a million living beings. There were gains and losses.
 However, it was still fine for the time being. As long as the number of living beings did not increase, and the disciples’ breakthrough speed was not that fast, they shouldn’t notice the problem with Spirit Qi.
 “How can I think that? Isn’t this what I want?”
 Han Jue shook his head and laughed.
 In a few hundred years, he would reach 40,000 years old.
 He should be able to produce good stuff then. There was no need for the system to upgrade. It wasn’t too much to upgrade a Dao Field, right?
 Han Jue shouted at the system silently.
 The system didn’t reply. It was normal. This system was not smart enough and did not communicate with him usually.
 If it really communicated with Han Jue often, he would instead be flustered, as if there was another person in his body.
 Then, Han Jue returned to the Daoist temple and checked his emails while cultivating.
 (Your good friend Jiang Dugu was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure and was severely injured.)
 (Your good friend Primordial Yuan Phoenix was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure and was severely injured.)
 (Your grand-disciple Fang Liang dreamed of the Dao Ancestor when he was cultivating. His cultivation has increased greatly.)
 [Your good friend Yang Tiandong was attacked by the Devil Race) x13920
 (Your good friend Empress Houtu was attacked by your good friend Emperor Xiao.]
 (Your good friend Han Ming was attacked by your good friend Immortal Emperor Samsara and was severely injured.)
 (Your good friend Pan Xin was attacked by a mighty figure and was severely injured.)
 As he watched, he saw that many got severely injured!
 He thought that the Immeasurable Calamity had begun again.
 Some long-lost friends began to appear, such as Immortal Emperor Samsara and the Primordial Yuan Phoenix.
 As for Han Ming…
 Han Jue almost forgot about Han Ming, his cheap younger brother. Anyway, their blood ties were already severed.
 Han Ming was very sensible and didn’t come back to find him to cause trouble.
 The two of them seemed to be unrelated and continued living their own lives.
 It was worth mentioning that Han Ming’s favorability towards Han Jue was still six stars. This meant that he didn’t forget him or hate him.
 If Han Ming’s potential was not bad, he could accept him.
 What a pity.
 Han Jue was just thinking casually. He didn’t want Han Ming to become his weakness.
 Not to mention Han Ming, if Han Jue really faced a dilemma, he would only choose himself.
 He had worked hard for immortality his entire life. Everything he obtained along the way was embellishment. He couldn’t forget his true intentions.
 Soon, Han Jue’s attention shifted to the others.
 Karma arose and fought endlessly.
 If a Primordial Purple Qi really appeared, wouldn’t it be even more chaotic?
 Han Jue was looking forward to it.
 “I’m South Extreme Heavenly Venerate. In a hundred years, I will preach the Dao in the 33rd Heaven. All living beings can come and listen to the lecture. This lecture will decide the next batch of Heavenly Dao Sages!”
 A voice resounded through the world, awakening all the living beings of the Hidden Sect.
 Han Jue frowned.
 He was bragging again!
 Was he trying to trick all living beings?
 Han Jue hesitated. Should he take advantage of the South Extreme Heavenly Venerate’s lecture to curse?
 Forget it. If South Extreme Heavenly Venerate went mad and the listeners were in danger, it would be a huge sin.
 (Empress Nüwa sent you a dream. Do you accept it?]
 A line of words suddenly appeared in front of him.
