 The former Sage Fated Secrets was also considered one of the top existences among Sages. Unfortunately, he had offended Han Jue.
 If not for Sage Fated Secrets bewitching Su Qi, how would he have embarked on a path of no return?
 However, that was karma. Sage Fated Secrets had been cursed by him but was killed by other Sages.
 Han Jue had a deeper understanding of the Sages.
Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m These Sages’ attitudes changed extremely quickly. They could treat you well at one moment and harm you at the next.
 Han Jue couldn’t trust Sages easily.
 He shook his head and stopped thinking about it. He began to cultivate the Grand Unity Aspect.
 Forty-eight years passed.
 Han Jue had grasped a total of fifty Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols until he couldn’t learn new ones.
 The Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols he grasped were respectively: the Lone Star Fiendcelestial, the Inner Direction Fiendcelestial, the Silver Hatred Fiendcelestial, the Great Dao Concealment Fiendcelestial, the Heartless Fiendcelestial, the Transmogrification Fiendcelestial, the Ultimate Yin Fiendcelestial, the Love Fiendcelestial, the Viridescent Nether Fiendcelestial, the Black Sea Fiendcelestial, the Ultimate Fire Fiendcelestial, the Grand Desolate Fiendcelestial, the Past Injury Fiendcelestial, the Great Chiliocosm Fiendcelestial, the Subspace Fiendcelestial, the Heavenly Devil Fiendcelestial, the Restless Fiendcelestial, the Single Thought Fiendcelestial, the Eighteen Sun Moon Fiendcelestial, the Illusion Fiendcelestial, the Divine Fiendcelestial, the Spirit Qi Fiendcelestial, the Origin Sand Fiendcelestial, the False Reality Fiendcelestial, the Destiny Fiendcelestial, the Ultimate Origin Fiendcelestial, the Extreme Minute Fiendcelestial, the Earth Fiend Fiendcelestial, the Vitality Fiendcelestial, the Voltige Fiendcelestial, the Great Emperor Fiendcelestial, the Curse Fiendcelestial, the Imprisonment Fiendcelestial, the Primal Demon Fiendcelestial, the Taotie Fiendcelestial, the Magus Fiendcelestial, the Myriad Treasure Fiendcelestial, the Fake Truth Fiendcelestial, the Four Seasons Fiendcelestial, the Madness Fiendcelestial, the Evil Fiendcelestial, the Zither Music Fiendcelestial, the Undying Fiendcelestial, the Indestructible Fiendcelestial, the Guardian Fiendcelestial, the Wall Barrier Fiendcelestial, the Universe Fiendcelestial, the Giant Fiendcelestial, the Heavenly Charge Fiendcelestial, and the Omniscient Fiendcelestial.
 He had accumulated a total of 124 Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols!
 Han Jue had his own understanding. He felt that the source of everything might be the Chaotic Fiendcelestial. Perhaps this was the inheritance.
 Even if the Chaotic Fiendcelestials were already legends, they were everywhere in the world.
 Then, Han Jue entered the simulation trial.
 He first attacked Dao Heavenly Devil.
 As his understanding of the Great Dao of Extreme Origin deepened, he felt that he could fuse with the Grand Unity Aspect. He didn’t have to fight in groups.
 If he could gather the power of all the Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols and kill the enemy in one go, that would be even better!
 Han Jue first summoned 124 Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols and destroyed the Dao Heavenly Devil with absolute violence.
 The Dao Heavenly Devil only lasted for ten breaths of time.
 Han Jue began to try to fuse the power of the 124 Chaotic Fiendcelestials in battle. This process was very difficult because the power of the Great Dao was on par with each other.
 Just like that, Han Jue was immersed in the simulation trial.
 After bullying the Dao Heavenly Devil for half a year, Han Jue could already easily insta-kill him.
 He began to challenge Dijun.
 Then…
 He was blown up.
 Not convinced, he continued to challenge Dijun.
 After hundreds of challenges, Han Jue almost became depressed.
 He changed opponents again.
 Ancestor Xitian this time.
 He was completely depressed.
 These two were too impressive.
 Han Jue began to set up the simulation trial. He set Qiu Xilai, Li Muyi, the South Extreme Heavenly Venerate, Sect Master Tian Jue, Sage Jin’an, Fuxitian, Emperor Xiao, and Sage Fated Secrets as his opponents.
 One against eight!
 Too close!
 They were easily suppressed!
 The eight Sages had tacit understanding when they joined forces, but Han Jue had even more Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols. They were all destroyed in less than ten breaths of time.
 Han Jue’s Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols could already sever the Heavenly Dao’s providence!
 Apart from the increase in the number of Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols, it was also related to his cultivation. Although he had only broken through a minor realm, there was a huge difference.
 Above the Sage Realm, every minor realm was enough to determine the strength!
 After nearly a hundred simulation trials, Han Jue finally found a way to insta-kill the eight Sages.
 “Awesome!”
 This time, Han Jue could finally look down on Sages.
 In the future, if any Sage dared to speak to him coldly, they would be asking for a beating!
 In a good mood, Han Jue decided to go out and relax.
 Currently, under the Heavenly Dao, he was already invincible. He could relax a little.
 Han Jue decided to visit his son.
 There was a vast amount of Heavenly Dao Merit hidden in the Primordial World. He could resist the Heavenly Dao’s rejection as long as he wrapped it around his body. Of course, if he used the power of a Sage, the Heavenly Dao would still forcefully expel him.
 The other Heavenly Dao Sages couldn’t do this because they relied on the Heavenly Dao’s providence. If they entered the Immortal World without permission, the Heavenly Dao inside and outside would reject them. It would be even more uncomfortable.
 South Dun Region, Human Race, Moon Heart City.
 Han Tuo was watching the battle below at the battle arena.
 Moon Heart City occupied an area of thousands of kilometers and was considered one of the largest cities in the human race in this region. The cultivation culture was dense and there was more than one such battle arena.
 The two cultivators fighting on the platform were Grand Unity Earth Immortals. Even with the restriction isolating their Dharmic powers, the nearby people and cultivators were still shocked.
 “Do you find it interesting to watch them fight with your cultivation level?”
 A voice suddenly came from the side. Han Tuo turned around and saw an extremely ugly monk smiling at him.
 It was Han Jue. He came to see his son in Xun Chang’an’s past ugly appearance.
 Han Tuo frowned. “Who are you?”
 He had just become an Immortal Emperor not long ago. No one in the entire Moon Heart City could match him, but he couldn’t see through this ugly monk in front of him.
 Han Ming had once told him that he had to be careful of Buddhist cultivators.
 Han Jue smiled. “I see that your providence is extraordinary, so I want to get to know you. I’m Crouching Dragon. People call me Young Phoenix. You can also call me Young Phoenix Crouching Dragon. What about you, young friend?”
 Young Phoenix? Han Tuo frowned. He had never heard of this name.
 However, since the other party had no ill intentions, he couldn’t slap a smiling face.
 “I’m Han Tuo.”
 “Young friend, you don’t have a sect at your cultivation level?”
 “There are no sects or schools. The Immortal World is just a speck of dust.”
 “Oh? Do you want me to introduce you to a major faction?”
 “How big is it?”
 “How big do you want it to be?”.
 “Have you heard of Li Daokong?”
 Han Jue blinked and said, “I did. You want to join the Human School?”
 Han Tuo shook his head. “I want to join the Hidden Sect and become the disciple of that Immeasurable Merit Divine Might Heavenly Sage. No, I can even take him as my grandmaster. Unfortunately, my cultivation level is too weak. It’s said that the Hidden Sect has countless Immortal Emperors.”
 A woman beside him looked at Han Jue and his son in surprise.
 Such bragging!
 He called himself an Immortal Emperor!
 He even mentioned the Immeasurable Merit Divine Might Heavenly Sage.
 The woman’s eyes revealed disdain.
 Han Jue said, “The Hidden Sect is too difficult. I can’t do it. How about the Heavenly Race?”
 Han Tuo was surprised. This ugly monk really had a way?
 He shook his head. “The Heavenly Race belongs to the Immortal Gods. I don’t want to enter.”
 Han Jue was interested. This kid hated immortals?
 Just as he was about to ask, a line of words suddenly appeared in front of him.
 [Detected bearer of Connate providence, check its origin.]
 Han Jue was stunned.
 It had been a long time since such a notification appeared. Ever since he had attained the Dao, even if it was the reincarnation of a Sage, it might not be able to catch the system’s attention.
 He immediately chose to check.
