 Was this the passage of time?
 As he read, not many emails attracted Han Jue’s attention.
 He was most interested in when Li Daokong would be severely injured.
 Facing the attack of the Pseudo-Sage Jiang Dugu, he was not severely injured. Perhaps the disciples of the Human School were sparring. “Li Daokong wanted to take me in as his disciple so much, but I actually wanted to see him crippled?”
 Han Jue was secretly ashamed and felt that his thinking was not right.
 Currently, the Immortal World was filled with all sorts of people. The various forces were interconnected and no one could see who could win the providence of the calamity for the time being.
 After reading the emails, Han Jue called the eight brothers out.
 Han One and Han Seven were both Earth Immortal Gourd Spirits. Han Eight’s potential was even more outstanding. He was a Chaotic Gourd Spirit. The eight brothers had been cultivating in seclusion on Hidden Sect Island, but their cultivation time was shorter. They couldn’t enter the top ten in the Hidden Sect Competition, including Han Eight.
 Han Jue wanted to guide them. After all, they were surnamed Han and were equivalent to his sons.
 The eight brothers of the Han family were very nervous. Han Jue hadn’t seen them alone for a long time.
 “What Mystical Power do you want to learn?” Han Jue asked. Now, he had dozens of Mystical Powers and more spells. This was still the case when he was too lazy to create them himself. It was enough for him to teach the disciples.
 Han Eight was the first to speak. “I want to learn the strongest Mystical Power!”
 As soon as he finished speaking, Han One glared at him, scaring him so much that he hurriedly lowered his head.
 The other brothers became nervous, afraid that they would anger Han Jue.
 Han Jue was expressionless and laughed in his heart.
 It seemed that the hundred-year competition had caused the inner circle of the Hidden Sect to be a little tense. This was a good thing. After all, other than who was stronger and who was weaker, these people had no other worries. If there was no pressure, how could they advance?
 Han Jue thought for a moment and said, “Then, I’ll teach you the Five Elements Divine Light. When this Mystical Power is cultivated to the extreme, there’s nothing it can’t do. All techniques can be broken. I hope that you can bring this Mystical Power to greater heights.” Hearing this, the eight brothers immediately became excited. They kowtowed and thanked Han Jue.
 Half a year later.
 They left the cave abode and were surrounded by others. They were all curious about the Mystical Power they had learned.
 Regarding this, the eight brothers were as mysterious as Li Yao. “You’ll know in the next competition!”
 Apart from Han Eight, the other gourds were all smug
 The Black Hell Chicken almost died of anger. “When will it be my turn? I’m the most obedient one!”
 Xun Chang’an said angrily, “Wasn’t the previous Vermilion Bird a reward?” Zhou Mingyue, the reincarnated Great Sage Equaling Heaven, and Lu Huaxu, the reincarnated Purple Star Emperor, nodded.
 They were the disciples who were not taken care of!
 However, due to their low seniority, they couldn’t take the initiative to look for Han Jue.
 Under the Fusang Tree, the Chaotic Heavenly Dog wagged its tail and said lazily, “We have to do it by generation. The eight of them are surnamed Han. Are you also surnamed Han?”
 Zhou Mingyue shouted, “From today onwards, my name is Han Mingyue!”
 Lu Huaxu covered his face. He couldn’t be as shameless as Zhou Mingyue.
 Tu Ling’er curled her lips and said, “I’ll definitely be next!”
 The Golden Crow Ah Da couldn’t take it anymore and said, “Why is it you again? You’ve already gone in a few times!”
 Everyone began to argue. Of course, most of them were joking and were not really jealous.
 They were under Han Jue’s protection, anyway.
 Duan Hongchen sat in a corner and frowned. It was unknown what he was thinking.
 In a crimson hall, Di Lantian, who had transformed into a human, sat on an Emperor’s throne.
 Long Hao brought the seven mighty figures of the True Dragon Race into the hall. On both sides were the elders of the Golden Crow Divine Clan.
 The imposing Di Lantian sized up Long Hao, and a hint of surprise flashed across his eyes. Long Hao stopped and cupped his fists with a smile. “I’m the Dragon Emperor of the Dragon Court. Greetings to the Golden Crow Divine Clan’s leader!”
 Di Lantian glanced at the seven people behind him and said casually, “You’ve already received the help of the True Dragon Race. Why are you looking for me? Could it be that you still want to join forces with me?”
 The Golden Crow Divine Clan and the True Dragon Race were not on good terms. The Golden Crows were known to feed on dragons. How could the True Dragon Race tolerate this?
 The two races often fought and were considered mortal enemies.
 Long Hao stared at Di Lantian and said, “This Immortal World is already the main chessboard of the Heavenly Dao. You and I are both pawns, but if we join forces, we can become chess players. I heard that the Golden Crow Divine Clan has awakened the Emperor Ancestral Bell. You don’t want to be pawns, right?”
 Di Lantian said disdainfully, “Since you already know about the Emperor Ancestral Bell, why do you dare to come?”
 He raised his right hand and waved it gently. The terrifying and mighty Emperor Ancestral Bell suddenly appeared in the sky. It was like a grand mountain floating in the air, and it could crash down at any moment.
 Long Hao did not seem to see the Emperor Ancestral Bell above his head. He smiled and said, “Can the Emperor Ancestral Bell suppress Sages?”
 Di Lantian’s expression darkened.
 “I want to overthrow the Heavenly Court. I want to be the Heavenly Emperor. I’m willing to be one of the two Emperors of the Heavenly Court with you, just like the Four Extreme Emperors of the Heavenly Court. You control the heavens and I control the earth. How about that?” Long Hao said with a burning gaze.
 Di Lantian asked, “Could it be that the Heavenly Emperor doesn’t want to pass the throne to you? You’re already his strongest son.”
 “He doesn’t want to be accused of favoritism, and he also obeys the Sages. He thinks that the next Heavenly Emperor should be a mortal.”
 “Oh? Which mortal? The Three Great Generals seem to be from the Human Race, right?”
 “That’s right. Since you already understand, you don’t have to suspect my motives, right?”
 “But, are you qualified?”
 Di Lantian shook his head and did not take Long Hao seriously.
 In his opinion, Long Hao was too young.
 He was only a few thousand years old. It was even shorter than a nap. “He’s not qualified, then what about me?!”
 A dignified voice came from Long Hao’s body. Golden dragon aura overflowed from his body and quickly condensed into a golden figure. It was Hao Tian!
 Di Lantian was moved. He narrowed his eyes and said, “Hao Tian! I didn’t expect Senior to still be alive!”
 Hao Tian said, “Since you still call me senior, are you willing to cooperate? I want to deal with the one behind the Heavenly Court!”
 “No problem!”
 Di Lantian immediately agreed.
 Hao Tian smiled and said, “You can talk to him.”
 He dissipated into smoke.
 Long Hao’s tightly clenched fists loosened. He was only pretending to be confident. The pressure of the Emperor Ancestral Bell above his head was no joke.

My clan’s Jiang Yi was saved because he reported it. How’s your master’s cultivation? What’s his cultivation level now?”
 Long Hao smiled and said, “I’m not sure, either. But I heard from my father that my master should be only five thousand years old now. With his potential, he’s at least a Rank Five Immortal Emperor.”
 Di Lantian’s pupils constricted as he sighed. “To be able to reach the Rank Five Immortal Emperor Realm at five thousand years old, such talent is even stronger than Dao Sovereign of the Divine Palace. No, it should be the Heavenly Court’s Dao Sovereign now.”
 Long Hao’s eyes revealed reverence. “My master didn’t enter the calamity, but his talent is top-notch. In the future, he will be the top mighty figure in the world. He will also become the pillar of our new Heavenly Court.”
