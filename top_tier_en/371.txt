 Han Jue cursed silently. The more he looked at Greedy Lord, the more he disliked him.
 This fellow had actually become like him in the future. It was simply unforgivable!
 Han Jue had to kill him!
 Now, this kid came knocking on his door.
 Under Han Jue’s gaze, Greedy Lord kept muttering strange incantations. The power of the curse kept attacking Han Jue. Very weak!
 Han Jue felt that it was almost impossible for him to even catch a cold from the curse.
 Soon, the scene shattered and Han Jue returned to the Connate Cave Abode.
 He was secretly puzzled. The current Greedy Lord didn’t even have any hatred towards him. Why did he curse him?
 Could it be that it was like Xue Minghe who directly cursed the entire Heavenly Court?
 That shouldn’t be the case. How could this fellow be so capable?
 Unknowingly, the Six Mystic Divine Origin was also a weakling in Han Jue’s eyes.
 He wondered if he should derive the reason.
 Forget it!
 In any case, the future had already changed. The Heavenly Emperor could still live until the end of the calamity. Han Jue couldn’t be bothered to care why Greedy Lord cursed him.
 I’ll give him ten billion years first!
 Han Jue didn’t curse immediately but waited for the curse to end.
 After about five minutes, Greedy Lord stopped cursing him.
 Han Jue continued to wait.
 Ten years later. Han Jue stopped cultivating and took out the Book of Misfortune directly, then started to curse Greedy Lord.
 After all, curses were sustainable. If he reversed the curse when Greedy Lord cursed him, he might very well tell Immortal Emperor Samsara that he was the Dark Forbidden Lord, causing his identity to be exposed.
 Han Jue knew his limits. The hatred of the Dark Forbidden Lord was too great. He was undoubtedly the number one in the Immortal World.
 Five days later.
 Han Jue’s lifespan began to decrease. He cursed with all his might.
 How could a mere Six Mystic Divine Origin block the curse containing ten billion years of lifespan?
 In the dark cave abode, Greedy Lord’s body twisted violently as if there were energies running rampant. His expression was extremely ugly.
 He began to bleed from his seven apertures and his eyes were bloodshot. “Damn it, who cursed me?” Greedy Lord was furious. The first people he thought of were not Han Jue, but Ji Xianshen and Fang Liang.
 Recently, he had been following these two and had secretly killed many of their enemies. It was naturally possible to offend powerful enemies.
 Greedy Lord was furious.
 It was all Immortal Emperor Samsara’s fault for not treating him as a human!
 He always made him do these dirty and tiring types of work!
 At this moment, the curse power became stronger and stronger. Greedy Lord couldn’t be bothered with anger and was filled with fear. He tried his best to resist the curse power.
 Several hours later.
 Boom!
 His body exploded into pools of blood. His soul trembled and was still circulating his energy to resist.
 He couldn’t hold on much longer!
 Greedy Lord suddenly looked up and rushed out of the cave abode.
 Outside the cave was a magnificent mountain range. He flew into the sky and traversed millions of kilometers in the blink of an eye, quickly arriving in front of a lake.
 Ji Xianshen and Fang Liang were meditating by the lake. Sensing his aura, they stood up and prepared to fight.
 “Tell Immortal Emperor Samsara! Someone cursed me!”
 “Ahhh-“
 Just as Greedy Lord finished speaking, his soul couldn’t withstand the explosion of his Divine Origin. His body and soul were destroyed.
 Ji Xianshen and Fang Liang were stunned. They were baffled.
 They didn’t know him.
 The two of them looked at each other. Ji Xianshen sighed. “It’s the Dark Forbidden Lord again. This person is really pitiful.”
 Fang Liang’s expression was solemn. He clearly felt that Greedy Lord was not simple. He was at least at the Deity Realm.
 A mighty Deity Realm cultivator was actually cursed to death!
 How strong was the Dark Forbidden Lord?
 Fang Liang said seriously, “Let’s not talk about this. The Dark Forbidden Lord is very powerful. If we tell him, he will probably target us.”
 Hearing this, Ji Xianshen couldn’t help but shiver.
 The fates of the Demon Emperor, the Heavenly Dao Buddha, Zu Tu, and Greedy Lord were still vivid in his mind. He didn’t want to be targeted by the Dark Forbidden Lord. He nodded and decided to hide it.
 Inside the Connate Cave Abode.
 Han Jue’s lifespan had already decreased by four billion years when he suddenly felt the power of the curse vanish.
 It was as if he had lost his target.
 Could it be that Greedy Lord was dead?
 Han Jue couldn’t see the notification from the email and couldn’t help but ask.
 [Greedy Lord has been destroyed in body and soul.]
 This time, his lifespan was not deducted.
 Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief and put away the Book of Misfortune in satisfaction.
 According to the plot of an ordinary novel, Greedy Lord was definitely a potential enemy of the protagonist. Unfortunately, he encountered a protagonist like Han Jue.
 I won’t give you a chance to develop or show off. I’ll strangle you to death!
 Without Greedy Lord, what would Tai Sutian do?
 Han Jue started to adjust his state and checked the recent emails.
 [Your good friend Li Daokong was cursed by a mysterious curse. Because he has a Supreme Treasure, he is not affected.] [Your Dao Companion Xing Hongxuan has learned a Mystical Power and comprehended the Heavenly Dao.]
 (Your good friend Han Ming received guidance from a mysterious mighty figure. His cultivation has increased greatly.] [Your good friend Heavenly Emperor has become a person facing the calamity.]
 [Your good friend Huang Zuntian has obtained the providence of the Jie School and had his providence increase greatly.)
 (Your good friend Divine General was attacked by the Divine Palace’s Immortal Emperor] x134
 (Your good friend Pan Xin was attacked by the Master of the Immeasurable Calamity and was severely injured.)
 [Your disciple Long Hao has received the inheritance of your enemy Li Xuan’ao. His Sword Dao has increased greatly.]
 The Heavenly Emperor had become someone facing the calamity!
 Han Jue only frowned slightly and was not surprised. It would be strange if he was not someone facing the calamity. However, the number of people who could face the calamity was indeed strange. For a weakling like Zhou Fan to become one, could it be that there was a Sage plotting behind the scene?
 Han Jue felt that it was very likely. The Heavenly Dao was impartial, so there must be a reason why it was biased now.
 Looking down, why was Pan Xin this old fellow attacked again?
 It shouldn’t be in the Nine Nether Purgatory. Otherwise, it was impossible for Han Li to not sense it.
 There was also Li Xuan’ao. He actually took the opportunity to guide Long Hao.
 What was he doing? Han Jue smelled a conspiracy. The Heavenly Emperor had said that Long Hao had betrayed him.
 The thoughts of the two disciples were unfathomable.
 Han Jue continued reading. The Heavenly Court was still peaceful. Only a few immortals were attacked, and even curses were rare.
 Several months later.
 Liu Bei finally returned.
 Han Jue moved him into the Connate Cave Abode.
 Liu Bei looked unscathed.
 “Why did you take so long?” Han Jue frowned and asked. He almost thought that Liu Bei was dead.
 Liu Bei said helplessly, “There’s nothing I can do about the delay in the Heavenly Court. I heard from the Immortal God who sent the pills that there’s a drastic change in the Heavenly Court.”
 Change?
 Han Jue was puzzled. Didn’t the Heavenly Court not start a war? What other changes were there?
 He accepted the Dao Pills and let Liu Bei out.
 Han Jue put the bottle aside and took out the Heavenly Dao Token to contact the Heavenly Emperor.
 However, the Heavenly Emperor did not answer.
Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates What happened?
 Han Jue panicked. He checked his interpersonal relationships and saw that the Heavenly Emperor’s portrait was still there. “Let’s wait and see.”
 Han Jue forcefully suppressed his worry.
 Five years later.
 Han Jue contacted the Heavenly Emperor again.
 This time, the Heavenly Emperor quickly contacted him with his divine sense. Before he could speak, the Heavenly Emperor suddenly said, “Don’t contact me anymore.” Han Jue’s heart tightened when he heard that. He asked carefully, “Your Majesty, what’s wrong?”
 The Heavenly Emperor sighed and said faintly, “A Sage has tampered with the providence of the Heavenly Court and me. My fate is already in chaos. You can’t be involved in my karma anymore. Otherwise, if the calamity descends, you will be implicated no matter where you hide.”
