 Thousand Madness Devil shook his head firmly.
 The Sage was silent and did not say anything else.
 After Thousand Madness Devil left, the dark clouds above the Hundred Peak Immortal River suddenly dispersed.
 Han Jue didn’t attack after seeing him leave.
 Since the other party was tactful, so be it.
 Han Jue wasn’t afraid that the other party would attack. The array formation of the Dao Field had already been upgraded to the Freedom Sage level. Who was he afraid of?
 “After the Three Pure Sacred Ancestor was defeated, who still dares to invade? The other party is a Pseudo-Sage, so it’s impossible for him to be ignorant. Someone must have planned behind his back and took out something that made him willing to take the risk.”
 Han Jue thought silently.
 The only thing that could move a Pseudo-Sage was the Primordial Purple Qi.
 Could it be that the Sages were swindling someone again?
 Calculate!
 Han Jue immediately used the system to deduce. “I want to know who made Thousand Madness Devil come here.”
 (4 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 A figure appeared in Han Jue’s mind.
 It was him!
 Qiu Xilai!
 Han Jue frowned. He was clearly on good terms with him. Why was he so impatient to scheme against him?
 From his understanding of Qiu Xilai, he was not as reckless as he looked.
 “I want to know why Qiu Xilai asked Thousand Madness Devil to find trouble with me.”
 (Ten billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Ten billion years of lifespan!
 This was no longer the value of a Heavenly Dao Sage!
 Han Jue was interested. Was there a new enemy?
 He chose to continue!
 He entered the illusion.
 This was Qiu Xilai’s Dao Field. The golden Buddha Qiu Xilai was motionless like a statue.
 Han Jue landed in the hall and looked at him.
 It had to be said that Qiu Xilai’s image was really holy. It was difficult to think that he was an evil existence at first glance. It was as if he represented the righteousness of the Great Kindness.
 Qiu Xilai suddenly opened his eyes.
 He asked, “Who?”
 Han Jue looked around and didn’t see anyone. He couldn’t help but be shocked. Was Qiu Xilai talking about him?
 That was too terrifying!
 Qiu Xilai frowned. “This aura fluctuation… No, it’s not an aura, but the providence of the Heavenly Dao.”
 He was immediately moved and asked in surprise, “Heavenly Dao? Dao Ancestor?”
 A cold voice sounded, “The Heavenly Dao is abnormal. I hope that the Sages can save the Heavenly Dao.”
 Han Jue was stunned. What?
 Heavenly Dao?
 Qiu Xilai frowned and asked, “Are you the Heavenly Dao or the Dao Ancestor?”
 “Everything can have a spirit. Why can’t the Heavenly Dao? The Dao Ancestor has long left. The Heavenly Dao is the Heavenly Dao.”
 The cold voice sounded again, causing Qiu Xilai to be moved.
 Han Jue was shocked.
 The Heavenly Dao had intelligence. How could that be?
 Wasn’t the Heavenly Dao impartial?
 Wasn’t the Heavenly Dao emotionless and would not side with anyone?
 If the Heavenly Dao had its own intelligence, wouldn’t it be easy to develop its own emotions and judgment?
 Not to mention Han Jue, even Qiu Xilai felt his blood run cold.
 The reason why they, the Sages, were high and mighty was that the Heavenly Dao was superficial and would not control them.
 Now…
 Qiu Xilai’s expression was ugly. “What do you want to do?”
 The Heavenly Dao replied, “Remove the anomaly and restore order.”
 “Who’s the anomaly?”
 “Newly promoted Sage, Han Jue.”
 “The Dao Ancestor said that he’s a variable…”
 “Variables are variables. Because of him, the last Immeasurable Calamity ended very quickly.”
 Qiu Xilai’s face turned ashen.
 The scene shattered.
 Han Jue’s consciousness returned to reality. His heart was in chaos.
 “I want to know if the Heavenly Dao has developed intelligence.”
 (Ten billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [Yes]
 Han Jue’s heart turned cold.
 “Can the Heavenly Dao kill me?”
 (Ten billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 (The Heavenly Dao does not have the ability to attack on its own for the time being. It can only communicate with living beings.]
 I see.
 No wonder it came to find Qiu Xilai.
 Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief.
 “Does Qiu Xilai think that I’m the Dark Forbidden Lord?”
 (4 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 (Yes]
 Damn it!
 Han Jue frowned. He immediately wanted to kill him.
 However, on second thought, even if Qiu Xilai thought so, the other Sages might not believe him.
 Moreover, even if the Sages believed it, what could they do to him?
 As long as Han Jue didn’t leave the Dao Field, the Sages and the Heavenly Dao wouldn’t be able to harm him!
 “How annoying. I don’t want to attract attention, but people keep finding trouble with me.”
 Han Jue sighed helplessly.
 Focus on cultivating and surpassing the Heavenly Dao as soon as possible. When the time came, he would capture the Heavenly Dao and make it his pet!
 In the netherworld, Underworld.
 Yang Tiandong sat in the hall and yawned in boredom.
 The two rows of ghost servants did not move. The Black and White Deities escorted another soul that had committed sins.
 Those who could enter the hall and be interrogated were all people who had committed sins when they were alive. Their negative karma was deep. When ordinary living beings died, they would directly go to the Bridge of Forgetfulness.
 Yang Tiandong looked at the souls in the hall and was stunned.
 The soul held by the Black and White Deities was Han Jue’s son, Han Tuo.
 Yang Tiandong was one of the few people who had seen Han Jue’s true appearance. Looking at Han Tuo’s handsome face, he seemed to see Han Jue in a daze.
 No one in the world could compare to Han Jue.
 Yang Tiandong frowned and asked, “What’s your name? Tell me your birth.”
 Han Tuo’s expression was ugly as he said in a low voice, “My name is Han Tuo. I was born in the Human Race. I’m not about to die, but my soul was extracted by someone using a spell and I was thrown into the netherworld.”
 Yang Tiandong asked, “What are your parents’ names?”
 Han Tuo hesitated for a moment and then said, “My father’s name is Han Jue and my mother’s name is Qingluan’er. King of Hell, I’m really innocent. My lifespan is still intact. I’ve understood that in my situation, the netherworld shouldn’t interfere!”
 After so many years, his parents were already dead. It was fine to say it.
 The White Deity cursed, “How dare you! How dare you order the King of Hell?” “Shut up!”
 Yang Tiandong slapped the table and shouted angrily, scaring the Black and White Deities and Han Tuo.
 “Your father’s name is Han Jue… How is that possible!”
 Yang Tiandong’s expression changed in disbelief.
 What a coincidence!
 This child looked very similar to Han Jue, and his father had the same name…
 Yang Tiandong pinched his fingers to deduce and discovered that he couldn’t deduce the karma of Han Tuo’s father.
 Could it be…
 Yang Tiandong said in a low voice, “Black and White Deities, leave!”
 Hearing this, the Black and White Deities looked at each other and hurriedly floated out of the hall.
 Nervous, Han Tuo frowned, not knowing why Yang Tiandong had lost his composure.
 Yang Tiandong asked, “Can you tell me about your parents?”
 Han Tuo was silent.
 Ever since he was young, he had felt that his parents were extraordinary, especially his mother. She had even taught him his body tempering technique. Until now, he had thought that he could be where he was today all because of that body tempering technique.
 There was no other way. Han Tuo could only tell the truth. Otherwise, he would reincarnate and everything would turn into smoke.
 He still had to take revenge!
 He couldn’t let this go!
 Thus, Han Tuo began to talk about life when he was young.
 The more Yang Tiandong listened, the more shocked he became.
 This Han Jue’s temperament was too similar to his master.
 It was the same… cowardice…
 No.. he was just as cautious!Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels
