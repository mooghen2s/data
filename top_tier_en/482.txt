 The living beings who could speak in human language began to communicate and motivate each other. They were all leaders who did not submit to the Ancient Fiendish Yin.
 Seeing that the situation was unstable, Ancient Fiendish Yin snorted.
 This cold snort was like a hammer striking the hearts of all the Connate lifeforms.
 Ancient Fiendish Yin’s figure suddenly distorted and quickly rose like a huge mountain. It rose higher and higher, quickly covering the sky.
 The Connate lifeforms in the wasteland seemed tiny in front of Ancient Fiendish Yin.
 The huge turtle that had been shouting shut up and shivered.
 Ancient Fiendish Yin looked up, and his gaze passed through the 33rd Heaven.
 “No matter who it is, no one can stop me from attaining the Dao!” Ancient Fiendish Yin muttered with a firm tone.
 Before the calamity arrived, Sages could not enter the Immortal World. He was an invincible existence among all living beings!
 Fifty years later.
 Empress Houtu sent a dream to Han Jue.
 He entered the dream. It was still the Yellow Spring. Empress Houtu went straight to the point and revealed her intentions.
 The order of reincarnation had just been restored. Because of the Dao Destruction Mystical Power, the netherworld was almost wiped out. Empress Houtu wanted to recruit ghost soldiers and ghost deities for the netherworld. She didn’t trust the other factions and hoped that Han Jue would help.
 Han Jue was secretly vigilant.
 He pretended to be troubled. “That’s not good. Our Hidden Sect only wants to cultivate in a low-profile manner and not enter the calamity. The Nether Race established it previously to not enter the calamity. After so many years, even if I let them out, they might not want to.”
 Empress Houtu said, “Try. I’m not asking them to enter the calamity. I’m only here to control the order of the netherworld.”
 Han Jue said, “Why don’t you cooperate with the Heavenly Court, Empress? My grand-disciple is the Heavenly Emperor. The Heavenly Court is weak and needs allies.”
 “It’s not impossible,” Empress Houtu said in a low voice, making Han Jue heave a sigh of relief.
 He had finally dealt with it!
 Afraid that Empress Houtu would go back on her word, Han Jue quickly changed the topic. “What do you think of the Ancient Race, Empress?”
 “Ancient Fiendish Yin has great ambitions, but whether he can succeed depends on how he leads the Ancient Race. The various factions will not sit and wait for death. War will break out in the Immortal World soon. If there are wars, there will be ghosts. This is also the reason why I need your help.”
 Hearing Empress Houtu’s words, Han Jue was speechless.
 Why did she come back to this again?
 Empress Houtu began to pour out her grievances, saying how important Reincarnation was and how much she lacked manpower.
 Han Jue also complained about how tough life was. He said that it was not easy to cultivate diligently and that one had to endure loneliness. Once he came out of seclusion, he would be affected by his desire for power and would rebound. It was very difficult for him to return to his cultivation state.
 After a long time.
 The two of them finished chatting and the dream ended.
 In the Daoist temple, Han Jue took out the Heavenly Dao Token and started to contact Fang Liang. When Fang Liang heard that he wanted to cooperate with Empress Houtu, he immediately agreed. The Heavenly Court needed a reliable ally.
 The structure of the Heavenly Race was too complicated. Even Ji Xianshen couldn’t completely control it. The Heavenly Court still needed other forces to support it.
 Empress Houtu was not a Heavenly Dao Sage, but she was equivalent to one. She was suitable for the Heavenly Court.
 Fang Liang was very grateful to Han Jue and thought that he was helping him pave the way. Han Jue couldn’t be bothered to explain the situation.
 Putting down the Heavenly Dao Token, he frowned.
 No!
 The next time he preached the Dao, he had to instill in everyone in the Hidden Sect his philosophy not to be attracted by the mortal world.
 Two hundred years later, Han Jue began to preach.
 This was also the first time Long Hao and Hao Tian heard him preach the Dao. They were looking forward to it.
 In less than a few days, Hao Tian was shocked.
 Han Jue was actually preaching the Great Dao!
 Only Sages could talk about the Great Dao!
 I knew it!
 He was definitely an ancient cultivator comparable to Ancestor Xitian!
 Excited, Hao Tian began to listen carefully.
 He had also heard Sages preach the Great Dao and had also cultivated the Great Dao, but he had failed. Before he died, his cultivation level had stagnated and his progress in Dao comprehension had not been high.
 As he listened, Hao Tian was pleasantly surprised to find that Han Jue’s Great Dao was easier to understand than the Great Dao taught by the Sages.
 Not only was it easier to understand, but it was also more unfathomable.
 This feeling of conflict appeared!
 Han Jue was definitely an existence that surpassed the Heavenly Dao Sage!
 He had to stay in the Hidden Sect in the future!
 Hao Tian silently made up his mind.
 The current him no longer had any desire for power. He only wanted to attain the Dao.
 He could do anything as long as he was given hope!
 This lecture lasted for a hundred years.
 After the lecture, everyone was still entranced and could not recover from their shock.
 Being immersed in the vast Great Dao was too comfortable!
 It was more comfortable than any experience in the world!
 If possible, they even wanted to be immersed in it forever.
 Han Jue suddenly shouted like a thunderclap, waking everyone up.
 A terrifying aura erupted from his body and shook the Dao Field. Nine Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols condensed above his head and covered the sky, looking mighty and domineering. Everyone looked at the Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols in a daze.
 They all knew that Han Jue had this Mystical Power. It was their nightmare in the simulation trial. No one could withstand a single blow from the Fiendcelestial Dharma Idol.
 However, this was the first time they had seen nine Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols condense at the same time.
 Hao Tian stared at the nine Fiendcelestials and suddenly thought of the twelve Ancestral Magi from a long time ago.
 This was the spirit of the twelve Ancestral Magi.
 Han Jue said, “The Heavenly Dao has been restarted for thousands of years. Recently, the Ancient Race has appeared. Many people are frustrated and want to go out and adventure. “Today, I will set a rule. Unless you reach the Pseudo-Sage Realm, you are not allowed to leave the Hundred Peak Immortal River unless you have my permission.”
 Everyone was stunned.
 Pseudo-Sage!
 Hao Tian was shocked. So many disciples had to reach the Pseudo-Sage Realm?
 Impossible!
 Wait!
 It was not impossible! The Hidden Sect already had ten thousand Immortal Emperors. In addition to Han Jue’s terrifying cultivation…
 Hao Tian quickened his pace. What kind of inheritance had he joined?
 He noticed that although the Hidden Sect disciples were stunned, everyone’s eyes were filled with confidence.
 Ever since Han Jue created the Great Dao of Extreme Origin, everyone in the Hidden Sect could constantly break through by listening to him preach the Dao, including Fairy Xi Xuan and Chang Yue’er, who had ordinary potential.
 As time passed, the disciples almost forgot that cultivation had shackles.
 They felt that cultivating with Han Jue would allow them to constantly climb to the peak of cultivation!
 “I will definitely be the first existence among the Hidden Sect disciples to reach the Pseudo-Sage Realm. Master, don’t worry. If anyone wants to go out, I will help you teach them a lesson!” Dao Sovereign said proudly.
 The Black Hell Chicken mocked, “You sound like the Eldest Senior Brother. Aren’t you just a few years older than us? In terms of potential, you might not be the strongest!”
 The others replied one after another, most of them joking to ease the atmosphere.
 Han Jue disappeared and returned to the Daoist temple to cultivate.
 Ever since Han Jue set the rule that only Pseudo-Sages were allowed to leave the mountain, a cultivation trend stirred in the Hidden Sect.
 More and more living beings moved around the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 There were even cases of ferocious beasts wanting to barge into the Hundred Peak Immortal River, but they were stopped by the array formation.
 In the blink of an eye.
F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com Eighty years passed.
 On this day, a figure arrived in front of the Hundred Peak Immortal River. He looked at the vast mountains ahead and frowned.
 This person was Jiang Dugu.
 “I really can’t see through him,” Jiang Dugu muttered to himself. He inexplicably thought of the mysterious Dao Field he had encountered in the Nine Nether Purgatory in the last Immeasurable Calamity.
