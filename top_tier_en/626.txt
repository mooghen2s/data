 Han Tuo cursed. His sudden outburst shocked Yi Tian.
 In the past, the two of them had a relationship that made Yi Tian more like his elder brother. After not seeing him for many years, Han Tuo had come to save him again, so he was very humble.
 Yi Tian curled his lips. “This is a chance to become a Sage. I discovered that the Dark Forbidden Zone is more suitable for me than the Immortal World. Here, the strong are the strong, and the weak are the weak. It’s not like the Immortal World. If I win, the other party might have a backing. It’s so frustrating.”
 Han Tuo frowned. “What do you mean? You don’t plan to return?”
 “Why should I go back? In the past, in the Immortal World, I always felt like I had no choice. Although I’m talented, I always feel that something is controlling me from the unknown. After coming to the Dark Forbidden Zone, this feeling disappeared. This is definitely a paradise for experts. They grow up in slaughter and seek opportunities in danger. Han Tuo, don’t you realize that I’ve already reached the Zenith Heaven Realm?” Yi Tian said excitedly. Han Tuo rarely saw him so excited. He had clearly just experienced a soul-stirring pursuit.
 Han Tuo wanted to say, ‘I’ve already reached the Zenith Heaven Realm.’
 Yi Tian continued, “The Immortal World has already formed a fixed hierarchy. The teachings of the Sages are eternal. Even if you and I attain the Dao, we will still be controlled by the Heavenly Dao. Don’t you want to walk your own path?
 “Do You want to continue growing under the contributions of your predecessors?”
 His words touched Han Tuo deeply.
 He thought of his father.
 If he grew up in the Immortal World, it might be very safe, but it was impossible for him to surpass Han Jue.
 If even Han Jue didn’t dare to leave the Heavenly Dao, didn’t that mean that there was an existence stronger than Han Jue outside the Heavenly Dao? Then, there would naturally be stronger opportunities!
 Han Tuo was convinced.
 Yi Tian knew what he was thinking from his eyes. He added, “Kill that beast first and snatch the Primordial Purple Qi. In the future, who among us will reach the perfected Pseudo-Sage Realm first and become a Sage first? How about that!”
 Han Tuo gritted his teeth. “Alright!”
 The two of them began to pursue the dark beast.
 Another thousand years passed.
 Han Jue’s cultivation level had increased a little, but there was still a long way before he could break through.
 He opened his eyes and started to preach the Dao to the Hidden Sect disciples. The Great Dao of Extreme Origin covered them, and hundreds of thousands of disciples immediately entered a state of Dao comprehension.
 He checked his emails as he preached.
 As he read, an email attracted his attention.
 [Your good friend Ancestor Xitian was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure and was expelled from the Heavenly Dao.]
 Ancestor Xitian was expelled from the Heavenly Dao?
 Han Jue’s heart trembled.
 Ancestor Xitian was the strongest protective umbrella of the Heavenly Dao. Previously, when the Dao Heavenly Devil attacked, it had taken advantage of Ancestor Xitian’s departure.
 Was something going to happen next!
 Han Jue looked at the 33rd Heaven and suddenly discovered another Sage.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du, South Extreme Heavenly Venerate, Sect Master Tian Jue, Emperor Xiao, Heavenly Venerate Wufa, Qiu Xilai, Shi Dudao, Li Daokong, and Fang Liang. Other than the Nine Sages, there was also another Sage!
 In other words, there were already ten Sages in the 33rd Heaven!
 Including Han Jue, there were eleven Sages in the Heavenly Dao!
 The reason why Han Jue was not expelled by the Heavenly Dao was that he was born in the Heavenly Dao and had obtained a huge amount of Heavenly Dao merit. Sages outside the Heavenly Dao couldn’t directly descend into the Heavenly Dao unless they suppressed their cultivation realm and exchanged for the Heavenly Dao’s providence to become a Heavenly Dao Sage.

 Han Jue was puzzled.
 From the looks of it, the limit of the Heavenly Dao was not the nine Sages.
 No!
 Why was the providence of the Heavenly Dao so much stronger?
 Han Jue was suddenly moved. Compared to a thousand years ago, the Heavenly Dao’s providence was like a stream turning into a river. It was not even inferior to the Heavenly Dao before the calamity.
 He counted with his fingers and discovered that it was related to Fang Liang.
 Fang Liang’s Heavenly Dao providence was too strong. It was stronger than all the other Heavenly Dao Sages combined.
 Is this kid cheating?
 Han Jue thought of the Dao Ancestor and felt that it was reasonable.
 The current Fang Liang was already completely on the Dao Ancestor’s side. It was normal for him to be supported by the Dao Ancestor.
 Han Jue thought as he explained.
 A hundred years later.
 Han Jue came to the 33rd Heaven. He came to the Sage’s Dao Field and used the simulation trial to test.
 [Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage: Perfected Heavenly Dao Freedom Sage, Immeasurable Emperor, Golden Crow Ancestor, Primordial Heavenly Emperor]
 Heavenly Dao Freedom Sage?
 Han Jue was shocked and immediately left. He came to the Universal Hall and visited Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du.
 After entering the hall, the two of them sat opposite each other.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du sighed. His tone was filled with emotions and helplessness.
 Han Jue asked why he sighed.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “You should have already discovered the new Sage. Originally, this Sage position should have been given to the Great Loose Heaven. However, there is a new arrangement in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End. It’s the Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage. This person is the second person to rise in the calamity after the splitting of the heavens. I have no choice but to call him senior. His brother is an existence comparable to the Great Dao. We Sages have no choice but to give him face.”
 Han Jue asked curiously, “Whose Primordial Purple Qi did you give him?”
 He had always been curious about who the remaining Primordial Purple Qi in the hands of the Sages belonged to. Sage Fated Secrets and Sage Jin’an had died in exchange for Heavenly Venerate Wufa and Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du. Li Muyi had given the Primordial Purple Qi in his possession to Li Daokong. One of the Primordial Purple Qi in Empress Nüwa and Fuxitian had been given to Shi Dudao. The remaining one was nowhere to be seen. The two of them had already died and should not be seen.
 “The Dao Ancestor’s Primordial Purple Qi,” Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said helplessly.
 Dao Ancestor…
 No wonder the Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage could reach the perfected Freedom Sage Realm. No wonder his arrival was silent, and Han Jue, who was in seclusion, couldn’t sense it.
 Han Jue showed a frown.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “This Primordial Purple Qi has been fused by the Dao Ancestor and the Heavenly Dao. It can allow the Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage to maintain a cultivation level that surpasses the Freedom Sage. However, like us, he’s restricted by the Heavenly Dao. After leaving the Heavenly Dao, his cultivation will be affected. It’s said to be freedom, but it’s actually not. It’s just that his cultivation level is as strong as the Freedom Realm.”
 “Why didn’t you keep such a powerful Primordial Purple Qi for yourself?” Han Jue asked in surprise. Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du was also a Freedom Sage and used ordinary Primordial Purple Qi. His cultivation had to be damaged.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du shook his head. “This Primordial Purple Qi is in Ancestor Xitian’s hands. Before the Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage came, Ancestor Xitian left. It’s said that Ancestor Xitian and the elder brother of the Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage are good friends. I can’t have such a relationship.”
 Han Jue frowned.
 He knew that Ancestor Xitian had been expelled from the Heavenly Dao. Could it be that Dijun had attacked him?
 However, was Dijun stronger than Ancestor Xitian?
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du changed the topic. “Fang Liang has recently been roping in the South Extreme Heavenly Venerate, Sect Master Tian Jue, Emperor Xiao, and Qiu Xilai. The situation outside the 33rd Heaven will change.”
 Han Jue narrowed his eyes and stood up. “I’ll go see him.”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du nodded and did not stop him.
 Han Jue went to the Heavenly Dao Palace. The door opened, and Han Jue cautiously activated all his Supreme Treasures.
 After entering the hall, he saw Fang Liang, who was dressed in a white robe and had white hair. His body shone, but it did not completely conceal his true appearance. His expression was indifferent and his temperament was extraordinary, making others not dare to profane him.
