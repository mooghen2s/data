 He stood in Li Daokong’s Daoist temple and was silent for a long time. His emotions turned into a sigh.
 He knew his senior best.
 He was competitive. This trip was said to seek invincibility, but it was actually to defeat Shi Dudao and regain his reputation. Li Xuan’ao wasn’t too worried. He believed in his senior.
 Perhaps Li Daokong wasn’t Shi Dudao’s match now, but as long as he was given time, he would surpass the other party sooner or later.
 Li Xuan’ao stopped thinking and left.
 If he wanted to help his senior, he had to seize the time to cultivate.
 A hundred years passed quickly.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and checked the emails.
 He had endured for a hundred years because he wanted to see what Li Daokong could do.
 (Your disciple Li Daokong was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure.] (Your disciple Li Daokong was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure and was severely injured.)
 (Your good friend Emperor Chen was attacked by your disciple Li Daokong.]
 (Your good friend Pan Xin was attacked by your disciple Li Daokong.)
 (Your good friend Jiang Dugu was attacked by your disciple Li Daokong and was severely injured.)
 Han Jue showed a frown.
 Shi Dudao didn’t develop any feelings for him, causing him to not be able to check on Li Daokong and his situation.
 He could only dream!
 Han Jue immediately used the Dark Nightmare and saw Shi Dudao in the image of the Dark Forbidden Lord.
 The dream was a volcano range. Magma covered the ground like a spider web. The sky was dense with black clouds, making the world extremely oppressive.
 Shi Dudao opened his eyes and saw the black shadow-like Han Jue. He frowned and asked, “Who are you?”
 He was shocked.
 The other party directly pulled him into a dream realm, and he couldn’t block it. This meant that the difference in cultivation between the two was huge.
 Han Jue said in a hoarse voice, “I’m the Dark Forbidden Lord. Your potential is not bad. I choose you.” Shi Dudao frowned. “Why did you choose
 me?”
 Dark Forbidden Lord?!
 The most terrifying mastermind of the previous Immeasurable Calamity!
 Although Shi Dudao didn’t enter the calamity, he often heard the disciples of the other Sages talking about him. After the Heavenly Dao restarted, the Dark Forbidden Lord even targeted the Sages.
 There were rumors that the Dark Forbidden Lord was transformed by a Sage.
 No matter who the Dark Forbidden Lord was, Shi Dudao knew that he was not his match.
 “Be my believer and I will bring you to the Great Dao,” Han Jue said solemnly.
 “Great Dao? What Great Dao? Surpass the Heavenly Dao?”
 “Mm.”
 “What do I need to do for you?”
 “You don’t have to do anything. Wait for the day the darkness descends and you will know what to do.”
 “Hehe.”
 Shi Dudao smiled.
 Han Jue cursed silently. How dare you laugh at me?
 Shi Dudao changed the topic and said, “You can make me a Sage?”
 Han Jue said, “Of course. I have the method to attain the Dao through strength. I also have the Primordial Purple Qi. I even have an even stronger Dao attainment Qi.”
 Shi Dudao was moved.
 Dao attainment had already become his mental demon. The Sages were unwilling to support him in attaining the Dao because he had not submitted to a certain Sage.
 Shi Dudao knew that even if he acknowledged a Sage as his master, the Sage might not let him attain the Dao. Looking back at the past and present, every Sage was the son or eldest personal disciple of the previous Sage. If he had joined the Sage as a Pseudo-Sage, his own Dao heart couldn’t take it.
 “Alright!” Shi Dudao gritted his teeth and said with a determined expression.
 (Shi Dudao has a favorable impression of you. Current favorability: 1 star.)
 One star was enough!
 Han Jue didn’t really want to accept him.
 He raised his right hand, and a beam of light pierced into Shi Dudao’s forehead. It was so fast that Shi Dudao didn’t even have time to react.
 When Shi Dudao woke up, the dream had already ended. A Mystical Power appeared in his mind.
 Great Freedom Heaven Imprisoning Palm!
 Space Mystical Power that could take in the sky with one palm!
 As his cultivation level increased, he could absorb the Heavenly Dao at its strongest!
 Absorption of the Heavenly Dao!
 Shi Dudao was shocked. This Mystical Power…
Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels On the other side.
 (Shi Dudao’s favorability towards you has increased. Current favorability: 5 stars]
 Han Jue was not surprised. His Mystical Power was strong enough. After all, it was a top-notch system.
 He checked his emails again. Indeed, the mysterious mighty figure had changed.
 [Your disciple Li Daokong was attacked by your good friend Shi Dudao and was severely injured.)
 (Your good friend Shi Dudao was attacked by your disciple Li Daokong.]
 Indeed.
 Li Daokong wasn’t Shi Dudao’s match for the time being
 Li Daokong was a peerless genius that was rare in history, but he, Shi Dudao, was also peerlessly talented. He was a Great Dao Inheritor and his cultivation level had reached the limit below the Sages. Li Daokong had the Ten Thousand Life Sword and was indeed unable to defeat him.
 Han Jue suddenly started to look forward to it.
 Which was stronger, the Great Dao Mystical Power, Ten Thousand Life Sword, or the Great Freedom Heaven Imprisoning Palm, which could absorb the Heavenly Dao?
 33rd Heaven, in the chaos.
 Li Muyi, South Extreme Heavenly Venerate, Sect Master Tian Jue, Fuxitian, Emperor Xiao, and Qiu Xilai stood side by side.
 Sect Master Tian Jue asked in a low voice, “What is it? My Sage Sense can’t penetrate it, but I can feel its aura rapidly becoming stronger.”
 The Sages looked at Li Muyi. His cultivation was the highest.
 “Heavenly Devil, Chaotic Heavenly Devil. This devil gathered the negative karma of the calamity and is no longer inferior to a Sage,” Li Muyi said with an ugly expression.
 The Sages couldn’t help but look at Emperor Xiao.
 Emperor Xiao snorted. “Heavenly Devils are not us devils. Our Devil Race is still hidden in the darkness of the 32nd Heaven being tortured by the Heavenly Dao. This treatment is all thanks to the care of the Sages.”
 The Sages weren’t ashamed of his mockery. Instead, they looked at Li Muyi again.
 Li Muyi sighed. “I’m leaving the Heavenly Dao for some time. My Chiliocosm World has shown signs of trouble. I’ll leave this matter to you. If you can’t subdue this thing, the Immortal World will be in danger. Its target is the Immortal World. I can sense its bloodthirsty desire. It’s very hungry and very angry.”
 The expressions of the Sages changed drastically. Without Li Muyi, they had no backbone.
 Qiu Xilai said, “We can’t even see through it. How can we subdue it? Why don’t we find the ancestor?”
 Fuxitian shook his head. “Ancestor left thousands of years ago and has yet to return.”
 Li Muyi’s expression changed, and he suddenly disappeared.
 The Sages weren’t surprised. They already knew Li Muyi’s situation.
 The most important thing now was to deal with this terrifying and unknown Heavenly Devil.
 “The aura of the Sages… Wait for me…”
 At this moment, a horrified voice sounded from the black hole, causing the Sages’ scalps to tingle.
 “Heavenly Dao… You have to hide well. Don’t let me find you. I’ll eat you.”
 The Sages looked at each other and made up their minds. They took out their strongest Dharma treasures and prepared to join forces to suppress it.
 The Heavenly Devil in the black hole laughed crazily. “A bunch of puppets, the fools in the Heavenly Dao illusion. All of you dare to attack me, you don’t know your limits!”
