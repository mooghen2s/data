 Being suppressed by the Great Dao power of the 74 Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols, the Dao Heavenly Devil couldn’t withstand it at all.
 The Dao Heavenly Devil’s body was torn apart and quickly recovered. This cycle repeated again and again. During this process, his aura quickly weakened.
 The Dao Heavenly Devil would die as long as Han Jue suppressed him like this!
 Even though he knew this, Han Jue didn’t dare to let his guard down.
 The 33rd Heaven was frozen. There was dark blue ice as far as the eye could see. Countless Heavenly Devils were struggling to break out of the ice, but other than the Dao Heavenly Devil, how could the other Heavenly Devils resist Han Jue’s great Dharmic powers?
 Han Jue slowly rose to the sky above all the Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols. Looking down at the battle, his Sage Sense swept in all directions to guard against the two Dharma Idols of the Dao Heavenly Devil.
 All sorts of Great Dao power landed on the Dao Heavenly Devil’s broken body. All sorts of strange lights shone. They were refracted by the extreme ice of the 33rd Heaven. The entire 33rd Heaven fell into a strange and mysterious dream.
 The Sages did not let down their guard. They waited solemnly and stared at the Dao Heavenly Devil, afraid that he would suddenly erupt.
 The Dao Heavenly Devil’s self-healing ability far exceeded that of the other Heavenly Devils. He constantly recovered his body, and the devouring speed of the Fiendcelestial was inferior to his recovery speed.
 About twenty breaths of time passed!
Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com The situation suddenly changed!
 Han Jue felt two extremely strong killing intents coming from both sides. He immediately moved and dodged easily.
 Turning around, he saw two Dao Heavenly Devils colliding. They looked no different from the Dao Heavenly Devil himself.
 The Sages widened their eyes. There was more than one Dao Heavenly Devil?
 Qiu Xilai was even more stunned. He had never seen the Dao Heavenly Devil’s two Dharma Idols before.
 If both Dharma Idols appeared at the same time…
 Qiu Xilai didn’t dare to think further. He only felt his blood run cold and his heart fill with fear.
 The 74 Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols continued to destroy the Dao Heavenly Devil. Han Jue turned around and prepared to deal with the two Dharma Idols.
 The Grand Unity Aspect was only one of his methods. He didn’t completely rely on it.
 Han Jue raised his right hand, and the Primordial Judgment Sword appeared in his palm.
 With a shake of his right hand, the sword blade shook out an afterimage. Countless sword shadows shot out like a huge silver-white lotus blooming, dazzling and magnificent
 Mystical Power, Unparalleled Sword Qi!
 A Dao Heavenly Devil Dharma Idol suddenly stepped forward and opened its bloody mouth. It spat out a terrifying aura of resentment. It was scarlet and terrifying. It was like a huge river that connected the heavens and the earth.
 Boom
 The sword Qi collided with the River of Resentment, emitting a domineering wind that shook the endless ice.
 Han Jue raised his eyebrows. This fellow was something
 This resentment aura was extremely corrosive. It could even melt his sword Qi.
 Han Jue took out the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus and attacked the Dao Heavenly Devil Dharma idol.
 The rolling grudge spat out by the Dao Heavenly Devil was directly absorbed by the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus. The 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus quickly approached the Dao Heavenly Devil with the vast grudge.
 The other Dao Heavenly Devil Dharma Idol suddenly disappeared, reappearing behind Han Jue.
 In an instant, Han Jue felt the surrounding space freeze. A powerful pressure surged from all directions.
 Han Jue immediately used the Great Traversal Divine Shadow. He split into nine divine shadows and attacked the second Dao Heavenly Devil Dharma Idol.
 The second Dao Heavenly Devil’s eyes widened. The Chaotic Space fluctuated visibly, and the speed of the nine Great Traversal Divine Shadows slowed down.
 “One can use resentment and the other can freeze space. Their abilities are different from the main body.”
 Han Jue thought silently. He didn’t panic.
 The aura of the Dao Heavenly Devil’s main body became weaker and weaker. It couldn’t withstand the Grand Unity Aspect anymore. When he died, the two Dharma Idols would naturally be nothing to fear.
 At this moment, the Sages attacked one after another, restraining the second Dao Heavenly Devil Dharma idol.
 They could tell that Han Jue’s 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus suppressed the first Dao Heavenly Devil Dharma idol, so they restricted the second.
 Han Jue immediately controlled the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus to suppress the first Dao Heavenly Devil Dharma idol. No matter what Mystical Power the first Dao Heavenly Devil Dharma idol used, it was all absorbed by the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus.
 Boom
 The Dao Heavenly Devil’s main body was completely shattered, but in the next second, his legs recovered.
 But his legs were no longer enough to support him.
 “Who are you…”
 The Dao Heavenly Devil’s venomous voice sounded.
 Han Jue didn’t answer.
 Suddenly!
 The Strange Deity flew out from the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus. The Sages couldn’t see it, but the Dao Heavenly Devil could.
 “No,” the Dao Heavenly Devil shouted in horror as the Strange Deity rushed over. Han Jue accurately controlled the Fiendcelestial Dharma idol and didn’t hurt it.
 The Dao Heavenly Devil’s legs were devoured again and turned into dust. He suddenly condensed into a black ball of light and tried to escape.
 However, the Nightmare Fiendcelestial reached out and grabbed the black ball of light that the Dao Heavenly Devil had transformed into.
 The Strange Deity flew over and devoured the black ball of light.
 The other two Dao Heavenly Devil Dharma idols roared and turned into dust.
 The Heavenly Devils frozen in the endless ice also turned into dust.
 The 33rd Heaven fell silent.
 Han Jue didn’t relax. Instead, he quickly moved around the 33rd Heaven and kept using the simulation trial to detect the surrounding enemies.
 The Sages were stunned. They looked at him nervously, not understanding what he was doing.
 Could it be that the Dao Heavenly Devil was still alive?
 (You have killed all the Heavenly Devils and obtained a Great Dao Fragment, a Supreme Treasure, and a chance to activate a new function of the system.]
 [Congratulations on obtaining a Freedom Supreme Treasure, Heavenly Devil Heart Protecting Jade)
 (Heavenly Devil Heart Protecting Jade: Freedom Supreme Treasure. Its defense is extremely strong. It can summon the Heavenly Devil to protect itself and defend against a blow from a Freedom Sage.]
 (Congratulations on activating a new function of the system-Primordial Heavenly Prison]
 [Primordial Heavenly Prison: It can only be located in the Dao Field. If any existence is imprisoned, depending on their cultivation, the imprisoned time will be different until they become a Dao Field slave. Their life and death will be controlled by the Lord of the Dao Field. The Primordial Heavenly Prison can only imprison one living being at the same time.]
 Han Jue didn’t pay attention to the lines of words in front of him. He moved repeatedly and jumped through the 33rd Heaven. After confirming that there were no powerful enemies, he heaved a sigh of relief.
 He left after saying, “The Heavenly Devil Calamity has been resolved. Fellow Daoists, don’t worry!”
 Han Jue took away the Strange Deity and jumped back into the Dao Field.
 Han Jue was still very nervous even after returning to the Daoist temple.
 It was finally resolved!
 How thrilling!
 It had to be said that the other Sages had also contributed greatly to this battle.
 Han Jue’s impression of them improved, but only slightly. He didn’t let down his guard.
 At this moment, a loud voice resounded through the myriad worlds.
 “The Heavenly Devil Calamity has been eliminated. Fortunately, the Sect Master of the Hidden Sect took action. I, Qiu Xilai, will use the name of the Sect Master of the Dao Sect and the Heavenly Dao to confer the Immeasurable Merit Divine Might Heavenly Sage title to the Hidden Sect’s Sect Master. I hope that all living beings will remember his meritorious deed. From now on, the Dao Sect and the Hidden Sect will be on good terms. All past grudges will disappear like smoke!”
 Han Jue was stunned.
 This guy…
 It was unexpected, but on second thought, it made sense.
 The Sages would definitely not dare to find trouble with Han Jue anymore. It was better to appease him and resolve the grudge now. It was a favor and could end their bad karma. Such an action was expected of a Sage.
