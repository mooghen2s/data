 Inside the Connate Cave Abode.
 Han Jue’s lifespan decreased by 1.5 trillion years, and he started to feel dizzy.
 He had to stop.
 Sage Fated Secrets wasn’t in his interpersonal relationships and Han Jue couldn’t know about his recent situation. This was not good.
 Should he visit Sage Fated Secrets in his dreams?
 “If I visit Sage Fated Secrets, will he see through my true identity?” Han Jue asked in his mind.
 (4 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [Dark Nightmare is a Great Dao Mystical Power. As long as you are not exposed, the Heavenly Dao Sage cannot see through you in the dream realm.]
 Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief. In that case, he was relieved.
 He immediately dreamed of Sage Fated Secrets.
 Soon, he entered the dream realm. This dream realm was the future scene he had deduced. It was an endless desert with sand covering the sky.
 Sage Fated Secrets was meditating in front.
 He slowly opened his eyes and looked at him.
 Han Jue had already transformed into the Dark Forbidden Lord. He swayed like a black shadow, looking terrifying and strange.
 Seeing the Dark Forbidden Lord, Sage Fated Secrets was not puzzled. Instead, he praised, “This Mystical Power is impressive. It forcefully pulled me into a dream. Although it doesn’t trap me, I can’t deduce the karma and fate within it, nor can I see through you.”
 Han Jue said, “You’re pushing the calamity. You want to destroy all living beings.”
 Sage Fated Secrets asked calmly, “Why?”
 “The Buddhist Sect is still in the Immortal World. You’re the only one who knows the Dao Destruction Mystical Power. The outcome of the calamity will be someone using the Dao Destruction Mystical Power to clean up all living beings. Your true goal is to replace the Dao Ancestor. You will first destroy the humans and immortals supported by the Dao Ancestor before creating a new race.”
 Han Jue spoke very casually and didn’t deliberately mention Su Qi.
 Sage Fated Secrets said, “Not long ago, two people learned a Dao Destruction Mystical Power. How can you be sure that it was me? I’m still preaching in the Immortal World and the Heavenly Dao is observing.”
 Han Jue continued, “The Dao Ancestor is actually everywhere. Everything is in the eyes of the Dao Ancestor. I advise you to behave yourself.”
 Why hadn’t this fellow developed hatred towards him yet?
 Was he forcing him to show off?
 Sage Fated Secrets smiled and did not reply.
 “If you insist, I can only be your enemy,” Han Jue said, his heart trembling.
 He was provoking a Sage. Although he was certain that the Sages could not deduce him, he was still a little scared. Sage Fated Secrets asked, “You want to anger
 me?”
 Han Jue remained silent.
 As expected of a Sage. (Sage Fated Secrets has developed hatred towards you. Current Hatred Points: 1 star.)
 Sage Fated Secrets said, “Then, I want to see how you can become my enemy. With just your insignificant curse?”
 Han Jue said, “What humans do, the heavens will see. If one is unjust, he will die. Sages rule over all living beings, but they are still humans.”
 Sage Fated Secrets was expressionless, but he was muttering in his mind.
 What did the other party mean?
 He began to calculate which Sage the Dark Forbidden Lord was.
 From the way he spoke, it was difficult to determine.
 Han Jue was about to end the dream when Sage Fated Secrets suddenly said, “The calamity is about to end. You don’t have much time left.”
 Hearing this, Han Jue was secretly puzzled.
 Was this a declaration of war or a reminder? The dream shattered.
 Han Jue returned to his cave abode.
 No matter what, Sage Fated Secrets was using Su Qi as a pawn. Han Jue couldn’t let him go.
 So what if he was a Sage? Han Jue would become a Sage sooner or later!
 He pulled out his interpersonal relationships and checked the information of Sage Fated Secrets.
 (Sage Fated Secrets: Cultivation unknown. Heavenly Dao Sage, Connate lifeform, Immeasurable Emperor. Because he suspects that you are the mastermind of the Immeasurable Calamity, he has developed hatred towards you. Current Hatred Points: 1 star.)
 Eh?
 Suspect me? Aren’t you the one?
 Han Jue showed a frown.
 (Sage Fated Secrets’ hatred towards you has increased. Current Hatred Points: 2 stars]
 It increased again!
 It seemed that this fellow had imagined some schemes made by him after returning.
 Han Jue thought of how Sage Fated Secrets said that the calamity was about to end and couldn’t help but ask in his mind, “How long until the calamity ends?”
 [Ten billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?] So much?
T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by nov(ê(l)biin.co/m However, compared to curses, it was still nothing.
 Continue!
 Han Jue thought silently. Unknowingly, he didn’t even care about ten billion years of lifespan. He felt that he had become arrogant.
 Who asked him to be so strong now!
 [According to the negative karma of the Heavenly Dao, it will shrink in at most a thousand years. The calamity will definitely end unless the Heavenly Dao collapses.]
 A thousand years?
 So fast!
 Han Jue frowned. He might not be able to reach the perfected Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm in a thousand years. It was almost impossible for him to kill Sage Fated Secrets with curses.
 Why was it so fast?
 Could it be because of the Sages’ participation?
 Han Jue felt that this was the reason. He checked the emails.
 [Your good friend Zhou Fan sacrificed his providence and gained enlightenment from the Heavenly Dao. His cultivation has increased greatly.]
 [Your good friend Zhou Fan was suppressed by the Heavenly Dao Sage and died.)
 (Your good friend Qiu Xilai was attacked by a Heavenly Dao Sage.]
 (Your disciple Su Qi spread bad luck. The providence of the Heavenly Court has decreased. The providence of the Human Race has decreased.]
 (Your good friend Ji Xianshen was attacked by your disciple Long Hao and was severely injured.)
 (Your grand-disciple Fang Liang used the power of the Heavenly Court’s providence to resist the Heavenly Dao Sage. He was suppressed and only a remnant soul remained.]
 (Your good friend Zhou Fan was saved by a mysterious existence and revived.]
 (Your good friend Heavenly Emperor has become more murderous due to negative karma.]
 Zhou Fan was beaten to death by a Sage!
 Then, he revived!
 As expected of the Dharma idol of Seven Dao Sage!
 Seven Dao Sage was an existence on the same level as Ancestor Xitian. If he attacked, the Heavenly Dao Sage might not even notice.
 Ancestor Xitian was indifferent to the Heavenly Dao. Why had the Seven Dao Sage been helping Zhou Fan? What was his goal in arranging for Zhou Fan to enter the cycle of reincarnation?
 Han Jue felt that there was more to this calamity.
 “I can’t go out again. I’ll curse here. If I can’t interfere, so be it.”
 Han Jue thought silently. He wasn’t as tough as Zhou Fan who had the protection of the Great Dao Divine Spirit.
 Sages ran rampant in the Immortal World. He would die if he went out!
 Han Jue made up his mind and prepared to survive this calamity.
 “Should I calculate my own background and deduce the origins of the system?”
 A question mark appeared above Han Jue’s mind.
 He immediately tried it. Then, his attributes panel appeared.
 He was speechless.
 Cultivation was endless. Dreams lasted for a thousand years.
 Another fifty years passed.
 Han Jue cursed Sage Fated Secrets every ten years, but the effect was minimal.
 He was also paying close attention to the emails and occasionally checked the Sages’ statuses.
 Zhou Fan, Ji Xianshen, Fang Liang, Duan Hongchen, the Heavenly Emperor, Pan Xin, and the others who were facing the calamity also appeared more and more frequently. The Heavenly Dao Immeasurable Calamity was about to shrink. A world-shattering battle was brewing.
 On this day, Zhao Xuanyuan visited Han Jue.
 After entering the cave abode, he directly expressed his intention.
 “Master, I’ve been feeling uneasy recently. I keep feeling that something big has happened and I can’t cultivate in peace.” Zhao Xuanyuan frowned.
 Han Jue said calmly, “The calamity is about to end. It’s the providence of the Human Race that’s affecting you.”
 Zhao Xuanyuan was moved. “So fast? Doesn’t that mean that a huge battle is about to break out? Can you predict the fate of the humans?”
