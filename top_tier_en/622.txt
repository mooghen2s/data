 Cundi said, “I’m not sure either, but the Dark Forbidden Lord is the greatest mastermind behind the restart of the Heavenly Dao. Because of him, our arrangements in the Heavenly Dao have been completely destroyed. Now that he’s targeting the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End and the Chaos, this is not good.
T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by nov(ê(l)biin.co/m “I suspect that the Dark Forbidden Lord is the Primordial Fiendcelestial.”
 The Chaotic Deity fell silent.
 He began to deduce the Dark Forbidden Lord.
 He couldn’t guess who the Dark Forbidden Lord was.
 He could only guess the impression the living beings in the Immortal World had of him.
 After a long while…
 The Chaotic Deity said, “In your opinion, where is the Primordial Fiendcelestial hiding?”
 The Chaos was too big. The Immortal World, the heavens, the Dark Forbidden Zone, the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End, the Ancient Desolate, the depths of the Chaos, and so on. Even the Chaotic Deity who controlled the Chaotic Order couldn’t see all the corners.
 Cundi said, “Immortal World! It must be the Immortal World, and it’s related to Han Jue. I even suspect that he’s the Dark Forbidden Lord and that he’s the Primordial Fiendcelestial. His potential is too ridiculous. If he’s not the reincarnation of a mighty figure, he can only be the Primordial Fiendcelestial.”
 “Han Jue?”
 The Chaotic Deity began to deduce Han Jue.
 He was stunned.
 A 130,000-year-old Freedom Sage… Impossible!
 Ever since the Chaotic Deity’s birth, he had never seen such talent.
 Back when Pangu appeared, he had also cultivated for a long time before attaining the Dao. Something was wrong with this kid!
 [The Chaotic Deity’s hatred towards you has increased. Current Hatred Points: 6.5 stars]
 6.5 stars?
 Han Jue was shocked.
 The highest emotional value he had ever seen was six stars. However, ever since the Primordial Heavenly Prison had appeared, a max favorability had appeared, and it was not six stars. In Han Jue’s opinion, six stars of hatred was already irreconcilable…
 6.5 stars…
 Even if the Great Dao was destroyed, hatred would still remain?
 Ridiculous!
 Killing intent burst out from Han Jue’s eyes. He had to eliminate the Chaotic Deity! However, it was very difficult for him to kill the other party now. Even if the Chaotic Deity wanted to kill him, it was impossible unless Han Jue left the Heavenly Dao.
 Han Jue made up his mind never to leave the Heavenly Dao again.
 He adjusted his state of mind and continued cultivating.
 Several hundred years later, he finally completed a thousand years of seclusion.
 Han Jue was already 131,808 years old. In terms of age, he was already an old monster.
 After his seclusion ended, Han Jue opened the emails and checked his recent friends.
 [Your good friend Evil Heavenly Emperor obtained the Dark Sage King’s Dao Fruit. He used his strength to attain the Dao and became a Primordial Chaos Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal.]
 (Your grand-disciple Fang Liang has absorbed the Heavenly Dao Spirit. His cultivation has increased greatly and his providence has increased greatly.]
 (Your good friend Ancestor Xitian was cursed by a ‘mysterious curse.]
 (Your descendant Han Yu was attacked by a mysterious Deity Realm cultivator and was severely injured.)
 [Your disciple Ji Xianshen received guidance from your good friend Emperor Xiao and learned a Mystical Power.)
 [Your good friend Empress Houtu was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure and was severely injured.]
 [Your good friend Shi Dudao has obtained the Primordial Purple Qi. His providence has increased greatly.)
 The Heavenly Emperor had used his strength to attain the Dao…
 Han Jue sighed when he saw this message.
 This was definitely a path of no return.
 The Dark Sage King was only a pawn. The Heavenly Emperor had inherited his identity as a pawn. He would definitely suffer in the future.
 However, after meeting him that day, Han Jue knew that the Evil Heavenly Emperor was already too far gone. His hatred for the Heavenly Dao Sages was deeply rooted, and he even wanted to destroy the Heavenly Dao.
 Although the Evil Heavenly Emperor had taken the wrong path, Han Jue didn’t want to eliminate him.
 Because the Evil Heavenly Emperor had treated him well before and did not have any hatred towards him even now.
 The emails that followed were also very exciting and had a lot of information.
 The Heavenly Dao Spirit that had disappeared for a long time was actually obtained by Fang Liang. It was probably the Dao Ancestor’s plot.
 Ancestor Xitian was cursed. Interesting. This meant that someone was really using the name of the Dark Forbidden Lord to cause trouble. It should be from the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End. The Heavenly Dao Sages still hoped that Ancestor Xitian would protect them, so why would they curse him?
 Below, Han Jue was attracted by Shi Dudao.
 Primordial Purple Qi!
 It was most likely Fuxitian’s Primordial Purple Qi!
 Nüwa had begun to take action!
 Han Jue thought for a moment and sent a dream to Shi Dudao.
 The Dark Nightmare forcefully pulled Shi Dudao into the dream without any reaction time.
 In the dream.
 Shi Dudao suddenly opened his eyes. Seeing Han Jue covered in divine light, he couldn’t help but heave a sigh of relief.
 He remembered him. The Great Freedom Heaven Imprisoning Palm that Han Jue had taught him was vast and profound. He was still cultivating it.
 Han Jue said, “Did a Sage contact you?”
 Shi Dudao had a five-star favorability towards him. He wanted to test if this five-star favorability represented loyalty.
 Hearing this, Shi Dudao hesitated for a moment and said, “That’s right. They also gave me a Primordial Purple Qi. As for who it is, I can’t say. Senior, please forgive me.”
 “You want to become a Heavenly Dao Sage?”
 “Who doesn’t want to become a Sage?” Shi Dudao replied matter-of-factly. He had been stuck at the perfected Pseudo-Sage Realm for too long. His Dao attainment was about to become his mental demon.
 Han Jue said, “When will you attain the Dao?”
 It was fine for Shi Dudao to attain the Dao. He would first test the waters and see what kind of changes the new Sage would bring to the Heavenly Dao.
 “I’ll attain the Dao in the next ten thousand years,” Shi Dudao said in a low voice.
 He paused for a moment and asked, “Senior, what do you think of me?”
 “Why do you ask?”
 “I understand that after attaining the Dao, I will definitely have to pick a side. The Sage who gave me the Primordial Purple Qi is also not kind.”
 “Join me. As long as you don’t harm the world and kill people from different sects, I won’t have too many requirements and restrictions on you. What I pursue is the Great Dao, not power. Power is only for convenience,” Han Jue replied very casually, but Shi Dudao’s eyes lit up.
 Shi Dudao was also such a person. He pursued strength and not power. This was also the reason why he was independent. However, becoming a Sage would definitely lead him astray because he needed to fight for providence to become stronger.
 “I look forward to your performance after you become a Sage.”
 With that, Han Jue removed the dream.
 He only needed to maintain a good relationship with Shi Dudao. If this fellow wanted to stab him in the back, he could just throw him into the Primordial Heavenly Prison.
 To put it bluntly, the current Heavenly Dao was Han Jue’s territory!
 Whoever dared to provoke him would either die or become a slave.
 He was only afraid of forcing the mighty figure in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End into a corner, so he kept a low profile. Han Jue opened his eyes and muttered, “Shi Dudao is the next Sage. Then, it’s time for Li Daokong to attain the Dao.”
 He had a Primordial Purple Qi and a Great Dao Purple Qi in his possession. It was enough to let Li Daokong become a Sage.
 Li Daokong was a very important step for him and was also the Hidden Sect disciple he valued the most.
 Before joining the Hidden Sect, Li Daokong had already proved his strength. While the other geniuses were still famous for their potential, Li Daokong had already made others ignore his potential.
 After Li Daokong obtained the Buzhou Divine Mountain, his cultivation level had been steadily increasing.
 He had already reached the late-stage Pseudo-Sage Realm, but he was still a step away from the perfected Pseudo-Sage Realm and couldn’t break through.
 Han Jue sent a voice transmission to Li Daokong and asked him to return.
 The next day, Li Daokong arrived at the Hundred Peak Immortal River, and Han Jue moved him into the Daoist temple. Li Daokong bowed respectfully. Although he didn’t know why Han Jue was looking for him, it must be something important.
 Han Jue said, “It’s time to attain the Dao.”,
 Dao attainment!
 Li Daokong was stunned. He didn’t expect this.
 Then, his breathing quickened. “I can already attain the Dao?”
 “You’re still lacking a little. Cultivate beside me first and reach the perfected realm. I’ll let you attain the Dao.”
 Han Jue said calmly as if Sages were not worth mentioning in his eyes.
 Wait patiently more chapters will be updated soon
