 He opened his eyes and came to an extremely dark and mysterious space. In front of him was a ball of red light that changed between light and dark. It was ghastly red.
 He saw Zhou Fan.
 Zhou Fan was inside the red ball of light. He was wrapped by black tentacles covered in spikes, leaving only his soul body.
 This was…
 Han Jue frowned and looked up. This red ball of light was extremely vast. It was like a Star Field filled with a red aura. No living beings or souls could be seen.
 He looked at Zhou Fan. The black tentacles did not look like solid objects, they were more like illusions. But they were indeed absorbing Zhou Fan’s soul power.
 Just as Han Jue was wondering where this was, a line of words appeared in front of him.
 [Paradise Purgatory: Chaotic Forbidden Ground. It is formed by the will of an ancient Chaotic Fiendcelestial. The consciousness of the person who enters will be immersed in the illusion of paradise and will not be able to extricate himself until his soul and body are devoured.)
 Formed by an ancient Chaotic Fiendcelestial?
 Han Jue frowned even more.
 The illusion shattered. He opened his eyes and asked, “Who plotted against Zhou Fan?” (Ten billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?] Continue!
 A figure appeared in Han Jue’s mind.
 Dark Sage King!
 Indeed, it’s him!
 The only Chaotic expert who had been coveting the Heavenly Dao recently was the Dark Sage King!
 re  This fellow was courting death. Zhou Fan was the Seven Dao Sage’s manifestation. Wasn’t this a provocation towards Seven Dao Sage?
 From the lifespan consumed by derivation, it was impossible for the Dark Sage King to be a match for the Seven Dao Sage.
 Han Jue put down his distracting thoughts and continued cultivating. It was really dangerous to leave the Heavenly Dao. Anyway, Zhou Fan had the Seven Dao Sage’s backing, so there was no need to trouble him to personally take action.
 Several decades later.
 [Detected that you are 60,000 years old and your life has taken another step forward. You have the following choices:]
 (1: Exit seclusion immediately and preach to the heavens to snatch the Heavenly Dao’s providence. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment.]
 [2: Cultivate in a low-profile manner and form your own Dao. Stay away from karma and trouble. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment, a Supreme Treasure, and a Heavenly Dao Spirit Stone.]
Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m Han Jue opened his eyes and sighed. Time passed really quickly.
 50,000 years seemed like yesterday.
 The system became obedient and didn’t let Han Jue fall into a dilemma.
 However, the reward was too terrifying.
 Han Jue silently chose the second option.
 [You chose to cultivate in a low-profile manner and obtained a Great Dao Fragment, a Supreme Treasure, and a Heavenly Dao Spirit Stone.)
 [Congratulations on obtaining the Freedom Supreme Treasure— Killing Dao Token]
 [Killing Dao Token: Freedom Slaughter Supreme Treasure. Sacrificing lifespan and providence can allow you to kill enemies. Your words can become reality. You cannot kill living beings who have no karma with you. You are not allowed to use it unless you are in a battle.]
 Han Jue raised his eyebrows.
 How impressive!
 Han Jue immediately took out the Killing Dao Token. This token was different from what he had imagined. It was more like an unsheathed sword. It was three feet long and completely blood-red. Traces of light flowed around it. Holding this token, terrifying killing intent surged towards him, causing his black hair to flutter.
 Amazing!
 Han Jue began to make it recognize him as its owner.
 Half a year later, he successfully subdued the Killing Dao Token.
 This was the first time he had worked so hard. If not for the system, he might not have been able to subdue this treasure at all and might have even been devoured by it.
 Han Jue immediately entered the simulation trial and started to use this treasure.
 There was no actual consumption of his lifespan in the simulation trial, so he could do whatever he wanted.
 Facing Heavenly Venerate Wufa, he sacrificed a trillion years of his lifespan and spat out the word ‘execution’. Heavenly Venerate Wufa turned into dust on the spot.
 So powerful!
 Han Jue’s heart beat faster.
 Against ordinary Sages, he didn’t even need to sacrifice his lifespan to insta-kill them.
 Was this the Freedom Slaughter Supreme Treasure?
 Han Jue’s heart beat faster. It was equivalent to an alternate Book of Misfortune!
 However, the Book of Misfortune took the continuous path, while the Killing Dao Token took the domineering path.
 The Book of Misfortune had wider uses and could kill people subtly. However, the Killing Dao Token had to be used in battle. Han Jue couldn’t hide in the Daoist temple and use it to plot against the enemy.
 Han Jue began to challenge Ancestor Xitian. He was insta-killed even with the Killing Dao Token. This was the case when he didn’t dodge in the beginning.
 “I’ll directly sacrifice 300 sextillion years of my lifespan!”
 Han Jue thought silently. He entered the simulation trial again and directly sacrificed his lifespan.
 “Die!”
 Han Jue waved his token and spat out a word. The Killing Dao Token shook violently in his hand and red light burst out.
 The high and mighty Ancestor Xitian suddenly turned to dust.
 Han Jue was pleasantly surprised.
 Success?
 I can finally compete with a Great Dao Sage?
 At this moment, Han Jue saw Ancestor Xitian’s figure condense again and say, “Kill.”
 Han Jue died on the spot. He couldn’t resist at all!
 Han Jue opened his eyes, looking terrified.
 “I can’t provoke Ancestor Xitian. Otherwise, even if I use the Freedom Supreme Treasure and sacrifice all my lifespan, I still won’t be able to kill him.”
 Han Jue restrained himself.
 He almost became arrogant.
 He was grateful to Ancestor Xitian.
 Although the ancestor didn’t know, he had always encouraged Han Jue.
 He was a true sage!
 Han Jue took out the Heavenly Dao Spirit Stone and suddenly had a bold thought.
 Should he use it to upgrade the Killing Dao Token this time?
 He immediately tried.
 (Do not upgrade the Killing Dao Token. Once this treasure upgrades to the Great Dao level, it will devour you and give birth to a Great Dao Spirit.]
 Han Jue froze upon seeing this line of words that suddenly appeared.
 He almost got screwed!
 Dharma treasures could become spirits?
 Han Jue had no choice but to obediently upgrade the Book of Misfortune.
 In the end, the Book of Misfortune was upgraded from a Heavenly Dao Supreme Treasure to a Freedom Numinous Treasure.
 Holding the book, Han Jue could clearly feel that the aura of misfortune was very strong. Unknowingly, he had nurtured an extremely terrifying evil creature.
 “Should I curse a Sage to death to liven things?up?”
 Han Jue had another thought.
 Forget it.
 He didn’t want to attract another Immeasurable Calamity. It was good now. The Sages didn’t provoke him and could still maintain the order of the Heavenly Dao and protect the Immortal World.
 If not for the Sages managing the Heavenly Dao, how could Han Jue cultivate in peace?
 It wasn’t easy to determine if he was friend or foe.
 Han Jue put away the Book of Misfortune and perked up before continuing to cultivate.
 He was getting closer and closer to the late-stage Primordial Chaos Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm!
 He was confident that he could break through in ten thousand years!
 After that, he would reach the perfected Primordial Chaos Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm within 100,000 years!
 This cultivation speed was alright!
 33rd Heaven, Buddhist Dao Field.
 In the hall, Qiu Xilai sat on the lotus throne. Golden light surrounded his body, forming a pillar of light that was holy and solemn.
 A figure appeared in front of him.
 “I can feel that Han Jue has become stronger again,” the Heavenly Dao Spirit said in a low voice, its tone filled with uneasiness.
 Qiu Xilai did not open his eyes. “It’s not surprising. His potential is already ridiculous. Besides, I can’t deal with him now. Let’s wait for me to fuse the Dao.”
 The Heavenly Dao Spirit said, “Even if you fuse the Dao, you might not be his match. Unless…”
 “Unless what?”
 “Unless you obtain the Dao Ancestor’s power.”
 “The Dao Ancestor has been missing for a long time. Do you know where he is?”.
 “I don’t, but I know where his three corpse clones are. If you can obtain one, you can easily kill Han Jue.”
