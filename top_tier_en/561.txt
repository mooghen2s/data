 However, as time passed, he discovered that the situation was not good.
 An attitude of lacking interest in cultivation began to appear among the Nether Race.
 There were no mortal enemies or goals. They had been cultivating in a boring manner, causing many Nether Zeniths and other disciples to slack off and even give up.
 This was also the case among the personal disciples. The Black Hell Chicken, the Chaotic Heavenly Dog, Zhou Mingyue, and so on.
 Very few disciples didn’t slack off at all. In the entire Hidden Sect, other than Han Jue, only Li Yao kept cultivating in seclusion. The others would occasionally stop cultivating and relax.
 Han Jue stood up and left. He was thinking along the way.
 Was he really right?
 Not everyone was in a hurry to cultivate.
 In terms of vision, the other disciples were inferior to him. From their point of view, the Hidden Sect was already invincible. With Han Jue above them, cultivation was not that important.
 Besides, if they didn’t like to cultivate, who could cultivate diligently all the time?
 Just like in his previous life, everyone knew that studying was good and could change fate, but how many people actually insisted on studying? After returning to the Daoist temple, Han Jue was still thinking about this question.
 Ten years later, all the disciples woke up from their Dao comprehension state.
 Han Jue’s voice suddenly resounded throughout the Hidden Sect.
 “The Immortal World pursues the Sage position, so our Hidden Sect naturally has to pursue it. The Heavenly Dao has nine Heavenly Dao Sages, but our Hidden Sect has more than nine. If you have ambitions, cultivate well. As long as you reach the perfected Pseudo-Sage Realm, I have a way to help you become Sages. How many Sages the Hidden Sect can produce depends on your efforts!”
 The entire Hidden Sect was in an uproar.
 Sage!
 The million disciples were all excited.
 If other Sages said this, they might scoff, but from Han Jue’s point of view, they all believed
 For a time, the Hidden Sect was in an uproar. Everyone was discussing this matter. Many disciples began to enter seclusion.
 Han Jue secretly heaved a sigh of relief.
 This stimulant was only temporary. After a period of time, their passion would definitely decrease.

 Spring passed and autumn came.
 A thousand years passed in the blink of an eye.
 Perhaps because nothing happened, Han Jue felt that the past thousand years had been unprecedentedly fast, as if he had a blurry dream.
 There were no storms or conflicts in the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 Although the battle in the Immortal World did not stop, it did not affect the Hundred Peak Immortal River. Most of the Hidden Sect disciples could feel the peace.
 Why most?
 Because many disciples still wanted to leave.
 They felt that they were already strong enough or couldn’t take another step forward, so they didn’t want to cultivate anymore.
 On this day.
 Han Jue summoned Han Zuitian and asked him to screen in-name disciples who couldn’t increase their cultivation and send them to the Heavenly Race.
 Han Jue originally wanted to support the Heavenly Court, but he felt that there was no need.
 The Heavenly Emperor had already established the new Heavenly Court. What was the use of the old Heavenly Court?
 If they supported the Heavenly Court and the Heavenly Race, wouldn’t there be chaos if these two forces fought each other?
 Several days later, five thousand in-name disciples left. A third consisted of Immortal Emperors, and the remaining were Grand Unity Golden Immortals.
 Han Jue pulled Fang Liang and Ji Xianshen into a dream at the same time.
 The dream was a small forest near the Jade Pure Sacred Sect. Seeing him, they immediately knelt down and bowed.
 Han Jue said, “From now on, the vice leader of the Heavenly Race will be Fang Liang. The two of you will support each other and control the Heavenly Race alone to fight for the Heavenly Dao’s providence.”
 Hearing this, Fang Liang was stunned. He had long guessed that the Hidden Sect was supporting Ji Xianshen, but Ji Xianshen didn’t say anything, so he didn’t dare to believe it.
 Hearing Han Jue’s words now, he still had mixed feelings.
 Why don’t you support my Heavenly Court?
 This thought couldn’t be dismissed.
 Ji Xianshen smiled readily and said, “Of course. The burden on me can finally be lifted.”
 Han Jue said calmly, “Fang Liang, don’t be tied down by the Heavenly Court. The previous Heavenly Emperor is still alive and has also established a new Heavenly Court. Be careful not to be implicated. A new era needs a new face. The leader of the Heavenly Race is not the end for you. I have higher expectations for you. This is only the beginning of your training. Don’t disappoint
 me.”
 Ji Xianshen and Fang Liang were stunned.
 Higher expectations?
 Could it be the Sage position? Their hearts beat faster. They already knew that Han Jue was a Sage and not an ordinary Heavenly Dao Sage. Han Jue had his own Dao attainment method!
 Ji Xianshen’s eyes burned as he asked, “Are you a Sage?”
 Han Jue said, “The Heavenly Dao is not everything in my eyes. I hope that you can follow in my footsteps. Do you know where the previous generation of Sages went?”
 The two of them shook their heads with curiosity.
 Han Jue waved his sleeve and removed the dream.
 The rest was left to the two of them to mediate.
 Han Jue continued cultivating. He was only at the mid-stage Primordial Chaos Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm and was still far from the Freedom Sage Realm, let alone the Great Dao Sage Realm.
 There was still a long way to go!
 He had to set a goal first. Before the next Immeasurable Calamity arrived, he had to reach the Great Dao Sage Realm!
 Three hundred years later.
 “I, Qiu Xilai, will preach the Dao in the 33rd Heaven a thousand years later. This lecture will choose the Sage candidate to replace me in the future!”
 Qiu Xilai’s voice resounded through the myriad worlds, causing an uproar.
 Sage position!
 This time was different from the past. Qiu Xilai had clearly said that he would give up his position!
 Han Jue, who was cultivating, opened his eyes with a strange expression.
 Qiu Xilai wanted to abdicate?
 He was only a late-stage Heavenly Dao Sage and had yet to reach the perfected realm. How could he abdicate?
 Han Jue felt that this fellow was going to trick someone again.
 He suddenly had a bold idea.
 “I want to know who the Heavenly Dao Sages are when the next calamity begins.”
 [Ten billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 Nine figures appeared in Han Jue’s mind.
 Qiu Xilai, Li Muyi, the South Extreme Heavenly Venerate, Li Daokong, Yi Tian, Huang Zuntian, Fuxitian, Great Loose Heaven, Jin Shen, and two unknown Sages.
 Their information appeared in front of Han Jue.
 [Great Loose Heaven: Heavenly Dao Sage, Immeasurable Emperor]
 (Jin Shen: Heavenly Dao Sage, Ancient Master of Calamity)
 Han Jue had a strange expression.
 Sect Master Tian Jue and Emperor Xiao were gone. It was unknown if they had transcended or perished, but Li Muyi had actually returned to the Heavenly Dao Sage position.
 It wasn’t surprising that Li Daokong had become a Sage. Although it was fast, it was normal for Yi Tian as a Son of the Heavenly Dao.
 Huang Zuntian…
 Han Jue could only say one word.
 Amazing!
 Han Jue had always been letting Huang Zuntian be. He could be where he was today because of his own efforts.
 “Yi Tian became a Sage. Why did that kid Han Tuo fall behind?”
 Han Jue thought silently and continued to derive, “I want to know Han Tuo’s cultivation level when the next calamity begins?”
 [It involves your own karma and unknown karma. You are not allowed to derive it.]
 Han Jue showed a frown.
 What was the unknown karma?
 It seemed that he had to pay more attention to Han Tuo in the future.
 Han Jue immediately looked around and accidentally discovered that Han Tuo and Yi Tian had already left the sea and arrived at the center of the Immortal World. They were cultivating in a mysterious place filled with ancient restrictions.
 The limbs of the previous Immeasurable Calamity mighty figures were thrown down by Emperor Xiao. It was unknown who had piled them here.
