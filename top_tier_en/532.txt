 Ji Xianshen said calmly, “It’s fine. I’ve also become a Pseudo-Sage. I’ll deal with him. The Dragon Race will be handed over to the Heavenly Court. I have too little power in my hands. This mission cannot be made public.”
 Pseudo-Sage? Fang Liang sized him up and suddenly felt that he was a little unfamiliar. He asked carefully, “Could it be those limbs?” Ji Xianshen had told him about the technique taught by a Sage. He had felt that it wasn’t reliable before, but he didn’t expect Ji Xianshen to really succeed.
 Ji Xianshen said, “Alright, don’t talk about this. Next, tell us how to attack the Dragon Race. The Dragon Race is hidden under the Eastern Sea of the Immortal World. There are countless restrictions and array formations, especially the Four Seas Dragon Formation. It can summon the Ancient Dragon Soul. We need…”
 The two of them began to discuss the details of the war against the Dragon Race.
 Spring passed and autumn came. Another three hundred years passed.
 Han Jue was getting closer and closer to 40,000 years old.
 Recently, the Immortal World had become more and more lively, causing him to feel that time was beginning to slow down.
 Han Jue would check his emails every ten years. He would surf the net and find joy in his boring cultivation.
 On this day.
 The temperature of the world rose rapidly. The flowers and plants on the mountain withered at a speed visible to the naked eye before turning into dust.
 Han Jue felt something and looked up. A vast sun appeared in the starry sky of the tenth level.
Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m The sun and moon existed in the tenth Heaven, not the 33rd Heaven. The 33rd Heaven was the chaos, the peak of the Heavenly Dao.
 The sun wasn’t rare, but the energy of this sun was boiling and still increasing rapidly as if it wanted to burn the Immortal World.
 Han Jue saw a huge three-legged Golden Crow curled up in the sun. Its body was definitely one of the top terrifying beasts in the Immortal World.
 Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal!
 Han Jue raised his eyebrows. The Golden Crow Divine Clan was going to appear again?
 Interesting!
 It seemed that even if the Heavenly Dao restarted, some characters would still appear.
 Was it fate?
 The sudden heat didn’t last long. Han Jue saw the Heavenly Race attack and imprison the sun. To the living beings in the Immortal World, they thought it was a natural disaster.
 Several days later, Jiang Yi found him.
 “Sect Master, the Golden Crow Divine Clan is summoning me.”
 “Have you reached the Pseudo-Sage Realm?”
 “No, but the Golden Crow Divine Clan is in danger…”
 “Have you reached the Pseudo-Sage Realm?”
 “Sect Master, can’t you…”
 “Have you reached the Pseudo-Sage Realm?”
 Jiang Yi almost collapsed. No matter how strong his potential was, it would take him many years to reach the Pseudo-Sage Realm!
 Apart from Han Jue and Li Daokong, who else in the entire Hidden Sect could reach the Pseudo-Sage Realm?
 Han Jue said expressionlessly, “Go back and cultivate. Even if you want to escape, don’t think about leaving. Believe me, nothing will happen to the Golden Crow Divine Clan. Even if something happens, you can create a new Golden Crow Divine Clan. What are you afraid
 of?”
 Jiang Yi was speechless.
 In the end, he still couldn’t convince Han Jue and could only leave in a daze.
 Since Han Jue had set the rules, he wouldn’t break them easily to prevent another tragedy.
 He discovered that these disciples had to be suppressed with power. Otherwise, there would always be people who couldn’t control themselves.
 Time passed.
 Several decades later.
 [Detected that you have reached 40,000 years old. You have the following choices:]
 (1: Exit seclusion immediately and fight for the providence of the Heavenly Dao to dominate the Immortal World. You can obtain a chance to upgrade the Dao Field and a Heavenly Dao Spirit Stone.]
 [2: Cultivate in a low-profile manner and do not participate in the affairs of the world. Maintain your original intention. You can obtain a chance to upgrade the Dao Field, a Mystical Power inheritance, and a Great Dao Fragment.)
 Upgrade the Dao Field!
 Han Jue was in a good mood. The system didn’t disappoint him, after all.
 He chose the second option.
 The Heavenly Dao Spirit Stone wasn’t very useful for the time being. He couldn’t curse a Sage to death directly, so there was no need to stare at it.
 [You chose to cultivate in a low-profile manner and obtained a chance to upgrade the Dao Field, a Mystical Power inheritance, and a Great Dao Fragment.]
 [The Dao Field has begun to upgrade.]
 [Congratulations on obtaining the Mystical Power—Invocation Dao]
 [Invocation Dao: The final form of the Invocation Technique. The Dao Lord of the Invocation Technique can reversely summon all the followers who have grasped the Invocation Technique. They cannot refuse.]
 Han Jue looked at the lines of words in front of him and became happier.
 The Invocation Dao was okay, but it was a group summoning technique, and it was a forceful one.
 It was very useful. It could be used against enemies or to relocate his own force.
 He had already accumulated seven Great Dao Fragments. He was only missing two. Then, he could continue to comprehend the Great Dao.
 As his cultivation level increased, the chances of triggering the system’s choice decreased. However, once it was triggered, it would definitely bring top-notch prizes.
 Han Jue began to inherit the Invocation Dao.
 It took time to level up the Dao Field.
 It took fifty years to successfully level up.
 [The Dao Field has been upgraded. The array formation has been upgraded to the Great Dao Sage level. It has expanded the internal space of the Dao Field.)
 [Dao Field Immortal Qi has increased by ten times. Connate Qi has increased by ten times.]
 [The Dao Field can block the prying of the Great Dao Supreme existences.]
 Great Dao Sage level!
 Han Jue immediately felt safe.
 But to block the Great Dao Supreme, what level was that?
 “I want to know Ancestor Xitian’s realm.” Han Jue asked silently.
 He had a feeling that Ancestor Xitian wasn’t only a Great Dao Sage.
 Since Nüwa had already reached the Great Dao Sage Realm. Ancestor Xitian should be stronger.
 (160 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 (Great Dao Sage]
 Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief. It seemed that he had overestimated Ancestor Xitian.
 In other words, even Ancestor Xitian couldn’t break into the Dao Field now?
 Han Jue was amused.
 At this moment, no one in the Immortal World could kill him unless he ran out and courted death!
 Awesome!
 This was cultivation.
 In a good mood, Han Jue started the simulation trial and challenged Ancestor Xitian.
 The ancestor was still the ancestor. He easily killed him.
 Han Jue retracted his complacency and no longer dared to underestimate Ancestor Xitian.
 At the same time, all the disciples of the Hidden Sect could feel the Spirit Qi in the Dao Field beginning to increase. Laughter filled every corner of the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 “Sect Master is using his Mystical Power
 again!”
 “The Spirit Qi can still increase?”
 “This means that Sect Master has become stronger again. It’s really good to stay in the Hidden Sect. I just need to cultivate in peace.”
 “Sect Master is the true Sage. I heard from the living beings outside the Hundred Peak Immortal River that they cultivate under other Sages and occasionally have to carry out missions. There’s no cultivation holy land as peaceful as the Hidden Sect.”
 “Cultivate well and repay the Sect Master in the future.”
 “Sect Master said that only a Pseudo-Sage can go out. I’m afraid I won’t have the chance to repay him.”
 Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 Han Zuitian, Long-arm Ape, and the Three Immortals of Qu Jun gathered together.
 Eagle Head Immortal sighed. “Sect Master’s Mystical Power is truly unimaginable. How good would it be if we could become personal disciples?”
 Han Zuitian raised his wine cup and smiled. “You want to become a personal disciple? Other than talent, you still have to contribute.”
 Snake Head Immortal asked in surprise, “How? We can’t go out.”
 Han Zuitian smiled mysteriously. “You only need to be prepared. I need you later. I’ll go find Grandmaster in a few years.”
