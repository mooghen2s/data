 This child was definitely related to his master.
 However, he couldn’t directly point it out. What if Master had his own plan?
 Or was this a trap used by a Sage to trick his master?
 No matter what, he had to protect this kid first, but he couldn’t explain the reason.
 “From today onwards, this King will give you the Yin Yang Token. You will be equivalent to obtaining the position of a ghost servant, but you don’t have to carry out any duties. Go back as soon as possible.”
 Yang Tiandong waved his hand after saying that. A black light flew towards Han Tuo and landed in his hand.
 Han Tuo was stunned. He didn’t expect such a twist and was stupefied.
 Could it be that his parents were not simple?
 He was about to ask.
 Yang Tiandong said calmly, “Don’t you have a grudge to take revenge on? Hurry up and go. If you’re late and your body is destroyed, you can only reincarnate.”
 Han Tuo hurriedly stood up when he heard this, and he left after saying, “Thank you, King of Hell. I’ll remember this and repay you in the future!”
 Looking at his departing figure, Yang Tiandong sighed. “He really looks like Master.”
 He decided to personally go to the Immortal World and ask his master.
 “You don’t have to ask. It’s fine as long as you know. Take care of him whenever you can. There’s no need to deliberately interfere or tell him the truth.”
 Han Jue’s voice suddenly sounded in Yang Tiandong’s ears, startling him so much that he immediately stood up and prepared to bow.
 “Don’t make a fuss. You’re the King of Hell now. Someone will definitely be watching you,” Han Jue said sternly. Yang Tiandong was ashamed and hurriedly recovered.
 He asked in his mind, “Master, is he your son?”
 “Mm.”
 “Why not stay in the Hidden Sect?”
 “Training.” “His potential seems…” “Ignore it, that’s all!”
 “I’m sorry…”
 Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 It had been two hundred years since he learned that the Heavenly Dao had a spirit.
 Han Jue had always seen Han Tuo’s encounters and didn’t care much.
 Experiencing life and death was also a part of cultivation.
 Han Jue had been slowly releasing his potential.
 At his cultivation level, the bloodline of his descendants could be controlled, but not too much. For example, if Han Jue chose Han Tuo, he couldn’t choose other children to inherit his bloodline. Otherwise, it would be up to fate. This was also why among so many powerful experts, there was usually only one child who was top-notch; usually even none.
 This was related to the Heavenly Dao rules. The Heavenly Dao would suppress the bloodline inheritance, causing each generation to be inferior.
 If everyone had potential like the Dao Ancestor, the Heavenly Dao would have long been overturned.
 The reason why Han Jue nurtured Han Tuo was to see if he could nurture him into a Primordial Fiendcelestial.
 Logically speaking, he was a Primordial Fiendcelestial and was not controlled by the Heavenly Dao. It should be possible.
 “I’m the Great Loose Heaven. I created the first mortal world in the Heavenly Dao, the Great Loose Heaven. It is located below the Immortal World. All living beings can move here. There are no battles, no conflicts, and no contest for providence!”
 A voice resounded through the world. If it could spread through the entire Immortal World, its owner was at least a Zenith Heaven Realm existence.
 Han Jue saw a pillar of light descend from the sky and land at the end of the horizon.
 It was Heavenly Dao Merit!
 Han Jue understood that the era of the heavens was coming.
 With the first, there would be a second!
 Han Jue closed his eyes and didn’t think too much.
 It had nothing to do with him!
 Seventy years later.
 Zhou Fan had reached the Zenith Heaven Realm. His aura shocked the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 His breakthrough was not surprising, but it also made the Hundred Peak Immortal River lively for a period of time.
 In less than thirty years, Dao Comprehension Sword had also successfully stepped into the Zenith Heaven Realm!
 Excluding the guards, the Hidden Sect had a total of five Zenith Heavens. Li Xuan’ao, Dao Sovereign, Zhao Xuanyuan, Zhou Fan, and Dao Comprehension Sword.
 After Han Jue attained the Dao, everyone who cultivated the Great Dao of Extreme Origin could speed up their comprehension. Now, the entire Hidden Sect was on the same boat. The higher Han Jue reached, the more the others were dragged along.
 Li Xuan’ao, Dao Sovereign, Zhao Xuanyuan, and Zhou Fan often sparred. Dao Comprehension Sword still maintained her cultivation attitude.
 The most agitated was Jiang Yi. He felt that he had fallen behind.
 Although his physical potential was strong, his comprehension was inferior to Dao Sovereign, Zhao Xuanyuan, Zhou Fan, and Dao Comprehension Sword.
 On this day.
 Jiang Yi found him.
 Han Jue said, “I know why you’re here. Actually, you don’t have to be anxious. Your cultivation speed is already fast enough, even far beyond before. Perhaps you can catch up to them if you relax. I think this is best for you.”
 Jiang Yi was extremely touched.
 The friendship created from storytelling from back then was still there!
 After sending him away, Han Jue focused on the person he really valued the most. Li Daokong!
 After reaching the Pseudo-Sage Realm, Li Daokong still cultivated diligently. It had to be said that his comprehension was the best in the Hidden Sect.
 No wonder he was chosen as the Human School’s eldest disciple.
 “There’s hope of becoming a Sage before the next Immeasurable Calamity.”
Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m Han Jue thought silently.
 In the future, some mighty figures would create mortal worlds.
 Five hundred years later.
 Han Jue calculated. There were already more than a hundred mortal worlds. The era of the heavens had already taken form.
 However, most of the mortal worlds were still barren. There were no living beings.
 While cultivating, Han Jue checked his emails.
 (Your good friend, the Heavenly Emperor, was attacked by an Inauspicious Evil.]
 (Your good friend Jiang Dugu was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure and was severely injured.)
 (Your good friend Empress Houtu was cursed by a mysterious curse.)
 (Your disciple Yang Tiandong was attacked by demons] x18292
 (Your good friend Jing Tiangong has cursed too many times. His negative karma is pestering him and he has developed mental demons.]
 (Your good friend Zhang Guxing has accepted your son Han Tuo as his disciple.]
 (Your good friend Primordial Chaos Heavenly Devil was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure.]
 (Your good friend Huang Zuntian obtained a Heavenly Dao Supreme Treasure by chance. His providence has increased greatly.]
 Chaos!
 It was chaotic again!
 The familiar circle of friends returned.
 Han Jue wasn’t afraid. Instead, he was gloating
 Huang Zuntian was really something. He could actually find a Heavenly Dao Supreme Treasure?
 Han Jue felt that it was not a coincidence. It must be a trap. It depended on whether Huang Zuntian could see through it.
 “Sigh, cultivation speed after becoming a Sage is so slow.”
 Han Jue looked at the emails and sighed.
 Although he could sense that his Great Dao of Extreme Origin was becoming stronger, he was still very far from the mid-stage Primordial Chaos Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm. He would probably not be able to break through in ten thousand years.
 “Fellow Daoist Han Jue, can you come to the 33rd Heaven?”
 A voice entered Han Jue’s ears.
 It was the Devil Race’s Sage, Emperor Xiao.
 Han Jue immediately replied, “Thank you for your kind intentions, Sage. However, I’ve been comprehending a Mystical Power recently and don’t have time to go out for the time being. I hope that you won’t blame me.”
 “Yes, comprehending the Dao is important. Come when you’re free. I have an opportunity to share with you.”
 “Thank you. Wait for me.”
 “Mm.”
 Fortuitous encounter? To hell with it!
 Trying to trick me?
 Han Jue secretly felt disdain. It was impossible to go out.
 Ever since he knew that the Heavenly Dao had developed a spirit, Han Jue decided not to go out easily.
 Even if Emperor Xiao did not hate him, he had to be careful.
 At the same time.
 Outside the 33rd Heaven.
 Emperor Xiao meditated with a solemn expression. A black shadow floated in front of him. It was mysterious and ghastly.
 “It’s normal for him not to come. There’s a reason why he can secretly attain the Dao,” the black shadow said softly.
