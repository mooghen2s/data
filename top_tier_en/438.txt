 After Zhao Xuanyuan experienced the simulation trial, he became low profile. Compared to Han Jue’s opponents, he was still weak as a mortal.
 As he learned more about Li Yao, Tu Ling’er, Chu Shiren, and the others, Zhao Xuanyuan also felt a sense of danger.
 These disciples were actually so young. They weren’t even ten thousand years old. Their talent was terrifying.
 He had heard of Jiang Yi’s talent. He was even more famous than him and had also entered the Hidden Sect. He was very curious about Han Jue’s identity, but he didn’t dare to ask.
 In a few years, peace returned to Hidden Sect Island. The disciples cultivated separately. Han Jue was also focused on cultivating.
 Tackling the late-stage of the Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm!
 Although he was still far from breaking through, Han Jue felt that it was not impossible to reach the Pseudo-Sage Realm before the Immeasurable Calamity ended.
 Looking at the calamity’s trend, who knew how long it would last.
 Forty years later.
 The Hidden Sect Island was attacked by an Inauspicious Evil that retreated an hour later again.
 Zhao Xuanyuan couldn’t help but become curious about Hidden Sect Island. Could this island be a Dharma treasure?
 On this day.
 Han Jue, who was cultivating, was interrupted by a notification.
 [Detected that the Immortal World is filled with negative karma. A Sage has forcefully entered the calamity, so all living beings will face the calamity. You have the following choices:)
 (1: Enter the calamity immediately and challenge the Sage. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment.]
 [2: Cultivate in a low-profile manner and you can obtain a Mystical Power inheritance.]
 A Sage forcefully entered the calamity?
 So impressive?
 Han Jue was secretly glad that he wasn’t in the Immortal World.
 Unfortunately, the reward for Choice 2 did not have a Great Dao Fragment.
 (You chose to cultivate in a low-profile manner and obtained a Mystical Power inheritance.)
 [Congratulations on obtaining the Dao Destruction Mystical Power— Life of All]
 (Life of All: Dao Destruction Mystical Power, Destiny Mystical Power. Sacrifice one’s cultivation and providence in exchange for the death of all living beings. The living beings here refer to those below the user’s cultivation level and can only be used under a certain Heavenly Dao or Immeasurable Calamity. The price is that one’s cultivation level will decrease by a major realm.]
 Eh?
 So cruel?
 However, dropping a major realm was too exaggerated. Furthermore, using this Mystical Power consumed providence.
 Furthermore, it could only destroy living beings below his cultivation level. It was a little useless.
 Forget it.
 He would learn it first. Having more skills did not burden him.
 Han Jue began to inherit the Dao Destruction Mystical Power.
 Boom
 A terrifying black pillar of light descended from the sky and landed on the Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain. The Hidden Sect disciples who were cultivating turned to look at the Connate Cave Abode.
 Zhao Xuanyuan’s eyes widened in fear. What’s this?
 The black pillar of light terrified him, a Deity Realm existence.
 The Black Hell Chicken looked at Chu Shiren and asked, “Why aren’t you speaking? Tell everyone about it!”
 Chu Shiren frowned and did not answer.
 Clearly, he didn’t know either.
 In a dark hall, Li Muyi, who was meditating, suddenly opened his eyes. “Dao Destruction…”
 “Who is it?”
 Li Muyi frowned and started to deduce with his fingers.
 At this moment, two figures appeared in front of him. They were South Extreme Heavenly Venerate and Sect Master Tian Jue.
 Sect Master Tian Jue said, “Senior, do you feel it? Someone has comprehended a Dao Destruction Mystical Power at this juncture.” South Extreme Heavenly Venerate snorted. “It must be Fuxitian. This fellow forcefully entered the calamity and used his cultivation as a Sage to suppress the Heavenly Court. He’s simply shameless. If he uses the Dao Destruction Mystical Power, he can destroy the world in one go and end the Immeasurable Calamity.”
 Li Muyi’s expression darkened.
 The leaders of the three schools of the Dao Sect had all entered the calamity. If Fuxitian destroyed the world, their providence would be greatly damaged. As Heavenly Dao Sages, their providence would affect their cultivation. Although Li Muyi wasn’t a Heavenly Dao Sage, his disciples were still facing the calamity.
 “In that case, all of you can enter the calamity too,” Li Muyi said with a low voice.
 Hearing this, South Extreme Heavenly Venerate and Sect Master Tian Jue were moved.
 Sect Master Tian Jue frowned and said, “Once we enter the calamity, our killing intent will rise. We Heavenly Dao Sages will also fight to the death.”
 Li Muyi said, “If you don’t enter the calamity, we’ll have to wait for Fuxitian to devour our providence.”
 South Extreme Heavenly Venerate said, “Perhaps it’s not Fuxitian. There’s no need for him to comprehend such a damaging Mystical Power after entering the calamity. Fuxitian doesn’t have any backing.” Li Muyi and Sect Master Tian Jue felt that it made sense and nodded.
 “No matter who it is, they will determine the direction of the Immeasurable Calamity. I have to personally make a trip. Two Heavenly Dao Sages have grasped the Dao Destruction Mystical Power. Ask them.” Li Muyi stood up and said with a solemn tone.
 Immortal World, Human Race.
 On a huge altar, a human cultivator sat in a formation.
 Countless cultivators were meditating and stopping around the altar. Everyone’s gaze descended onto a sea of clouds above the altar.
 Above the sea of clouds, golden light shone brightly. A figure was meditating and preaching, his Dao voice echoing through the world.
 This person wore a black and white robe and had a dignified expression. He was the Human Race’s Sage, Fuxitian.
 Fuxitian opened his eyes and frowned. Although he didn’t open his mouth, his Dao voice echoed endlessly.
 “Dao Destruction Mystical Power… Who is it…”
 Fuxitian pinched his fingers to deduce. Like Li Muyi, he couldn’t deduce that mysterious mighty figure.
 His heart sank.
 The Dao Destruction Mystical Power could overturn all living beings. Even Sages couldn’t stop it.
 If the other party was a Sage, he could destroy all living beings in the Heavenly Dao with a thought, and the Human Race would also die. Then, everything he had done would be in vain. His own status would even become unstable as a Sage.
 “Damn it, I just entered the calamity and someone already comprehended a Dao Destruction Mystical Power… Could it be that those two taught someone?”
 Fuxitian frowned even harder, feeling extremely frustrated.
 Sages had calm minds, but when it involved their own cultivation, it was difficult for them to maintain their cool.
 Connate Cave Abode.
 It took Han Jue seven days and seven nights to master the Dao Destruction Mystical Power. The black pillar of light on the peak of the mountain dissipated.
 “How domineering, complicated, and useless.”
 Han Jue muttered to himself. His mood was average.
 Life of All sounded terrifying, but if Han Jue used it, he could only kill living beings below the mid-stage Golden Immortal Realm. It was meaningless.
 After using it, his cultivation level would fall to the Deity Realm.
 Han Jue didn’t want his cultivation realm to fall at all.
 If he used Life of All after attaining the Dao and became a Sage but directly fell to the Pseudo-Sage Realm, his Dao heart would explode.
 Unless it was absolutely necessary, he absolutely couldn’t use this Mystical Power!
 He continued to cultivate.
 Little did he know that the circle of the Heavenly Dao Sages was already in chaos.
 In a strong light.
 The nine figures sat together. They were all in the light, not allowing their true appearance to be seen.
 Fuxitian was the first to speak. “Which fellow Daoist has comprehended the recent Dao Destruction Mystical Power? Although we Heavenly Dao Sages are fighting, we are only plotting.” Sect Master Tian Jue snorted. “It’s probably not the nine of us. It should be a puppet supported by a fellow Daoist. After all, such a Mystical Power will threaten the Sage’s position too.”
 The Sages spoke one after another. “The Dao Ancestor only taught Qiu Xilai and Daoist Fated Secrets the Dao Destruction Mystical Power. It can only be the two of you plotting.” “Our Buddhist Sect preached the Dao to the myriad heavens. How can we use the Dao Destruction Mystical Power to threaten our lineage?”
 “I won’t, either. My inheritance has long left the Immortal World. Why would I want to be affected by great karma?”
VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience “Ever since the Dao Ancestor left, there have been several Immeasurable Calamities. No Dao Destruction Mystical Power has appeared. This is not normal. We have to be careful.”
