 Heavenly Venerate Wufa didn’t use the array formation to stop him.
 Han Jue walked forward slowly, but each step covered an extremely long distance. It had the profundity of shrinking the distance.
 Soon, he saw Heavenly Venerate Wufa.
 The other party sat on a tall tower. He was high and mighty as he looked down on him.
 Han Jue clearly felt a mysterious force surging around him.
 This fellow was activating the array formation, wanting to isolate the palace from the outside.
 Han Jue stopped and took a deep breath. “Heavenly Venerate Wufa, I came here to acknowledge you as my master.”
 Hearing this, Heavenly Venerate Wufa narrowed his eyes and asked, “Really?”
 He thought that Han Jue was here to find trouble.
 He didn’t completely trust his words.
 Previously, Han Jue had canceled out his palm strike, which meant that he was not weak.
 Han Jue said, “I used my strength to attain the Dao and don’t want to enter the Heavenly Dao Calamity. It’s a good thing for me if you can unite the Heavenly Dao. I can cultivate in peace and not be disturbed.”
 Heavenly Venerate Wufa asked, “Really?”
 “Yes.”
 “Then kneel down.”
 Han Jue cursed silently. This dog really knew how to take advantage of others.
 His legs began to curve as if he was about to kneel down.
 Just as he bent down, he suddenly attacked.
 A Fiendcelestial Dharma idol suddenly appeared above Han Jue’s head. It moved like lightning and pounced at Heavenly Venerate Wufa like a hungry tiger.
 Heavenly Venerate Wufa raised his palm and struck, but the Fiendcelestial Dharma idol was faster and quickly drowned him.
 Imprisonment Fiendcelestial!
 This was one of the Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols that Han Jue had recently comprehended. It could imprison everything in the world, even the Heavenly Dao and Great Dao.
Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m The Heavenly Venerate Wufa’s Dharmic powers were completely useless against the Imprisonment Fiendcelestial.
 His expression changed drastically. He immediately took out a white sword. At this moment, Han Jue rushed in.
 Behind him were Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols that gathered on the Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial at the front. Han Jue waved his fist, and the Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial followed suit.
 A terrifying killing intent attacked. Heavenly Venerate Wufa’s eyes widened as he waved his sword to block.
 Boom
 The figure of the Imprisonment Fiendcelestial began to expand like a balloon that was quickly injected with gas before exploding. The strong wind that stirred up wreaked havoc in the palace. The daytime sky was torn apart and the water at the bottom shattered like a mirror.
 From the outside, Wufa Palace shook violently. Streaks of rainbow light shot out from the palace, bright and dazzling.
 The Sages in the Buddhist Dao Field waited nervously.
 Although they knew that Han Jue was very strong, they were not afraid of accidents.
 Inside Wufa Palace.
 The Imprisonment Fiendcelestial had already dissipated. The wind circled in the hall. It was visible to the naked eye. Dense spatial cracks appeared in the white sky, making one’s heart palpitate.
 Han Jue stood on the platform, holding the Heavenly Venerate Wufa’s Sage Soul.
 Heavenly Venerate Wufa was suppressed by the power of the Imprisonment Fiendcelestial, Void Fiendcelestial, Hell Fiendcelestial, and many others, making it impossible for him to move.
 He looked at Han Jue in shock and asked, “Who are you?”
 He had never encountered a battle like this before. Where did those Dharma Idols come from?
 Han Jue said calmly, “I just want to protect the Heavenly Dao order left behind by the Dao Ancestor.”
 Dao Ancestor?
 Heavenly Venerate Wufa’s expression changed.
 He gritted his teeth and said, “I’m a Heavenly Dao Sage. You can’t kill me. I have a mighty figure behind me. I advise you to give up!”
 Han Jue asked, “Your master is stronger than the Dao Ancestor?”
 Heavenly Venerate Wufa was silent.
 Han Jue retracted his hand and disappeared into the hall.
 He directly came to the Hundred Peak Immortal River’s Dao Field and threw Heavenly Venerate Wufa into the Primordial Heavenly Prison.
 To prevent the other party from doing anything, Han Jue decided not to cultivate and kept staring at him!
 Heavenly Venerate Wufa was suppressed. He shouted, “What? You want to imprison me? Can you imprison me for a lifetime?”
 Han Jue ignored him.
 He would leave the answer to time.
 Outside the 33rd Heaven.
 The Sages arrived at the Wufa Palace. Li Muyi also came.
 Li Muyi frowned and said, “There’s the aura of battle. Why don’t I see the two of them?”
 No one replied.
 The Sages began to check around.
 Li Muyi was secretly annoyed and extremely unhappy.
 Ever since he returned, the Sages had ostracized him. However, when he thought of how he had indeed not contributed in the Heavenly Devil Calamity, he could understand, so he had been enduring.
 The Sages wandered around for a while. After confirming that Han Jue and Heavenly Venerate Wufa were not around, they could only give up.
 Several decades later, Qiu Xilai visited Han Jue in his dreams.
 Han Jue ignored him.
 Qiu Xilai didn’t dare to continue. He thought that Han Jue was still fighting with Heavenly Venerate Wufa and didn’t dare to disturb him.
 Time passed.
 After the lecture ended, the Wufa Sect grew rapidly. In less than a thousand years, the Wufa Sect’s disciples appeared everywhere in the myriad worlds.
 The Sages didn’t dare to act recklessly without knowing Heavenly Venerate Wufa’s life and death.
 In the blink of an eye.
 Two thousand years passed. Han Jue and Heavenly Venerate Wufa had already disappeared for two thousand years. The Sages grew bold and arranged for their disciples to enter the world to target the Wufa Sect.
 Without Heavenly Venerate Wufa’s appearance, the sect had no unity and crumbled in less than a hundred years.  In a deep mountain.
 Han Tuo meditated in the cave abode and cultivated. Ever since the trip to the Wufa Palace, he had been hiding here and cultivating. His cultivation level had increased exponentially.
 Jie Yu suddenly walked in from the entrance and said, “The Wufa Sect is no more. It seems that something has happened to Heavenly Venerate Wufa.”
 Han Tuo opened his eyes when he heard this.
 He couldn’t help but think of the divine light figure he had seen that day.
 Could it be that Heavenly Venerate Wufa’s disappearance was related to that person?
 Han Tuo teased, “Your plan to join the Wufa Sect has failed. What’s next?”
 Jie Yu found a seat and sat down. He shrugged and said, “I’m preparing to leave the Immortal World.”
 “Where to?”
 “An unknown land. If fate allows, we’ll meet again.”
 Han Tuo was silent.
 He didn’t have many good friends. Jie Yu was his confidant. Although he couldn’t see through him, he had indeed helped him a lot. The two of them had experienced life and death together.
 Jie Yu said meaningfully, “Han Tuo, you’re not simple. It’s just that the path of cultivation is still long. I hope that the next time we meet, you’ll already be an influential figure below the Heavenly Dao.”
 Han Tuo frowned and asked, “Must you leave?”
 “That’s right. My mission is over.”
 “Where are you from?”
 “I can’t say. Let’s discuss the Dao. This is also the last time.”
 “Alright!”
 Han Tuo wasn’t pretentious. He was no longer the immature youth from back then.
 Several years later, Jie Yu left.
 Han Tuo also left and entered seclusion in another cave abode.
 Inside the Daoist temple.
 A line of words suddenly appeared in front of Han Jue.
 [Primordial Heavenly Prison has successfully enslaved the target.)
 (Heavenly Venerate Wufa has a favorable impression of you. Current favorability: Max.]
 Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief.
 It took him three thousand years to enslave Heavenly Venerate Wufa. He had not cultivated for three thousand years.
 He had never wasted so much time, causing him to feel extremely tormented and uncomfortable.
 Han Jue checked the emails and saw an interesting one.
 [Your good friend Heavenly Venerable Wufa was abandoned by the Heavenly Dao and lost his position as a Heavenly Dao Sage.]
