 Han Zuitian frowned. His expression changed slightly as he muttered to himself.
 The old man smiled and said, “That’s right, it’s the Earth God appointed by the Heavenly Race. It’s also your blessing that I came to the Hundred Peak Immortal River.”
 Blessing?
 Han Zuitian was immediately furious and scolded, “Screw off. Are you even worthy?”
 His language was inherited from Han Jue. He spoke like him and cursed similarly.
 The reason why he was moved just now was that he had never heard of the Heavenly Race.
 Most of the living beings did not know about the high and mighty Heavenly Race, and the disciples of the Hidden Sect who knew about it had a huge difference in seniority with Han Zuitian. They couldn’t be bothered to acknowledge him, let alone talk about the current Immortal World.
 The Earth God was stunned. He didn’t expect Han Zuitian to suddenly fall out with him.
 Immediately after, his old face turned red. He pointed at him and said with a trembling voice, “You… How impudent!”
 Han Zuitian cursed. “Get lost! Are you qualified to be our Hidden Sect’s blessing? Do you believe that I’ll call for help?”
 The Earth God trembled in anger, but he was really afraid that Han Zuitian would call for help. The Hidden Sect was famous for its viciousness. If not for the orders of the Heavenly Race, he wouldn’t dare to come.
 He stomped his feet and tunneled underground, disappearing.
 Han Zuitian snorted disdainfully.
 Han Zuitian didn’t spread the news of the Earth God in the Hidden Sect. The disciples did not know about it.
 Han Jue was still cultivating in seclusion.
 Ever since he reached the perfected Pseudo-Sage Realm, Han Jue had been excited about cultivation.
 He wanted to reach the Sage Realm as soon as possible!
 Time passed. Everything changed. When he looked back, it was as if everything happened in an instant.
 1,500 years passed.
 Han Jue was still far from attaining the Dao, but he was much stronger than before.
 On this day, he explained the Great Dao to the Hidden Sect again.
 After so many lectures, without the Hidden Sect expanding, all the disciples had already embarked on the cultivation path of the Great Dao of Extreme Origin.
 The Great Dao of Extreme Origin contained extremely great power. Even Li Daokong, who was already a Pseudo-Sage, could easily enter the Dao. After so many years of cultivation, his Dao Fruit had already transformed into the Dao Fruit of the Great Dao of Extreme
 Origin.
 The disciple Han Jue looked forward to the most now was Li Daokong. His expectations for him had already surpassed Dao Sovereign, Li Yao, Zhao Xuanyuan, and the others.
 Of course, he could only hide this thought in his heart and not say it out loud.
 After all, he thought highly of every disciple!
 Han Jue was about to return to the Daoist temple when he suddenly felt something. He raised his hand and waved it, summoning the Strange Deity from outside the Dao Field.
 After so many years, the Strange Deity had indeed become much stronger.
F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com Han Jue could sense that the power it contained was enough to destroy an ordinary Pseudo-Sage.
 What had this fellow done?
 The Strange Deity was clearly very excited to see Han Jue again. It stuck to him and rubbed against him.
 Han Jue played with it for a while and let it move around.
 The current Strange Deity could already control his strength and would not threaten the other living beings in the Hidden Sect.
 Just as he returned to the Daoist temple, Han Jue received a dream from a Sage.
 (Sect Master Tian Jue sent you a dream. Do you accept it?]
 Ignore!
 I want to see if you’re as anxious as Emperor Xiao and Qiu Xilai.
 Han Jue thought to himself and meditated.
 Indeed, not all Sages were as shameless as Qiu Xilai. Sect Master Tian Jue only visited once in his dreams.
 Several months later.
 [Fang Liang sent you a dream. Do you accept it?]
 Fang Liang?
 Han Jue opened his eyes with a strange expression.
 In the past, it was always Sages who visited him in his dreams. When did Fang Liang learn this ability?
 After thinking about it, Han Jue chose to accept it.
 After entering the dream, Han Jue could clearly sense the structure of the dream. It was extremely weak, and he could shatter the dream with a thought.
 Fang Liang was still very weak.
 The dream place was the Numinous Palace. Fang Liang saw Han Jue and immediately walked over to bow.
 The Sun and Moon Yin-Yang Protection behind Han Jue emitted a divine light, preventing Fang Liang from seeing his expression.
 Fang Liang said, “I rashly disturbed Grandmaster because of something important.”
 Han Jue replied, “Oh?”
 “Ji Xianshen has been suppressed. The Heavenly Race has secretly changed to a new master. More than a thousand years ago, the Heavenly Race once sent the Earth God to the Hundred Peak Immortal River. In the end, he was humiliated. Recently, the Heavenly Race has been preparing to deal with the Hundred Peak Immortal River. Ji Xianshen asked me to tell you about this.”
 “That’s it?”
 Han Jue was disdainful.
 He already treated Sages as his enemies. Who dared to find trouble with him?
 It wasn’t that Han Jue was arrogant, but that he was so strong!
 Fang Liang said, “Grandmaster, don’t be careless. The Heavenly Race is mixed with all sorts of people and involves too many factions. Not only that, but recently, someone from the Human Race has also been stirring up rumors about the Hidden Sect. They say that the Hidden Sect once harmed the Human Race and seem to want to defame the Hidden Sect as the Devil Race.”
 Han Jue shook his head and said, “You don’t have to worry about the Hidden Sect. You’ve been away for too long and don’t know the situation anymore.” Upon hearing that, Fang Liang asked carefully, “May I know how many Deity Realm experts the Hidden Sect has?”
 The current Fang Liang was already a Deity Realm existence. If not for the Heavenly Court’s defeat in the calamity, his cultivation would not have increased.
 Han Jue hesitated for a moment and then said, “More than you think.”
 After all, Fang Liang came from the Hidden Sect and had helped the Hidden Sect disciples in the Heavenly Court many times. Han Jue still hoped that he could repent and return to the sect to cultivate.
 Although Fang Liang was already the Dao Ancestor’s successor, Zhou Fan was still a Dharma idol of the Seven Dao Sage. Han Jue wasn’t afraid of people with powerful backgrounds entering the Hidden Sect.
 It was fine as long as it was not the true body of a Sage!
 Fang Liang was silent.
 He clenched his fists in his sleeves.
 He wanted to say that he would return to the Hidden Sect, but the words were stuck in his throat and difficult to say.
 Han Jue didn’t understand what he was worried about and said meaningfully, “As long as you want to return, come back at any time. You don’t have to worry about any trouble. Don’t wait until you’re standing opposite the Hidden Sect before you want to return. At that time, don’t blame Grandmaster for being heartless.”
 Fang Liang took a deep breath. He knew that Han Jue was not joking.
 Han Jue treated him very well, but he was never merciful to enemies.
 Back in the mortal world, Han Jue, who was only a mortal, dared to challenge the Heavenly Court!
 The current Han Jue was naturally not afraid of Sages!
 Fang Liang was in a dilemma.
 Han Jue waved his hand and shattered the dream, leaving only one sentence: “If you don’t return now, no one in the Hidden Sect will remember you.”
 His consciousness returned to the Daoist temple. Han Jue didn’t think too much and continued cultivating.
 It was his decision whether Fang Liang would return.
 Han Jue had already done what he could. He couldn’t force Fang Liang to return. In that case, would he be the Grandmaster or an actual father?
 On that day.
 Li Xuan’ao came to visit him.
 Han Jue let him enter the Daoist temple.
 Li Xuan’ao came in front of him and bowed. “Sect Master, I want to take in a disciple. It’s one of the Four Chaotic Monkeys, the Long-arm Ape. He’s talented, and I’m confident that I can teach him to become a Zenith Heaven or even stronger.
 “By the way, Sect Master, there might be an entire race of Long-arm Apes. I have a bold thought.”
 Long-arm Ape?
 Han Jue raised his eyebrows. He couldn’t help but think of Journey to the West. This monkey was not only in the Journey to the West but also in the Investiture of the Gods.
