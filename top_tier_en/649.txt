 He remembered that Li Daokong was also from the Hidden Sect… Then, he thought of Long Hao’s words. Was this fellow really not bragging? Could Li Daokong really have to bow down to his master?
𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m Long Hao said helplessly, “There are some things that I can’t say clearly, understand? I actually don’t think highly of the humans. It’s just Han Yu. You should know who Han Yu’s master is.” The human mighty figures were moved. It was all thanks to Li Daokong that the Human Race could be where they were today. They had naturally tried their best to collect Li Daokong’s legends and had even spread them in the race.
 Li Daokong was a cultivator of the Hidden Sect! The Sect Master of the Hidden Sect was the high and mighty Immeasurable Merit Divine Might Heavenly Sage! Human Emperor said excitedly, “Thank you for the opportunity the Hidden Sect has given us. We humans are willing to help you subdue the Dragon Race!”
 Long Hao smiled. “In that case, go get ready. We’ll leave at any time.”
 “Alright!”
 The Human Emperor and the mighty figures immediately left. They were clearly very excited, thinking that they had boarded the Hidden Sect’s bus. After they left, Han Yu frowned and asked, “The Hidden Sect has taken a liking to the humans?”
 If that was the case, Li Daokong would definitely give him an order, but he did not. He suspected that Long Hao was bluffing. However, it had to be said that the banner of the Hidden Sect was too attractive. The Hidden Sect had many branches. They went from the Heavenly Race to the Nine Nether. If they could obtain their protection, the Human Race would be safe. Long Hao smiled. “Don’t worry, I won’t trick
 you.”
 Han Yu looked at him deeply.
 “Your master is the master of the Hidden Sect?” “Mm.”
 “Then, what’s my master’s identity in the Hidden
 Sect?”
 “First Guardian.” “My master is really powerful.” “Hehe.”
 “You’re not convinced? I’ll tell my master!” “No, I’m convinced. I’m most convinced by Li Daokong!”
 A thousand years later. Han Jue opened his eyes again and checked his emails habitually. [Your good friend Evil Heavenly Emperor was attacked by a mysterious Dao Devil] x892048
 (Your son Han Tuo was attacked by an Inauspicious Evil] x10928327 (Your disciple Yang Tiandong was cursed by a mysterious curse.] (Your good friend Ancestor Xitian was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure.] (Your grand-disciple Fang Liang dreamed of the Dao Ancestor when he was cultivating. His cultivation has increased greatly.) (Your disciple Zhou Fan obtained the dream of your enemy, Seven Dao Sage, and left the Heavenly Dao.] (Your good friend Empress Houtu was attacked by a mysterious force and was severely injured.)
 Han Tuo was beaten up along with the Evil Heavenly Emperor?
 Han Jue’s heart didn’t ache. He even wanted to laugh.
 He thought of the previous calamity and often saw the immortals of the Heavenly Court being beaten. Needless to say, it was quite interesting. He believed that the Evil Heavenly Emperor would treat Han Tuo well.
 After all, he had deduced the future.
 Han Jue continued reading. Seven Dao Sage and the Dao Ancestor were both moving. It was unknown what they were plotting. Forget about Fang Liang. Now that he had become the Dao Ancestor, Han Jue couldn’t be bothered with him.
 But why did Zhou Fan leave the Heavenly Dao? As for Empress Houtu, she was severely injured in the netherworld?
 Han Jue continued reading.
 After a while, he finished reading the emails and first visited Zhou Fan in his dreams. Zhou Fan was his highly regarded disciple. He couldn’t ignore him. He had to at least put on a show for the Seven Dao Sage. In the dream.
 Zhou Fan suddenly opened his eyes and looked around in horror. Han Jue asked, “What’s wrong?” Zhou Fan saw that it was him and hurriedly said, “Master, don’t visit my dreams. I’m fighting!” Han Jue immediately extinguished the Dark Nightmare and checked the emails.
 (Your disciple Zhou Fan was attacked by an Inauspicious Evil and was severely injured.) (Your disciple Zhou Fan was attacked by an Inauspicious Evil. His body was destroyed and his soul was about to disperse.) (Your disciple Zhou Fan was protected by your enemy, Seven Dao Sage. His injuries have healed and he has revived again.) Han Jue looked at the three emails that appeared one after another and couldn’t help but be silent.
 Oops…
 It seemed that he had to be more cautious next time.
 The Dark Nightmare was a Great Dao Mystical Power that could forcefully drag people into a dream, but the other party might die if they were in battle.
 Eh?
 That was true…
 Han Jue suddenly thought of something and his eyes lit up. He smiled sinisterly. He could use this to deal with enemies in the future!
 Han Jue stopped thinking and sent a dream to Empress Houtu.
 The dream was the Yellow Spring.
 Han Jue asked first, “Are you fighting?” Empress Houtu was stunned. “No, why do you ask?”
 Han Jue said, “I sent a dream to my disciple just now. He was fighting and almost died because of
 it.”
 Empress Houtu: “…”
 Han Jue remained silent. Empress Houtu was attacked by a mysterious force. The Sages did not react, which meant that this matter was very hidden. How should he ask? “I was injured not long ago. A mysterious existence is spying on the netherworld.” Empress Houtu suddenly sighed. She continued, “I don’t know who the other party is, but his power is very strong and can counteract my power of reincarnation. He’s at least a Freedom Sage. Otherwise, he won’t be able to enter the netherworld.”
 Han Jue said in surprise, “A Freedom Sage shouldn’t be able to break through the power of the Heavenly Dao, right?”. Empress Houtu said, “Perhaps he used some secret technique. His strength is indeed stronger than a Heavenly Dao Sage, but he’s not much stronger. Furthermore, I sense a familiar aura from him, but I can’t remember from where.”
 She was a Sage of Reincarnation. How could she not remember this?
 The other party must have erased karma, preventing Empress Houtu from deducing.
 Han Jue asked in his mind, “I want to know who attacked Empress Houtu?”
 For the sake of others, Han Jue really didn’t want to waste his lifespan. However, if the netherworld was broken, the Heavenly Dao would be in danger.
 (100 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?) Continue!
 A line of words appeared in front of him.
 [Fuxitian: Great Dao Sage, Ancestor of the Human Race, Immeasurable Emperor, Ancestor of the Eight Trigrams]
 Fuxitian!
 Han Jue frowned.
 Why did this fellow become a Great Dao Sage? He didn’t see it in the emails, either. Achieving the Great Dao as soon as he died was not simple.
 This was cheating! Han Jue said, “I have to tell the other Sages about this. If you can’t ask, I’ll go.” Empress Houtu said, “Thank you.” The dream ended. Han Jue directly came to the 33rd Heaven and gathered the other Sages in Sect Master Tian Jue’s Dao Field. He told them about Empress Houtu being attacked
 The Sages were shocked. The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate said in surprise, “Why can’t we sense it?”
 Heavenly Venerate Wufa snorted. “Needless to say, the other party is far stronger than us! He can even avoid the heavenly secrets!”
 The Sages were silent. Fang Liang said, “No, if the other party attacks in the Heavenly Dao, it’s impossible for him to avoid the power of the Heavenly Dao unless he’s a Heavenly Dao lifeform. In addition, the netherworld is the lowest level of the Heavenly Dao.”
 “Heavenly Dao lifeform? Could it be Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du? Only he’s far stronger than us,” the South Extreme Heavenly Venerate added. Han Jue glanced at him. You really know how to guess.
 Han Jue had no choice but to say, “It shouldn’t be Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du. I’ve been contacting him. By the way, did the Sages who died previously really die?”
