 The corners of Yang Du’s mouth curled up in anticipation.
 Twisting his waist, he picked up a silver metal rod placed by the door and walked east.
 At this moment.
 A beam of light descended from the sky and collided with Yang Du’s forehead at an extremely fast speed.
 Yang Du was instantly stunned on the spot. His eyes were unfocused.
 After a long time.
Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m Yang Du opened his eyes. He muttered to himself, “Heavenly Cycle Body Tempering Technique… What is this?”
 Han Jue looked at Yang Du from the sun. Yang Du had no one to rely on. Even if his life was rough, he did not lose his optimism. His optimism was not a pretense. At night, when he was alone, he would look forward to his future and not be sad.
 The Spirit Qi in the Earth Immortal World was insufficient, so Han Jue taught him the Heavenly Cycle Body Tempering Technique. This technique was mainly for body tempering and could attract natural energy to temper the body.
 However, in the later stages, he still had to rely on Spirit Qi. In addition, the Heavenly Cycle Body Tempering Technique was originally suitable for cultivating the Chaotic Physique. After Han Jue’s adaptation, he created the Mortal Physique chapter. In other words, it was very difficult for mortal spirits to unleash its true effect. However, Yang Du would become a Chaotic Fiendcelestial in the future. Cultivating this technique in advance would be considered preparation.
 At that time, Han Jue would move him into the second Dao Field to cultivate.
 Han Jue returned to the main Dao Field and continued cultivating.
 If Yang Du died early, it meant that this child was not tough enough wasn’t worth nurturing.
 Time passed.
 A thousand years passed quickly.
 Han Jue’s understanding of the Great Dao of Extreme Origin became deeper and deeper. He first wanted to create a corporeal existence before fusing it with his body.
 However, Han Jue couldn’t create a physical existence for the Great Dao of Extreme Origin. It was a strange feeling, as if it already existed.
 It was clearly created by him. How could he not know if the Great Dao of Extreme Origin really existed?
 Han Jue had to use the derivation function. “I want to know why the Great Dao of Extreme Origin can’t become a true existence?”
 (100 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?)
 “As expected of the Great Dao I created. Your value is really high!”
 Continue!
 (The Great Dao of Extreme Origin already exists.]
 Stunned, Han Jue subconsciously asked, “Where?”
 This time, his lifespan was not deducted.
 [It’s located in the depths of the chaos. The exact location has already entered your mind.)
 A huge piece of memory appeared in Han Jue’s mind, like a virtual map.
 The Great Dao of Extreme Origin already existed and was still very far from the Immortal World.
 Han Jue showed a frown.
 It was too dangerous to go out alone so far. However, if he didn’t find the Great Dao of Extreme Origin, he wouldn’t be able to become a Freedom Sage.
 Damn it!
 When he created the Great Dao of Extreme Origin, why didn’t he notice that this thing ran so far?
 Han Jue couldn’t help but ask, afraid that there was a conspiracy.
 Another hundred billion years of lifespan were deducted.
 [The Great Dao can only be born in the depths of Chaos.]
 Alright.
 Han Jue began to think about how to find the Great Dao of Extreme Origin.
 If the main Dao Field left the Hundred Peak Immortal River, it would be isolated by the Heavenly Dao if it wanted to enter in the future. He could only use the second Dao Field. In any case, no Fiendcelestials were living in the second Dao Field for the time being.
 Han Jue immediately found the previous Hidden Sect Island, a grain of sand that contained special spatial dimension laws.
 He took Hidden Sect Island and teleported to the second Dao Field, transferring it to the island.
 The next transfer would take a hundred years. A hundred years of cooldown was already considered short for Han Jue.
 After doing all of this, he took back Hidden Sect Island and came to the main Dao Field again.
 It was unknown if it was a blessing or a curse to head into the depths of the chaos this time.
 Han Jue looked at Han Tuo and Han Yu. The two of them were doing well and had different lives.
 The other disciples were also fine. In that case, Han Jue could leave in peace.
 Five hundred years later.
 The array formation of the second Dao Field had already been raised to the level of the main Dao Field. Han Jue prepared to leave.
 He left a clone in the main Daoist temple while his main body entered Hidden Sect Island. Then, he brought Hidden Sect Island to jump into the Dark Forbidden Zone and followed the map memories given by the system.
 The Hidden Sect Island quickly traveled through the Dark Forbidden Zone. It was very hidden.
 As he traveled, Han Jue asked, “Will I encounter an existence that surpasses the limits of the Dao Field’s array formation while I search for the Great Dao of Extreme Origin?”
 (100 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?] Continue!
 [No, but you will encounter mighty figures far beyond you.]
 Han Jue showed a frown.
 It seemed that he had to be careful.
 Sigh.
 Han Jue didn’t want to go at first, but if he couldn’t fuse with the Great Dao of Extreme Origin, he couldn’t become a Freedom Sage. This trip was necessary.
 The speed at which Hidden Sect Island traveled was very fast, but the Dark Forbidden Zone was extremely vast.
 The Dark Forbidden Zone was located in the chaos, but it was extremely far away.
 Han Jue controlled Hidden Sect Island to fly while comprehending the Great Dao of Extreme Origin.
 This was the first time he had truly traveled far. He was very nervous, afraid that something would happen.
 Year after year passed.
 The battle for providence in the Immortal World was still ongoing. No one knew that Han Jue had left, including the Hidden Sect disciples.
 Outside the 33rd Heaven.
 The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate and Sect Master Tian Jue gathered in a Dao Field.
 Sect Master Tian Jue held a bronze mirror. In the mirror appeared a vast world surrounded by endless black mist.
 The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate cursed. “Damn Dark Sage King, is he staring at us?”
 Sect Master Tian Jue’s expression was ashen. “This Little Heavenly Dao should be gone. We’ll make plans later.”
 “But the Dark Sage King has been staring at the Immortal World. It’s useless even if we split open a new world.” “What should I do?”
 “Kill the Dark Sage King!”
 “How? Li Muyi almost died in the Dark Sage King’s hands.”
 “Almost. Li Muyi died in Han Jue’s hands.”
 The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate was silent.
 Although he tried to please Han Jue and thought that he had a good relationship with him, he didn’t dare to look for him.
 If Han Jue determined that he was plotting, wouldn’t he also die?
 The thought of that made the South Extreme Heavenly Venerate shiver.
 Sect Master Tian Jue also had a headache. If he looked for Han Jue regarding this matter, he would definitely be recognized as plotting. Back then, Qiu Xilai and Li Muyi looked for Han Jue to help resist the enemy.
 The two Sages fell silent.
 In the end, they decided to find Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du.
 In the blink of an eye, Han Jue had been out for four hundred years.
 He opened his eyes and dreamed of Immortal Emperor Samsara.
 He knew very well that the main Dao Field had a clone guarding it.
 However, the Reincarnation Space was very far away. Han Jue couldn’t understand the situation. If he arranged for a clone to stay in the Reincarnation Space, it was very easy to expose that he was the mastermind behind it. “How’s the development of the Reincarnation Space going?” Han Jue asked. The Reincarnation Space was divided into two factions. One was Immortal Emperor Samsara, and the other was the Human School of Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du. The two were both managing the Reincarnators, indicating harmony and secretly competing.
 Immortal Emperor Samsara said, “Not bad. Recently, a prodigy appeared in the Reincarnation Space. He himself has learned a special body tempering technique, causing him to be inferior to the other Reincarnators in the early stages. But now, he’s already ranked in the top ten among. Both I and the Human School want to obtain him, but this child has never made a choice.”
