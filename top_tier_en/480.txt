 He had always paid special attention to Han Jue. In the previous calamity, almost all the forces had people related to him.
 Most importantly, Han Jue could protect these people. Even the sinful Su Qi was protected by the Sages.
 Perhaps joining Han Jue was really a bright path.
 However, Hao Tian didn’t know which Sage was supporting him.
 Long Hao smiled and said, “Entering my Hidden Sect might not allow you to show off, but at least you can cultivate in peace. You can also recover your cultivation in peace. When you reach the peak, won’t it be a good thing?”
 Hao Tian pondered for a moment and nodded slowly.
 The Immortal World became more and more lively. The number of ferocious beasts increased, as did the Connate lifeforms.
 The greatest difference between Connate lifeforms and ferocious beasts was that the former had intelligence.
 Most Connate lifeforms could not transform. Those who couldn’t move were often ravaged by ferocious beasts. Those who could run discovered that devouring ferocious beasts could make them stronger.
 Just like that, the conflict between Connate lifeforms and ferocious beasts began to brew.
 Time flew.
 Another thousand years passed.
𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com Han Jue’s cultivation had improved greatly again. Although his speed of improvement was not as fast as before, he felt that it was not bad.
 He had to feel the results before he could move forward with enthusiasm.
 In the past thousand years, the disciples of the Hidden Sect had also improved.
 Diamond Rage and the Black Hell Demon Lord stepped into the Deity Realm one after another and were taught the Great Dao of Extreme Origin by Han Jue.
 More and more people cultivated the Great Dao of Extreme Origin. Han Jue was very satisfied.
 Just with Dao Sovereign and the others cultivating the Great Dao of Extreme Origin, it already made Han Jue feel that it was becoming stronger.
 Although he also needed to comprehend the Great Dao of Extreme Origin, as it was created by him, he could clearly sense that it was becoming stronger.
 On this day.
 Zhou Fan found him.
 “No,” Han Jue said expressionlessly.
 Zhou Fan actually wanted to go out!
 Impossible!
 Zhou Fan frowned. “If we don’t take action, the three regions belonging to the Hidden Sect will definitely be occupied.”
 Han Jue said, “So be it. Cultivate to the Pseudo-Sage Realm first. Before that, don’t even think about leaving.”
 Zhou Fan was the Dharma idol of Seven Dao Sage. He wouldn’t die if he went out, but he would definitely cause trouble.
 Han Jue wanted to suppress Zhou Fan here and let him cultivate the Great Dao of Extreme Origin. As time passed, the Seven Dao Sage could forget about controlling him.
 If Zhou Fan was strong enough, even Seven Dao Sage would no longer dare to target him. If Han Jue died, all the cultivators of the Great Dao of Extreme Origin would suffer, including Zhou Fan.
 “Pseudo-Sage? How long will that take?”
 Zhou Fan’s expression changed. Although he already had the Chaotic Physique, if he wanted to cultivate to the Pseudo-Sage Realm…
 He stared at Han Jue and asked, “You’re already a Pseudo-Sage?”
 “What?”
 “I asked you.”
 “Is this how you talk to your master? It seems like you’ve been a little arrogant recently. Let’s go, we’ll enter the simulation trial!”
 Han Jue didn’t care if Zhou Fan agreed or not and forcefully pulled him into the simulation trial.
 Several days later.
 Zhou Fan walked out of the Daoist temple with a stunned expression. His hands in his sleeves trembled slightly.
 The Black Hell Chicken appeared around him. It was unknown if it was a coincidence, but it asked with a smile, “Brat, what’s wrong?”
 Zhou Fan did not answer. Like a walking corpse, he walked numbly towards his residence.
 News quickly spread.
 The other disciples who wanted to go out also didn’t dare to look for Han Jue.
 They guessed that there might be a drastic change in the world next, so Han Jue didn’t let them out.
 For a time, a tense cultivation wind stirred in the Hidden Sect.
 Ten years later.
 After cursing Sage Fated Secrets, Han Jue walked out of the Daoist temple and started to wander around the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 The Strange Deity followed behind him. Until today, other than Han Jue, no one else could see it.
 Most of the Hidden Sect disciples were cultivating, but one was not. That was Han Zuitian.
 Han Zuitian gathered all the transformed Connate lifeforms in a valley.
 Han Jue came to the peak and quietly watched.
 “What?”
 Han Jue had a strange expression.
 This fellow was…
 Training soldiers?
 Han Zuitian stood at the front. The Connate lifeforms imitated him by punching and raising their legs.
 Interesting
 Han Jue left after watching for a while. He didn’t expect much from Han Zuitian.
 Han Jue went to the Nether Race’s territory next. All the Nether Race members were cultivating and the territory was peaceful.
 He was very satisfied with their attitude.
 At this moment, Han Jue suddenly felt a familiar aura that he hadn’t felt in a long time.
 Long Hao!
 Why was this kid here?
 Han Jue almost forgot about him.
 Long Hao stopped outside the Hundred Peak Immortal River and was hiding somewhere to cultivate.
 Han Jue checked the nearby powerful enemies. The strongest outside the Hundred Peak Immortal River was Long Hao who had One Mystic Divine Origin cultivation.
 After thinking for a moment, Han Jue activated all the Dharma treasures in his body. The Sun and Moon Yin-Yang Protection burst out with divine light and enveloped him.
 In the depths of the cave, Long Hao suddenly felt a strong light. He opened his eyes and looked over. He could only see Han Jue’s figure and couldn’t see his true appearance.
 Long Hao immediately stood up in fear.
 Immediately after, his expression changed. He asked carefully, “Master?”
 Han Jue said, “You still consider me your master?”
 Long Hao hurriedly knelt down and said fearfully, “You’re my master for all eternity!”
 “You even dare to deal with your own father. I really don’t dare to accept you anymore. I’m afraid that you’ll kill your master when you become stronger.”
 Han Jue’s tone was filled with mockery.
 Long Hao said awkwardly, “I was just fighting for power. I had no intention of killing my father. Under my father’s lead, the Heavenly Court had already reached a bottleneck. He stuck to the will of the Dao Ancestor and wanted to maintain the peace of the myriad worlds. He bullied the weak and feared the strong. How could the Heavenly Court develop under him? Even the True Dragons looked down on him.
 “In the past, the four factions—the Heavenly Court, the Divine Palace, the Buddhist Sect, and the Demon Court-acted and always wanted to maintain a balance. However, he was the Heavenly Emperor. How could the Heavenly Emperor be on the same level as others! I thought he was not worthy of being the Heavenly Emperor! He had already lost the domineering aura that a Heavenly Emperor should have!”
 The more Long Hao spoke, the more excited he became. In the end, his eyes turned red.
 Clearly, he had been holding this back for a long time.
 Han Jue interrupted, “I don’t want to care about this or hear about it. I just want to know why you came back.”
 Long Hao gritted his teeth and said, “I want to return to the Hidden Sect.”
 “Hide here for a while before going out to cause more trouble? What do you think the Hidden Sect is?”
 “No… I won’t go out again without your instructions!”
 “Go to the Hundred Peak Immortal River Formation and kowtow. As you kowtow, say that you are wrong. Do that for a thousand years.”
 “Huh?”
 Long Hao was shocked.
 Han Jue ignored him and disappeared.
 Long Hao’s expression changed.
 Hao Tian appeared and sighed. “Pseudo-Sage. Your master is at least a Pseudo-Sage. No wonder. It seems that your information is wrong. Your master can’t be only ten thousand years old!”
 Long Hao said in pain, “I’ve to kneel for a thousand years and still have to admit my mistake. How embarrassing is that?”
 Hao Tian said angrily, “Didn’t you want to come back yourself? You have to pay the price. If I were your master, it wouldn’t be so simple.”
