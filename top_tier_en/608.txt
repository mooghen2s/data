 Han Jue, who had just finished chatting with Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du, appeared. He waved his hand and released the new Dao Field guard.
 Li Muyi’s replica.
 “From now on, your name will be Dong Zhuo,” Han Jue muttered. Dong Zhuo immediately thanked him for his name and left.
 Then, Han Jue looked at Yang Du.
 This fellow had already stepped into the Immortal Realm. Now, he was backed by the twelve Overgods under Immortal Emperor Samsara. Nothing bad should happen to him.
 Han Jue began to screen other suitable candidates.
 Creating Spirit Stones were still very difficult to find. Who knew how long it would take for him to gather all three thousand Create Spirit Stones. Now, he needed 100,000 years to trigger the system’s choice once. As for breaking through, it would only happen once every tens of thousands of years, or even longer.
 Han Jue had to consider a lot about choosing the Fiendcelestial candidates.
 His gaze pierced through the River of Destiny of the Earth Immortal World, observing the past, the present, and the future. Observing a person’s fate could show their character and actions.
 Twenty-seven years later.
 Han Jue chose five candidates and taught them the Heavenly Cycle Body Tempering Technique. He no longer cared about them after that.
 The first stage of becoming a Fiendcelestial candidate was to survive!
 If they couldn’t survive here, how could they be a Chaotic Fiendcelestial?
 Han Jue hoped that they had a firm and mature heart before becoming Chaotic Fiendcelestials and had their own path to take.
 Han Jue returned to the Hundred Peak Immortal River and looked at Han Yu.
 Ever since Li Daokong started his slaughter, Buzhou Divine Mountain had been tainted by the demons as a dangerous place. Few living beings came to worship it. The entire divine mountain was very quiet.
 Han Yu was already a Grand Unity Golden Immortal and was cultivating in a corner of Buzhou Divine Mountain.
 Han Jue’s interest in him suddenly decreased.
 He was tired of seeing this face.
 In any case, this kid had already found a backing. He would let nature take its course in the future.
 Han Jue thought silently.
 In the past, he had wanted to use Han Yu to provoke Han Tuo, but ever since he had gone to the depths of Chaos, he knew that the world outside the Heavenly Dao was still very large. Han Tuo’s opponent would naturally appear. There was no need for him to nurture him.
 Han Jue looked at the Heavenly Race.
Diisscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com The Heavenly Race was the Hidden Sect’s greatest support target, so Han Jue naturally paid attention to them.
 Recently, there had been something wrong with the providence of the Heavenly Race. The Heavenly Dao was faintly rejecting it.
 Han Jue counted with his fingers and went silent.
 It turned out that although the Heavenly Race had become the representative of the Immortal Gods, they did not carry out their duty. Ji Xianshen was busy fighting and expanding the Heavenly Race’s territory, but he had forgotten to care about the living beings under them. When all living beings encountered calamity, they cried for the Heavenly Race but did not receive a reply. It was fine for tens of thousands of living beings, but when this number increased, the people wouldn’t be able to live anymore. If all living beings suffered, it would shake the Heavenly Race’s providence.
 Although the current Immortal World was prosperous, it lacked the most important thing.
 Rules!
 Heavenly Rules!
 Before the Heavenly Dao was restarted, the myriad worlds in the universe used humans as the foundation. Good and evil were the dividing lines. Their sins were deep and they went to the netherworld to atone for their sins. They accumulated good karma for a long time and established themselves as immortals.
 Apart from the lack of clear rules, there were also some unbearable things committed in the Heavenly Race, including the Hidden Sect disciples. This was something that couldn’t be eliminated.
 Han Jue only watched and had no intention of interfering.
 The mortal world was filled with vicissitudes, and all living beings had all sorts of forms. Sages couldn’t control every mortal.
 Han Jue only needed to see the overall situation. If the Heavenly Race he supported became evil, he would correct it. If he couldn’t, he would destroy it and support the new members.
 At this moment, Han Jue suddenly understood the mentality of those Sages in the past.
 The Sage Sects had been destroyed several times before being reorganized. Could it be related to what he wanted?
 Han Jue shook his head and laughed. He stopped thinking about it and started cultivating
 Although he had become a Freedom Sage, he couldn’t become proud and forget to cultivate.
 No matter how talented he was, he had to cultivate diligently and not waste time.
 Year after year passed.
 Another seven hundred years passed in a flash.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du suddenly sent Han Jue a dream, interrupting his cultivation.
 That day, Han Jue set off for the 33rd Heaven. He didn’t alert the others of the Hidden Sect.
 In the Universal Hall.
 When Han Jue arrived, the other Sages were already waiting
 Heavenly Venerate Wufa was expressionless. Qiu Xilai, South Extreme Heavenly Venerate, Sect Master Tian Jue, Fuxitian, and Emperor Xiao nodded slightly at him.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du stood up and said, “The Deity Realm of the Ruins of End has already begun to take action. We should leave. This battle must end quickly to prevent any accidents.”
 The Sages nodded and disappeared from the Universal Hall.
 They arrived at the Dark Forbidden Zone, quickly moving through.
 The aura of a Sage was something that the Dark Forbidden Zone could not conceal. Han Jue mixed into the crowd and didn’t lead the way or end it.
 Qiu Xilai suddenly said, “My subordinate, Primordial Chaos Buddha, was captured by the Dark Sage King. I don’t know if he’s still alive.”
 The moment he spoke, the other Sages also spoke. All the Sages had their subordinates captured. The Dark Sage King had offended them all.
 South Extreme Heavenly Venerate looked at Han Jue and asked, “Fellow Daoist Han, tell us. What are your chances?”
 The Sages turned their heads.
 They had already joined forces to deal with the Dark Sage King before and were not his match. The greatest variable in this operation was Han Jue.
 Han Jue’s speed of killing Li Muyi was faster than the Dark Sage King defeating him. Of course, this was also related to the order. Li Muyi was severely injured by the Dark Sage King first before giving Han Jue a chance.
 No matter what, he was definitely the strongest Sage in the Immortal World.
 Han Jue said, “I’ve never met the Dark Sage King. How can I give a clear answer?”
 Qiu Xilai understood what he meant and said, “Don’t pressure Fellow Daoist Han. When we really fight, we still have to pretend to ignore him. Only then can we give the Dark Sage King a fatal blow.”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “In this battle, I will use the power of freedom. My chances of winning are greater than last time.”
 The Sages smiled.
 With Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du’s words, they were even more confident.
 Then, they began to talk about the Immortal World.
 Darkness fell.
 Han Tuo and Yi Tian leaned against each other and looked at the new prisoners shouting not far away. They had mocking smiles on their faces.
 Yi Tian smiled. “I suddenly recalled the way others looked at us when we got here. I see.”
 Han Tuo sighed. “I’m almost used to it.”
 In the past few years, they had often heard the Dark Sage King preach the Dao. Their cultivation levels had increased very quickly, and Yi Tian could become a Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal at any time.
 “Looks like we all have to work under the Dark Sage King, but it’s alright. In any case, the Dark Sage King is also stronger than the Sages.” Yi Tian smiled teasingly.
 Han Tuo nodded. Time could erase everything. After the prisoners adapted to the dark power and began to become stronger, their mentality also changed.
 No wonder those old prisoners ignored them.
 “You want to give up on the Heavenly Dao?”
 A voice suddenly sounded in Han Tuo’s mind, startling him.
 This voice was not the voice of Calamity’s Vengeful, but the white-robed man they had encountered in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End.
 Han Tuo looked around, wanting to capture the other party’s existence, but he couldn’t see him at all.
 “Stop looking. I’m in your body.”
 The white-robed man spoke again, causing Han Tuo to fall silent.
 What happened? Han Tuo asked in his mind, “What are you doing?”
 The white-robed man said, “I want to kill the Dark Sage King and replace him! Are you willing to help me?”
