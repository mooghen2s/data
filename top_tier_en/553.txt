 In front of the palace, living beings appeared one after another. Most of them had pleasantly surprised expressions before stepping into the door that shone with strong light.
 It was endless!
 An endless stream!
 The space inside the Wufa Palace seemed to be limitless and could contain all living beings in the Immortal World.
 Han Tuo suddenly appeared in front of the Wufa Palace. He looked up, his eyes filled with excitement, anticipation, and a trace of nervousness.
 “Brother Han Tuo, you’re here too.”
 A familiar voice sounded. Han Tuo turned around and said in surprise, “Brother Jie Yu, you’re here too!”
 Jie Yu squeezed through the crowd and walked in front of Han Tuo.
 The two of them were very happy to see each other again.
 After chatting for a while, they stepped into the Wufa Palace.
 Such a scene repeated in front of the Wufa Palace. Because they had come to listen to the Dao, many cultivators had reunited. Of course, enemies also saw each other and were extremely jealous. However, they didn’t dare to act rashly in front of the Sage Dao Field.
 On the other side.
 The Sages gathered in Qiu Xilai’s Dao Field.
 “This fellow is too impudent! What does he want? He directly took in all the living beings of the Heavenly Dao as his disciples. Does he want to control the Heavenly Dao alone?” The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate said angrily, trembling in anger.
 Sect Master Tian Jue’s eyes flickered with a cold light. “It’s indeed too much. He doesn’t care about us at all.”
 Qiu Xilai was also furious. How long had it been since Heavenly Venerate Wufa came?
 Emperor Xiao was also furious. He began to think of a countermeasure.
 At this moment…
 “Everyone, why is there another Sage in the Heavenly Dao?”
 A voice sounded and Li Muyi appeared in the hall.
 Seeing him appear, the Sages’ expressions instantly darkened.
 Li Muyi looked a little tired. Noticing that the atmosphere was not right, he asked, “Could it be that you didn’t support him?”
 The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate said in a strange tone, “Hey, isn’t this the Sage of the Human School? Your Chiliocosm World’s calamity has been resolved?”
 Li Muyi frowned. “No, I’m prepared to abandon the Chiliocosm World.
 “Tell me about that new Sage first. Why are there so many living beings heading to his Dao Field?”
 The Sages looked at each other. In the end, Sect Master Tian Jue told him the reason.
 Li Muyi was furious when he heard that. “Ridiculous! I’ll personally find Heavenly Venerate Wufa!”
 The Sages did not stop him and watched him leave.
 In the Daoist temple of the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 Han Jue, who was cultivating, sensed something and suddenly looked up.
 His gaze pierced through the 33rd Heaven. He saw that Li Muyi and Heavenly Venerate Wufa were fighting
 Their Mystical Powers and Dharmic powers were boundless. It shook the Chaotic Qi of the 33 Heavens until it surged violently. The living beings in front of the palace no longer increased.
 From the looks of the battle, Li Muyi was being suppressed by Heavenly Venerate Wufa.
 Interesting
 Han Jue thought for a moment and took out the Book of Misfortune. He started to curse Heavenly Venerate Wufa. At the very least, he had to make him unable to cultivate in peace.
 It was very difficult to determine a winner in a battle between Sages unless one grasped the power of the Great Dao like Han Jue.
 Five days later.
 Han Jue started to curse with his lifespan.
 He tried his best, his lifespan decreasing rapidly.
 In the midst of the fighting, Heavenly Venerate Wufa’s expression changed drastically. He waved his sleeve, and countless blue ice crystals shot in all directions. They tore through space along the way, preventing Li Muyi from approaching.
 “Curse power. What Mystical Power are you using?” Heavenly Venerate Wufa asked in a low voice. The previous curse did not hurt, but the power of the curse had suddenly strengthened.
 He guessed that Li Muyi had used some Mystical Power.
 Li Muyi ignored his question and continued fighting
 He was also furious. He didn’t want to lose face in front of the other Heavenly Dao Sages.
 At the same time.
 The expressions of the other Sages who were watching the battle became subtle. They communicated with their divine sense.
 “Indeed, it’s him!”
 “We didn’t curse Heavenly Venerate Wufa. That can only be Li Muyi.”
 “Could it be Han Jue?”
 “There’s no need for Han Jue to do that. Furthermore, the person questioned by Heavenly Venerate Wufa is Li Muyi. This means that he sensed that Li Muyi is using a Mystical Power that we can’t see.”
 “How despicable. He even pretended to save me just now!”
 If Li Muyi had the system, he would definitely receive several Hatred Points.
 The battle continued.
 The 33rd Heaven began to collapse. Dense spatial cracks could be seen everywhere. Chaotic lightning interwove in the spatial cracks.
 Heavenly Venerate Wufa was the strongest Heavenly Dao Sage now. Li Muyi had long left the Heavenly Dao. The battle between the two caused the order of the Heavenly Dao to collapse.
 Boom
 Terrifying purple lightning descended from above. It was unknown how long it was, but it seemed to split the entire Chaotic Space outside the 33rd Heaven into two.
 Li Muyi and Heavenly Venerate Wufa immediately dodged in fear.
 Their Dharmic powers were endless and they could still fight for hundreds of millions of years, so their states were very stable.
 Heavenly Venerate Wufa snorted. “Since the Heavenly Dao is interfering, why fight? You can’t defeat me at all!”
 He was very unhappy. If not for the fact that he had sacrificed himself to become a Heavenly Dao Sage, he would have long killed Li Muyi!
 He hadn’t advanced after becoming a Heavenly Dao Sage. Instead, he had declined.
 Li Muyi’s expression was ugly. “Fellow Daoist, this is the Heavenly Dao Immortal World. Don’t you think it’s too much for you to do this as a newcomer?”
 Heavenly Venerate Wufa mocked him. “It’s a great merit for me to preach the Dao to all living beings. How is that too much? If you aren’t convinced, you can ask all living beings. Do you dare to do it?”
 Li Muyi was silent.
 From a living being’s point of view, it was naturally a huge opportunity. However, from the perspective of a Sage, this was not a good thing. Their lineage would be shaken. Not only that, but all living beings would quickly become stronger, causing the Heavenly Dao to be unable to withstand it and trigger another Immeasurable Calamity.
 Heavenly Venerate Wufa flicked his sleeve and left after saying, “Let’s use our own methods in this game.”
 Li Muyi’s face was ashen. He did not chase after him.
 Han Jue touched his chin and pondered.
 Heavenly Venerate Wufa was so arrogant. Who was behind this?
 It shouldn’t be the Dao Ancestor. The Heavenly Dao itself belonged to him. The Sages had all been promoted by the Dao Ancestor.
 “I want to know who instructed Heavenly Venerate Wufa?” Han Jue thought silently.

 A figure appeared in Han Jue’s mind. It was a black-robed youth.
 [Heavenly Sect Master: Great Dao Sage, Immeasurable Emperor, Jie School’s Ancestor]
 Han Jue frowned.
 Why was it the Heavenly Sect Master?
 It made sense that the Heavenly Sect Master was still alive. After all, Nüwa and Dijun were still around.
 However, why did the Heavenly Sect Master not support Sect Master Tian Jue but another Sage?

 Heavenly Venerate Wufa had developed hatred towards Han Jue as soon as he arrived, which meant that it was very difficult for the Heavenly Sect Master to befriend him, so Han Jue asked cleverly.
 (The Heavenly Dao is independent and the Great Dao cannot interfere. The Heavenly Sect Master is still imprisoned in the Ancient Desolate and has lost his freedom.]
 Han Jue was enlightened. So this fellow was locked up.
 He asked, “Is it that even existences beyond the Heavenly Dao can’t directly attack the living beings in the Heavenly Dao?”
 [Not necessarily, unless the cultivation level surpasses Pangu and the Dao Ancestor.]
