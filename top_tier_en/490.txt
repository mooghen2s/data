 Ancient Fiendish Yin had been recuperating ever since he had been severely injured in the Hundred Peak Immortal River. The living beings of the Ancient Race had thought that he had already perished. Now, the Ancient Race was in pieces and all sorts of kings had risen. The Immortal World had also fallen into chaos.
 Cursing Ancient Fiendish Yin only consumed a trillion years of his lifespan.
 [Because of your curse, your enemy Ancient Fiendish Yin suffered from mental demons. His Dharmic powers surged and his Dao Fruit shattered. He died and his Dao dissipated.]
 He was cursed to death!
 Unlike other opponents in the past who Han Jue could only curse to death after many years, Ancient Fiendish Yin was directly cursed to death by him in one go!
 One-shot kill!
 Han Jue wasn’t happy at all. Instead, he was a little melancholic.
 As he became stronger, he could no longer return to the life of having a curse mission that happened once every ten years.
 Han Jue put down the Book of Misfortune and released the Strange Deity. Letting it move freely, he entered a cultivation state.
 Outside the 33rd Heaven.
 Great Ultimate Hall.
 Li Muyi, Fuxitian, South Extreme Heavenly Venerate, Qiu Xilai, Sect Master Tian Jue, Sage Jin’an, and Emperor Xiao knelt in the hall.
 Ancestor Xitian sat in front of them expressionlessly.
 The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate looked up and said, “Ancestor, what do you think about this?”
 The other Sages also stared at him.
 Ancestor Xitian said indifferently, “I’ve already said that I won’t interfere in the matters of the Heavenly Dao.”
 “Sage Fated Secrets has already gone mad. This is no longer a matter of the Heavenly Dao,” Qiu Xilai added. Sage Fated Secrets was the strongest Heavenly Dao Sage previously. He had already gone mad. How could the other Sages remain calm?
ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m In any case, he was panicking.
 Sage Jin’an added, “Sage Fated Secrets has grasped the Dao Destruction Mystical Power. If he goes mad and uses this Mystical Power, the Heavenly Dao that has just experienced the calamity will become extremely weak. It might even welcome the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity. Ancestor, you are also from our Heavenly Dao. Are you really willing to watch as the Heavenly Dao is destroyed?” The other Sages nodded and revealed worried expressions.
 If Sage Fated Secrets used the Dao Destruction Mystical Power, their lineage would be finished.
 Fortunately, Sage Fated Secrets had gone mad and had already forgotten how to use the Dao Destruction Mystical Power. He could only rely on his instincts to wreak havoc everywhere.
 Ancestor Xitian slowly said, “Although you are Sages, don’t underestimate the Heavenly Dao. The Heavenly Dao needs you, but you are not necessary. As for Sage Fated Secrets, everything is karma. I won’t interfere, even if he uses the Dao Destruction Mystical Power.
 “As for the karma between me and the Heavenly Dao, it has long been repaid. In the long years, have you forgotten how many Dao lessons I have given you?”
 Hearing this, the Sages’ expressions turned ugly and they were speechless.
 Ancestor Xitian said meaningfully, “You always want to escape the control of the Dao Ancestor, but when you encounter trouble, you always look forward to the help of stronger people. Do you know that the Dao Ancestor completely relied on himself in the
 past?”
 The Sages were ashamed and did not dare to ask for more.
 After a long while…
 The Sages left the Great Ultimate Hall and came to another palace. This was Li Muyi’s Dao Field.
 Sect Master Tian Jue asked, “Since Ancestor is unwilling to help, we have to rely on ourselves.”
 Fuxitian frowned. “Compared to Sage Fated Secrets, we have to find out who the Dark Forbidden Lord is first. Otherwise, if we don’t get rid of him, a second Sage will go mad.”
 The Sages frowned.
 Emperor Xiao said, “I was beside him when Sage Fated Secrets was cursed. I can confirm that he’s definitely not the Dark Forbidden Lord.”
 He scanned the other Sages.
 The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate mocked him. “In that case, aren’t you the most suspicious?”
 Emperor Xiao frowned. The two Sages began to oppose each other.
 Li Muyi frowned when he saw this.
 He was frustrated. Seeing that the Sages were arguing over their own desires, he wanted to stand up and leave.
 He gave up on the providence of the Heavenly Dao and created the Little Heavenly Dao himself because of that.
 For a time, the Sages began to guess at each other.
 Qiu Xilai was the greatest suspect. Once Sage Fated Secrets went mad, only he could freely control the Dao Destruction Mystical Power.
 This infuriated Qiu Xilai. He had been cursed by the Dark Forbidden Lord, too!
 Time passed.
 It had been fifty years since Ancient Fiendish Yin died.
 Han Jue had nothing to do and checked his emails.
 [Your good friend Heavenly Emperor was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure.]
 (Your good friend Ji Xianshen has obtained a Pseudo-Sage Divine Arm. His cultivation has increased greatly.]
 (Your grand-disciple Fang Liang’s soul has transcended into the primordial era.]
 (Your disciple Zhou Fan was attacked by the Ancient Race) x180223
 (Your good friend Li Daokong was attacked by your good friend Jiang Dugu.]
 (Your good friend Jiang Dugu was attacked by your good friend Li Daokong and was severely injured.]
 (Your good friend Pan Xin broke through the seal and returned to the Immortal World.]
 [Your good friend Empress Houtu has re-created the Magus Race.]
 [Your good friend Nüwa discussed the Dao with a mysterious mighty figure. Her cultivation has increased greatly.]
 crea
 The emails became lively again.
 Han Jue was no longer surprised to see Fang Liang’s soul transmigrating into the primordial era. It was fine as long as it didn’t affect him.
 What really attracted his attention was that Empress Houtu re-created the Magi.
 Her ambition was endless!
 It seemed that the matter of the Nether Race had stimulated her. Like the restart of the Heavenly Dao, she felt that she had hope again.
 Han Jue had no objections to this. This was also good. At least, Empress Houtu would no longer care about the Nether Race. After thinking about it, he called the Nether Race’s leader Han You over.
 Han You knelt in front of him.
 Han Jue first asked about the recent situation of the Nether Race. After Han You relaxed, he asked, “Do you still remember Empress Houtu who created the Nether Race?”
 Han You was stunned. “I remember, but my memories are already blurry.”
 Not long after Empress Houtu created the Nether Race, she handed them to Han Jue. As time passed, Han You really couldn’t remember her.
 “What would you think if I send the Nether Race back to Empress Houtu’s side?” Han Jue asked calmly. Han You turned pale with fright. “Sect Master, what did we do wrong?”.
 He didn’t want to leave the Hundred Peak Immortal River!
 To be precise, he didn’t want to leave Han Jue’s side.
 He had long treated the Dao Field as his home. He wasn’t the only one. All the Nether Race members also thought the same.
 Han Jue smiled. “I’m just asking. I naturally want you to stay.”
 Han You understood. “On behalf of the Nether Race, I promise to serve you forever. We have no ulterior motives.”
 Han Jue nodded in satisfaction. Han You’s favorability had already reached six stars, but it could only be recognized as not enemies.
 The two of them chatted for a while more.
 After Han You left, Han Jue called Han Zuitian over.
 Ever since he transformed, this was the first time Han Zuitian faced Han Jue alone. He was extremely nervous.
 Han Jue asked, “How are the Connate lifeforms in the Hundred Peak Immortal River? Do you need more?”
 After Zu Tu’s palm was destroyed, Connate lifeforms began to gather near the Hundred Peak Immortal River again.
 Han Zuitian said in surprise, “Of course, the more the better. The more low-level living beings there are, the more you can cultivate in peace. The chores and trivial matters in the Hidden Sect can be handed over to the Connate lifeforms. If the Hidden Sect appears in the future, these living beings can also help the sect elders.”
 Han Jue said, “Yes, I’ll move in some Connate lifeforms. Don’t always busy yourself roping in Connate lifeforms. Your cultivation has to keep up. Don’t be surpassed by them.”
 Han Zuitian hurriedly promised that he wouldn’t delay his cultivation.
 After he left, Han Jue started to think.
 Since he wanted to take in these living beings, he had to arrange their identities in the sect.
 Hidden Soldier?
 In-name disciple?
