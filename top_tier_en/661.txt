 “The Calamity Race also needs to recuperate. We can’t fight for long.” “Really?”
 “If you don’t believe me, you can send Chan School disciples to help.” The Heavenly Lord of Primordial Beginning did not answer.
 The Heavenly Calamity Emperor mocked in her heart. Did he really think she was a stupid spear that he could use as he pleased? They fell silent. After a long time. The Heavenly Lord of Primordial Beginning seemed to see through the Heavenly Calamity Emperor. With that, he vanished. “This attack on the Heavenly Dao is an opportunity we gave the Calamity Race. If you don’t cherish it, we can also find other races. Your Calamity Race is strong in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End, but in the Chaos, you can’t compare to the race created by the Chaotic Fiendcelestials. “I will always keep an eye on you.” The Heavenly Calamity Emperor did not care about the Heavenly Lord of Primordial Beginning’s threat at all.
 She only had Han Jue in her heart now and was absolutely obedient to him. She wouldn’t hesitate even if Han Jue asked her to directly fight the Great Dao Sage. The Heavenly Calamity Emperor approached her mat and sat down. She began to cultivate, waiting for Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du’s reply.
 At the same time.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du gathered all the Sages. Han Jue also went. He had to speak up for the Heavenly Calamity Emperor in case the Sages did not believe him. In the Universal Hall, Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du repeated Heavenly Calamity Emperor’s words. “The Calamity Race wants to enter the netherworld? And they want half of it?” The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate frowned with a furious expression.
 The other Sages were also puzzled.
 Han Jue said, “The Calamity Race might not want to be controlled by the Great Dao Sage, so they haven’t attacked the world of the living. We can agree. After all, the netherworld is already controlled by the Calamity Race. From the battle situation, the Calamity Race is retreating.” Qiu Xilai immediately said, “In that case, you can agree and see how it goes.” Heavenly Venerate Wufa said, “Fellow Daoist Han makes sense.”
 Sect Master Tian Jue said, “I agree.” Li Daokong said, “Sect Master is right.” Shi Dudao scanned them thoughtfully. Emperor Xiao narrowed his eyes and fell into deep thought. Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du glanced at Han Jue meaningfully. Han Jue was indifferent and wasn’t afraid of being suspected. In any case, the current Heavenly Dao was under his control. If Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du was a smart person, he wouldn’t expose him. “In that case, I’ll agree to her request first and see how the Calamity Race performs later.” Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du pondered. The Sages had no objections. The conversation ended.
 Han Jue was about to leave when Fang Liang sent him a voice transmission, “Grandmaster, can you come to my Heavenly Dao Palace for a talk?” Han Jue immediately entered the Heavenly Dao Palace and saw Fang Liang.
 The restrictions in the Heavenly Dao Palace were useless to him.
 Fang Liang’s heart palpitated. How strong was Grandmaster now?
 Everyone knew that Han Jue was a Freedom Sage, but all the Sages knew that his speed of becoming stronger was extremely exaggerated. After so many years, he must be even stronger.
 Han Jue stared at Fang Liang and waited for him to speak. Fang Liang asked, “It’s rare for you to take the initiative to speak. Could it be that the reason why Heavenly Calamity Emperor retreated is related to
 you?”
 Han Jue asked, “Is it very important?” Fang Liang said, “Of course. Once the Calamity Race is stationed in the Heavenly Dao, they will integrate sooner or later. The Heavenly Calamity Emperor can even use the providence of the Heavenly Dao of the Calamity Race to become a Heavenly Dao Sage.” Han Jue didn’t reply. Fang Liang said, “Grandmaster, I’ve already found the Jade Slip of Creation with the help of the other Sages. I’m preparing to fuse with the Dao and fuse with the Heavenly Dao Spirit at the same time to prevent anything from happening.” Han Jue asked, “What benefits are there to the Heavenly Dao after Dao Integration?” “Unlike the Dao Ancestor’s Dao Integration, I’ve decided to imitate Pangu and transform into the Heavenly Dao. I’ll expand the Heavenly Dao Domain and help the Heavenly Dao become stronger,” Fang Liang said seriously. Han Jue frowned. “The Dao Ancestor asked you to do this?”
 “No, it’s my own decision.” “How do you know that what you’re thinking wasn’t given to you by the Dao Ancestor? You’ve already transformed into the Dao Ancestor and are about to fuse into the Heavenly Dao. No matter how I look at it, you’re not benefiting. You’re completely paving the way for the Dao Ancestor.” Han Jue couldn’t help but try to persuade him. Fang Liang’s path was becoming more and more crooked.
 Although Fang Liang seemed to have betrayed the Hidden Sect, he had never schemed against Han Jue or targeted the sect. He could only say that he had left the Hidden Sect in name and did not become enemies with it. Under such circumstances, Han Jue still wanted to help him. Fang Liang was silent. Han Jue left after saying, “Think about it carefully. What do you want to pursue? Do you only want to satisfy the Dao Ancestor’s will? Then what are you? Are you still Fang Liang?” Fang Liang frowned. Han Jue’s words touched his soul.
 He suddenly felt like he woke up.
 What was he doing?
 After returning to the Hundred Peak Immortal River, Han Jue immediately used the derivation function.
 “After Fang Liang completes Dao Integration, what will happen to the Heavenly Dao?” [Ten billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 Han Jue entered the illusion.
 When he opened his eyes again, he discovered that he was outside the 33rd Heaven. A dazzling light shone from above, illuminating the entire 33rd Heaven. Han Jue saw the Sages standing in front of the Universal Hall and looking up. He looked up and saw a figure in the center of the dazzling light. Fang Liang!
 Fang Liang was undergoing Dao Integration!
Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m A vast pressure descended. It was an aura that far exceeded the Freedom Sage Realm! Han Jue narrowed his eyes. He saw Fang Liang’s figure changing. Something was wrong. “Greetings, Dao Ancestor!” the Sages suddenly shouted in unison and knelt down with excited expressions. Han Jue showed a frown. “During the time I was gone, the Heavenly Dao was protected by you. You did well. I’m very glad.” An ancient voice sounded. It was no longer Fang Liang’s voice.
 Dao Ancestor!
 The true Dao Ancestor! What happened? Was Fang Liang really a tool? Han Jue frowned even more. He couldn’t deduce everything about the Dao Ancestor. This time, he deduced that the Dao Ancestor was only related to Fang Liang. It seemed that the Dao Ancestor was not completely impossible to deduce. As long as he found an existence with great karma with him, he could deduce the Dao Ancestor, but it was only his fragment in the karma. At this moment, a dazzling light suddenly expanded and enveloped the entire 33rd Heaven. “Dao Ancestor! What do you want?” Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du exclaimed in fear.
 Han Jue turned around and discovered that the Dharmic powers of the Sages were sucked out of their bodies, then the high and mighty Dao Ancestor appeared. “I want the Heavenly Dao to occupy the entire Chaos. I apologize, but from today onwards, the Heavenly Dao will no longer have any Sages.” The Dao Ancestor’s voice was extremely calm without any emotion.
 The illusion ended. Han Jue opened his eyes and frowned. Indeed, Fang Liang was a pawn, a pawn that had been bewitched!
 It seemed that the Dao Ancestor also had a method similar to the Primordial Heavenly Prison! No!
 Han Jue had finally turned the Heavenly Dao into a harmonious situation. It couldn’t be broken by the Dao Ancestor.
 Han Jue might not be safe in the Heavenly Dao when the Dao Ancestor was revived!
