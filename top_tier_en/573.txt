 The Han family seemed to not know Han Tuo’s cultivation level and was still in conflict with the other families in the same city.
 Han Jue retracted his gaze and continued cultivating.
 He did not approve of the Han family, much less help them.
 Although they were related by blood, their feelings were close to strangers.
 Han Jue only wanted to protect Han Tuo. As for the Han family, it depended on whether Han Tuo was willing to protect them.
 Although cultivation was boring, Han Jue didn’t want to find trouble for himself.
 He began to look forward to what Chaotic Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols he could cultivate this time.
 Ten years later.
 Han Jue cultivated fourteen Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols. They were the Strange Fiendcelestial, Ten Thousand Layer Fiendcelestial, Shattering Fiendcelestial, Firmament Fiendcelestial, Taiji Fiendcelestial, Spoken Dharma Fiendcelestial, Silent Fiendcelestial, Dao Resemblance Fiendcelestial, Mental Demon Fiendcelestial, Formless Fiendcelestial, Light Devouring Fiendcelestial, Shocking Fiendcelestial, Rain Devouring Fiendcelestial, and Dao Stability Fiendcelestial.
 He should have continued cultivating, but something happened that interrupted his cultivation. He opened his eyes. In the west of the Immortal World, at the end of the world, boundless black mist attacked from the Dark Forbidden Zone. It was majestic and unstoppable.
 Dozens of mysterious cultivators suddenly appeared and joined forces to attack the black mist. However, their Dharmic powers dissipated completely when they touched the black mist. It was useless.
 “What’s happening?”
 “This mist is strange. Could it be that the Heavenly Devils are attacking again?” “Looks like I have to report it to the Chaotic City.”
 “Third Junior, go to the Chaotic City immediately!”
 “Alright!”
 The disciples guarding the Western World were from the Jie School. The cultivators were at least at the Deity Realm. The leader was even a Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal. However, even joining forces, they could not slow down the black mist at all. They were shocked.
 Han Jue looked at the black mist sweeping towards the Immortal World from afar and frowned.
 There was something wrong with the black mist.
 It was not a Heavenly Devil, but it looked similar.
 Could it be the Dao Devils of the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End?
 Han Jue was very puzzled, but he had no intention of doing anything. Even if the sky collapsed, the other Sages would hold it up. Indeed.
 That day, the South Extreme Heavenly Venerate and Emperor Xiao rushed to the edge of the Immortal World and used their supreme Dharmic powers to successfully resist the black mist’s approach. However, they only resisted and could not disperse it.
 (Qiu Xilai wants to visit you in your dreams. Do you accept?] (Qiu Xilai wants to visit you in your dreams. Do you accept?]
 This fellow began to spam again. It had been a long time since this happened. It was probably related to the black mist outside the Immortal World.
 Han Jue thought for a moment and still chose to accept it. After entering the dream, Qiu Xilai immediately said anxiously, “The Dark Sage King is attacking. You have to help. We Heavenly Dao Sages are not his match!”
 The Dark Sage King?
 Han Jue asked, “Who said that?”
 “Li Muyi! He was attacked by the Dark Sage King. He said that the Dark Sage King might be chasing after him.”
 “Really?”
 Han Jue did not believe it. He had calculated that the Dark Sage King was still far from attacking the Immortal World.
 “Really!”
 “Alright!”
 Han Jue removed the dream and his consciousness returned to reality.
 “I want to know the origins of the black mist attacking the Immortal World.”
 (70 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 A figure appeared in Han Jue’s mind, and a line of words appeared in front of him. [Luo Hou: Perfected Freedom Sage, Ancestor of the Devil Race, Immeasurable Emperor, Son of the Heavenly Dao, Dao Ancestor’s Fiend Body]
 Why was it him?
 Han Jue was so frightened that he immediately sat down and didn’t dare to go and help.
 How could he deal with a Perfected Freedom Sage?
 Wait!
 How could Li Muyi be mistaken?
 Could it be that Luo Hou was closely related to the Dark Sage King?
 Han Jue continued to ask, “Why are Qiu Xilai and Li Muyi saying that the black mist attacking the Immortal World is the Dark Sage King?”
 (4 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?] Continue!
 Han Jue entered the dream and came to Li Muyi’s Dao Field.
 Li Muyi and Qiu Xilai sat opposite each other with solemn expressions.
 Li Muyi asked in a low voice, “Really?”
 “Yes, under the Heavenly Dao Spirit’s lead, I have already found the Dao Ancestor’s Fiend Body. However, Luo Hou has his own will. For the Dao Ancestor’s sake, he’s willing to help us eliminate Han Jue. He only needs to lure him out,” Qiu Xilai said in a low voice.
 Li Muyi’s eyes flickered. Qiu Xilai said, “Compared to me, Han Jue is a greater threat. He alone is enough to overturn us Sages. After I fuse with the Heavenly Dao, I will transcend sooner or later. You and I will enter the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End together. No matter what, we are still fellow disciples from the Dao Sect. What is Han Jue? A Chaotic Fiendcelestial?”
 Li Muyi asked, “Then, how can we trick him to go out?”
 “I can tell now. Unless he has no choice, Han Jue will never leave the Immortal World. We will create another Heavenly Devil Calamity and lure him out. In order to increase the credibility, say that it’s your enemy, the Dark Sage King. No matter how strong the Dark Sage King is, he didn’t kill you. Han Jue should be able to judge.”
 Qiu Xilai said seriously and smiled.
 Li Muyi sighed. “You really see through him.”
 Qiu Xilai smiled. “As long as he goes out, he will definitely die.”
 The dream shattered.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and almost cursed.
 They actually plotted against me!
 However, it had to be said that this trap was indeed very strong and invulnerable.
 If Han Jue didn’t have the derivation function, he might have asked Qiu Xilai first. After confirming it, he might really attack the black mist to protect the Immortal World. What a pity!
 You Sages will never be able to outwit me!
 Han Jue’s eyes turned ruthless.
 Great.
 Since you want to target me, don’t blame me for being impolite!
 Han Jue directly sent a dream to Li Muyi.
 In the dream, Li Muyi saw Han Jue appear and couldn’t help but stand up.
 “Is it really the Dark Sage King?” Han Jue asked.
 Li Muyi smiled bitterly. “That’s right. He’s very strong. I’m afraid only you can deal with him in the entire Immortal World.”
 “What about Heavenly Venerate Wufa?”
 “Heavenly Venerate Wufa is not your match, anyway.”
 “That’s true.”
 Han Jue remained silent.
Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates Li Muyi stared at him.
 Han Jue asked again, “Are you sure it’s the Dark Sage King? Can I deal with him?”. Li Muyi hesitated. “The Dark Sage King should be similar to the previous Dao Heavenly Devil. I can’t be sure that you can kill him, but only you have the strength.”
 This fellow was actually pushing him by saying this!
 Han Jue almost died of anger.
 As expected of a Sage, he acted really well.
 “I’ll consider it.”
 With that, Han Jue left the dream.
 Without another word, he continued cultivating the Grand Unity Aspect. He had to become stronger before dealing with these two dogs.
 Outside the Immortal World.
 The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate and Emperor Xiao were still resisting the black mist.
 The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate asked in a low voice, “Why aren’t the other Sages here
 yet?”
 Emperor Xiao frowned. “I’m not sure. Qiu Xilai went to find Han Jue for help.”
 At the mention of Han Jue, the anxious expression on the South Extreme Heavenly Venerate’s face softened.
 After experiencing the Heavenly Devil Calamity, Han Jue was the strongest in the South Extreme Heavenly Venerate’s heart.
 If Han Jue took action, this calamity should be resolved.
 At the same time, Qiu Xilai and Li Muyi were also waiting
 Time passed.
 Several days later.
 Han Jue had yet to appear.
 Qiu Xilai and Li Muyi panicked.
 Was Han Jue this cowardly?
