 Several times later, the floating island had already turned into dust. The dark space was filled with Han Jue’s vast and scorching Dharmic powers. The Sages were dumbfounded. Even Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du widened his eyes.
 The Dark Sage King was dead?
 Impossible!
 Furthermore, he was forcefully killed and had no ability to resist!
 Han Jue used the simulation trial to check his surroundings. After confirming that the Dark Sage King was not around, he checked his interpersonal relationships and couldn’t find the Dark Sage King’s portrait. He heaved a sigh of relief.
 He turned to look at the Sages and said, “It’s time to save the Heavenly Dao lifeforms!”
 The Sages came back to their senses and used their Mystical Powers to capture the location of the Dark Falling Prison.
 When the Dark Sage King perished, the projection in the Dark Falling Prison vanished. The prisoners were stunned. They didn’t see clearly and didn’t know what had happened.
 Han Tuo and Yi Tian looked at each other in confusion.
 Mortals couldn’t even see the battle of the Sages clearly. At this moment, black pillars of light descended from the sky and landed on every prisoner in the Dark Falling Prison. Han Tuo was wrapped by the black pillar of light and could not move. The dark power in his body began to boil, seeping into his bloodline and soaking into his soul. “What’s happening?” Han Tuo was shocked and extremely terrified.
𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com Facing this power, he felt that his body no longer belonged to him.
 Yi Tian was also terrified. They could clearly sense that they were transforming. They didn’t know if it was good or bad.
 Boom
 The Dark Falling Prison began to shatter. The bottom shattered and all the prisoners fell into the endless darkness.
 On the other side.
 South Extreme Heavenly Venerate suddenly grabbed the Evil Heavenly Emperor and smiled disdainfully. “I didn’t expect you to actually seek refuge with the Dark Sage King. You’re courting death!”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor was extremely angry. He glared at South Extreme Heavenly Venerate and did not explain. “Let him live.”
 A voice floated over, causing the Evil Heavenly Emperor to widen his eyes.
 This voice was Han Jue’s!
 He turned around and saw the mysterious Sage shining with divine light staring at them.
 Their eyes met. The Evil Heavenly Emperor couldn’t see Han Jue’s expression and felt extremely complicated. The small tree he had once protected was already huge. It was even rooted on the Sage camp that he hated. He was flustered.
 The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate frowned and was about to speak when Han Jue said, “Give me face.”
 Hearing this, the South Extreme Heavenly Venerate’s expression changed, and he instantly smiled.
 “Alright, since Fellow Daoist Han has spoken, how can I not give you face?”
 He released his hand and turned to leave, joining the other Sages in finding the Dark Falling Prison.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor looked at Han Jue from afar in silence.
 Han Jue said, “I can protect you. Are you willing to join me?”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor shook his head. “There’s no need. I’ve already become mortal enemies with the Heavenly Dao. In the future, when the darkness and the Heavenly Dao fight, I’ll also let you live.”
 With that, the Evil Heavenly Emperor turned around and left.
 Han Jue showed a frown.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor’s words made him instinctively develop killing intent.
 He still had to rely on the Heavenly Dao to block powerful enemies, so he naturally did not want the Evil Heavenly Emperor to be enemies with the Heavenly Dao.
 However, he suppressed this killing intent. He couldn’t attack the Heavenly Emperor.
 He turned around. The two of them were like father and son in the past.
 Not long ago, the Heavenly Emperor also protected Han Jue so forcefully and followed all his requests.
 Han Jue didn’t mistreat the Heavenly Emperor. If not for his interference in fate many times, the Heavenly Emperor would have died in the calamity. When Han Jue turned around, he understood something So what if he was a Sage?
 This was fate!
 Han Jue could capture the Evil Heavenly Emperor into the Primordial Heavenly Prison, but what was the point?
 At most, the Evil Heavenly Emperor would obey him completely. It couldn’t erase his hatred towards the Heavenly Dao.
 Han Jue sighed in his heart and stopped thinking about it. He immediately sent a dream to Immortal Emperor Samsara and asked him to use the Invocation Technique so that he could escape at any time.
 The dream ended quickly after Han Jue said this. Immortal Emperor Samsara didn’t even have time to ask.
 For the next period of time, Immortal Emperor Samsara followed Han Jue’s instructions and kept using the Invocation Technique.
 A black vortex appeared behind Han Jue and followed behind him.
 The Sages were surprised when they saw it.
 They didn’t dare to ask or even check with their Sage Sense, afraid of offending him.
 The scene of Han Jue forcefully killing the Dark Sage King was still vivid in their minds. The remaining power was still there, and they were also very afraid.
 Since Han Jue could kill the Dark Sage King, killing them was naturally nothing difficult.
 They weren’t as powerful as the Dark Sage King
 …
 In the darkness.
 Han Tuo’s consciousness slowly woke up. He felt that he was constantly falling, as if he was falling into an abyss.
 “What’s going on…
 “Am I going to die?” Han Tuo thought numbly.
 “I can save you as long as you’re willing to let me occupy your body!”
 The mysterious white-robed man’s voice sounded again.
 “If this continues, you will be devoured by the Dark Sage King’s dark power. You will become the Inauspicious Evil of the Dark Forbidden Zone!
 “This is the only way!”
 Hearing the other party’s urging, Han Tuo still did not answer.
 He was reviewing his life.
 He had experienced excitement, regret, pain, and satisfaction.
 Perhaps he should end it this way.
 His only regret was that he had yet to revive his parents and wife.
 After a hundred thousand years, it was already wishful thinking for Han Tuo to find their souls.
 “Perhaps death is the true release.”  Han Tuo thought bitterly.
 At this moment, a beam of light pierced through the darkness and shone on him.
 The light entered Han Tuo’s eyes and awakened the hope in his heart.
 He saw a hand reaching for him.
 “That is…”
 Han Tuo’s pupils slowly widened in disbelief.
 A figure appeared behind that hand, a figure that was already blurry in his memories.
 Father!
 The blurred face in the depths of his memories became clear.
 Han Tuo was extremely excited. He wanted to speak, but he could not. Han Jue put him into his sleeve expressionlessly. The Dark Falling Prison collapsed, causing a strong spatial fluctuation. The Sages had sensed the spatial fluctuation and found the Dark Falling Prison.
 After saving the Heavenly Dao lifeforms, the Sages gathered. Han Jue quietly stepped into the dark vortex of the Invocation Technique and disappeared.
 “Where’s Fellow Daoist Han?” The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate asked in surprise.
 Qiu Xilai said, “Fellow Daoist Han has already left. Let’s also leave so that the existence behind the Dark Sage King won’t find trouble with us!”
 “Alright!”
 The Sages immediately fled.
 Before Han Jue left, he sent a voice transmission to Qiu Xilai and Heavenly Venerate Wufa, telling them to escape quickly.
 The Sages quickly traveled through space. They were no less nervous than Han Jue and were also worried that they would be killed by the mysterious mighty figure.
 As he traveled, Fuxitian sighed. “I didn’t expect Fellow Daoist Han to be so powerful. He’s probably already achieved the Freedom Realm.”
 The Sages’ expressions became complicated.
 They watched as Han Jue became stronger step by step, surpassing them and leaving them behind.
 This shock was indescribable.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “It must be the Freedom Sage Realm. It seems that Fellow Daoist Han has a powerful background that we can’t see through.”
 He didn’t believe that Han Jue cultivated to this stage by himself.
 This fellow was definitely a mighty figure!
