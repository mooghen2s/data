 He had already lost 500 trillion years of his lifespan!
 (Because of your curse, your enemy Cundi’s Dao heart was damaged.]
 Han Jue hesitated. Should he just kill this fellow?
 Kill!
 Wasn’t six stars of Hatred Points a clear sign! Han Jue gritted his teeth, and his eyes turned sinister. The Book of Misfortune emitted a black light that shone on his face. He looked so terrifying and evil.
 Han Jue’s lifespan decreased rapidly! 1 quadrillion years!
 [Because of your curse, your enemy Cundi developed mental demons.)
 2 quadrillion years!
 [Because of your curse, your enemy Cundi’s Dao heart shattered and his cultivation fell greatly.]
 3 quadrillion years!

 (Your enemy Cundi was sealed by your enemy Jie Yin and his cultivation turned into nothingness.)
 The moment the last email appeared, Han Jue’s curse missed. It made him feel as if he had suddenly stepped on air. Han Jue put away the Book of Misfortune and asked in his mind, “How long will it take for Cundi to recover his cultivation?”
 [Ten billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 His value had decreased so quickly? Han Jue was in a good mood.
 [It’s immeasurable. At least, it takes longer than the time it took him to cultivate to his current realm.]
 He was crippled!
 Han Jue smiled. Although he didn’t curse him to death, he had at least killed a potential enemy. Six stars of hatred was too blinding. Han Jue’s interpersonal relationships were ranked according to Hatred Points.
 He had to stay vigilant. Enemies were more important than good friends! After all, his enemy might take his life. Han Jue rested for a few hours and quickly entered his cultivation state. He wanted to break through as soon as possible.
 Outside the 33rd Heaven, Universal Hall. The Sages gathered. Other than Han Jue, even Empress Houtu was among them.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du had a strange expression as he said, “I just learned something.” He looked at Qiu Xilai. Qiu Xilai was expressionless and surprised. Could it be related to him?
 The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate asked, “Is it good or bad?”
 The other Sages were also nervous. Ever since they had broken up with the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End, they had been guarding against sudden attacks. Fortunately, it had always been very peaceful.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du took a deep breath and said, “The Ancestor of the Buddhist Sect, Cundi Sacred, was cursed by the Dark Forbidden Lord and died.”
 The Sages widened their eyes. The Buddhist Sect had always been a major force in the Immortal World. Its legends were even widespread.
 Who was Cundi?
 He was the Dao Ancestor’s disciple!
 The Sages also knew that an ancient mighty figure like Cundi was very likely already comparable to the Great Dao. Such a powerful mighty figure died just like that?
 Qiu Xilai was moved and secretly shocked. Ever since he had been subdued by Han Jue, he had lost his karma with Cundi. For this, Cundi had even cursed him in his dreams, without the bearing of a senior. Qiu Xilai really didn’t expect him to die.
 Shi Dudao was the happiest among them, but he didn’t show it.
 It was the Dark Forbidden Lord again! How strong was he? Li Daokong asked, “What’s the Dark Forbidden Lord’s attitude towards our Heavenly Dao? Why does he want to curse Cundi to death?”.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “I’m not sure about the Dark Forbidden Lord’s goal, but there’s one thing that shouldn’t be wrong. The Dark Forbidden Lord supports the Heavenly Dao. My master told me that Jie Yin found him and begged for mercy on Cundi’s behalf. Jie Yin thought that my master was the Dark Forbidden Lord. During this period of time, Cundi had been pretending to be the Dark Forbidden Lord to curse me. I just didn’t say it.” Heavenly Venerate Wufa snorted. “I was also cursed. So it was done by Cundi. That Dark Forbidden Lord might not necessarily support the Heavenly Dao. He just can’t stand Cundi’s impersonation.”
 “It’s also possible. No matter what, the Dark Forbidden Lord isn’t targeting us, right?”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du nodded with a smile.
 Back then, when he chose to support the Heavenly Dao, he had been under immense pressure. He didn’t expect things to go smoothly. He only needed to manage the Heavenly Dao well. The powerful enemies were all blocked by other mighty figures. “What does your master think of the Heavenly Dao?” Fang Liang suddenly asked.
 The Sages couldn’t help but look at Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du. Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du had indeed mentioned his master just now. Didn’t he say that they had already broken up?
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “My master, Laozi, has been cultivating in seclusion. He’s not in charge of the current Human School. My master cultivates the Grand Supreme Heartless Dao and does not support the Heavenly Dao, but he will also not support the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End. However, the fact that he can tell me this is also a good signal. If I can rope my master into the Heavenly Dao camp, the Heavenly Dao will be safe.
 “My master is the number one person below the Dao Ancestor. As long as he gives the order, the mighty figures of the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End will not dare to act recklessly.”
 Speaking of him, Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du’s tone was filled with respect. The Sages did not say anything. They wouldn’t question Laozi’s strength. However, it might not be a good thing if he descended into the Heavenly
 Dao.
 At that time, wouldn’t the Heavenly Dao be the Heavenly Dao of the Human School? The reason why they were united now was because they had a common enemy. If Laozi joined, there would be no powerful enemy.
 Shi Dudao caught the gazes of the Sages and smiled mockingly. He suddenly felt Li Daokong staring at him and immediately retracted his smile.
 “Hmph, this brat…”
 Shi Dudao was furious when he saw Li Daokong. This fellow came to fight with him whenever he had the time. It was really annoying. Emperor Xiao said, “The Ancient Desolate’s seal is about to break. I can already sense the aura of the Primordial Devil Race.”
 Primordial Devil Ancestor!
 He was suppressed by the Dao Ancestor in the Ancient Desolate and was the first batch of prisoners.
 Empress Houtu said, “Reincarnation can also sense the Ancient Desolate’s aura… Also…”
 She hesitated for a moment before continuing, “Are my brothers also sealed in the Ancient Desolate? I sensed their call earlier.”
 The Sages were moved. The Ancestral Magi had not completely perished? “Impossible. I saw the deaths of the Ancestral Magi with my own eyes. They don’t have souls.” Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du shook his head.
 He suddenly thought of something and his expression changed. The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate asked, “What’s wrong? What did you think?”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du frowned. “Could the mighty figures who died in the past be sucked away by some great Mystical Power and suppressed in the Ancient Desolate?
 Currently, we only know that the Heavenly Sect Master and the Primordial Devil Race are suppressed in the Ancient Desolate, but in fact, the Ancient Desolate is very big.
 It’s even wider than the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End. Such a huge territory should have many mighty figures imprisoned within. The methods of the previous Dao Ancestor are unimaginable. He hid the truth of the Primordial Purple Qi from us. Could he also be hiding the secrets of the Ancient Desolate?” The Sages also frowned.
 Heavenly Venerate Wufa said, “In that case, could the Dark Forbidden Lord be the Dao Ancestor? Or someone under the Dao Ancestor?”
 The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate asked, “If he’s the Dao Ancestor, why did he design to release the cage he created?” It didn’t make sense! The Sages looked at Fang Liang. The Dao Ancestor’s avatar was here! Fang Liang’s expression darkened. It was unknown what he was thinking. Seeing his expression, the Sages’ hearts skipped a beat. Empress Houtu suddenly said, “I previously received a dream from Father when I was cultivating.”
 Her words shocked the Sages. Empress Houtu was an Ancestral Magus in the past!
 Who was the Ancestral Magus’ Father? The world creator, Giant God Pangu!
