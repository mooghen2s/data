 Was the Inauspicious Deity stronger than a quasi-sage?
 Secretly shocked, Han Jue immediately brought the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus out.
 The disciples of the Hidden Sect flew into the sky and prepared to participate. Ma Chao also joined the battle and joined forces with Lü Bu to fight against the Inauspicious Deity. They were equivalent to two Zu Tu, but they were still not the latter’s match.
 “What is that?”
 “So fast!”
 “Something’s wrong. This fellow isn’t a living being. What a terrifying grudge. Everyone, stabilize your Dao hearts!”
 “What’s going on? I can’t see it, but I hear the sound of mental demons in my heart.”
 “Master is here!”
 Everyone from the Hidden Sect panicked. When the Inauspicious Deity entered, a few people felt their mental demons manifest, including Jiang Yi.
 People who easily developed mental demons all had some sort of lingering indignation in their hearts.
 If one’s Dao heart was unstable, it was naturally easy for them to develop mental demons.
 Han Jue flew to the edge of Hidden Sect Island on the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus. The Strange Deity followed on his shoulder.
 Looking at the Inauspicious Deity, Han Jue was filled with vigilance. If not for him being worried that something would happen to the others, he could have used the simulation trial to test it.
 Although the Inauspicious Deity was strong, it couldn’t directly kill Lü Bu and Ma Chao. However, Han Jue could. This meant that he was stronger than the Inauspicious Deity.
 After all, the current Han Jue could already compete with a Pseudo-Sage. Without another word, Han Jue directly used the Grand Unity Aspect and condensed five Chaotic Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols. Five terrifying figures stood in the sky above Hidden Sect Island.
 The disciples’ eyes widened.
CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m What was that?
 Zhao Xuanyuan and Dao Sovereign subconsciously trembled. They couldn’t forget the memories of being ravaged by the Chaotic Fiendcelestials.
 The Inauspicious Deity was like a figure without a true form. It turned its head and rushed towards Han Jue.
 Lü Bu and Ma Chao relaxed.
 The Wind Shaking Fiendcelestial suddenly threw a punch, causing the wind to howl and the Inauspicious Deity’s speed to decrease. The distant sea was crushed until it stirred up endless waves, like a sea wall blocking the horizon.
 The Void Fiendcelestial attacked as well. Two black beams shot out from its eyes, enveloping the Inauspicious Deity.
 The Inauspicious Deity roared. Although it was silent, its attitude was extremely sinister. Even Han Jue felt uncomfortable looking at it.
 Facing the power of the Void Fiendcelestial’s Great Dao, the Inauspicious Deity began to turn into nothingness.
 At this moment!
 The Strange Deity on Han Jue’s shoulder immediately rushed out and arrived in front of the Inauspicious Deity. It opened its bloody mouth and swallowed the Inauspicious Deity.
 The others couldn’t see the Strange Deity. In their vision, the Inauspicious Deity seemed to have vanished into thin air. They couldn’t help but become nervous.
 Just like that, the Inauspicious Deity was destroyed.
 Calm returned to Hidden Sect Island.
 Han Jue finally understood. Although the Inauspicious Deity was strong, it was still weak when facing the power of the Great Dao.
 Most importantly, the Inauspicious Deity had no sense of reason and only relied on instincts to fight.
 Han Jue looked up at the sky. The array formation of the Dao Field began to recover.
 The Strange Deity returned to Han Jue. It was very happy. Swallowing the Inauspicious Deity was probably very helpful to it. Han Jue returned to the cave abode after saying this:
 “The danger has been resolved. All of you can continue cultivating.”
 Everyone from the Hidden Sect and the ten thousand Nether Race members had yet to recover from their shock.
 It was settled just like that?
 Jiang Yi couldn’t help but ask, “What Mystical Power was that just now? Dharma Idol Mystical Power?”
 Dao Sovereign took a deep breath and said, “That’s right, we were…”
 Before he could finish, Jiang Yi shivered.
 If he faced the Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols…
 No way!
 After this battle, everyone from the Hidden Sect believed that the mighty figures in the simulation trial were all defeated by Han Jue!
 In the Connate Cave Abode, Han Jue was observing the Strange Deity.
 His divine sense could not penetrate the Strange Deity, so he did not know its exact situation.
 He had no choice but to use the derivation function to probe.
 “After devouring the Inauspicious Deity, what will happen to the Strange Deity?”
 (2 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?)
 Continue!
 (The Strange Deity can become stronger by devouring more Inauspicious Deities. To be precise, the Strange Deity can devour all non-living beings to become stronger.]
 All non-living beings!
 Han Jue raised his eyebrows in surprise.
 He had found a treasure!
 Not only did the Strange Deity restrain the Inauspicious Deity, but it also suppressed other unknown existences!
 Of course, r ead on w w si te, the prerequisite was that Han Jue could help the Strange Deity suppress those peculiar existences. If the Strange Deity couldn’t defeat the enemy, it definitely couldn’t devour it.
 Han Jue’s thoughts returned. He began to control Hidden Sect Island to move, afraid that other Inauspicious Deities would appear.
 He suddenly felt uneasy.
 The Dark Forbidden Zone was no longer safe!
 “I want to know, how many Inauspicious Deities are there in the Dark Forbidden Zone?”
 Han Jue asked in his mind. He was beginning to squander his lifespan, but he had yet to hit a round number.
 Yes, this was considered daily expenses.
 [Ten billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 So much?
 He had to!
 Han Jue gritted his teeth and chose to continue.
 [The Inauspicious Deities are constantly being born. Their numbers are steadily increasing. They are related to the Great Dao Sages.]
 Eh?
 Great Dao Sages!
 Han Jue felt that he had triggered another major side storyline.
 However, he did not continue calculating.
 It was useless even if he knew. He couldn’t come into contact with the Great Dao Sages at all.
 One thing was clear.
 The Dark Forbidden Zone would become more and more dangerous in the future.
 He wondered when the Dao Field would be upgraded.
 He would probably have to wait for the next major event or for him to break through to the Pseudo-Sage Realm.
 Han Jue was calm. After flying for another few months on Hidden Sect Island, he stopped and focused on cultivating
 After being attacked by the Inauspicious Deity, another sixty years passed.
 The Hidden Sect was very calm. In the past sixty years, Hidden Sect Island was no longer attacked by Inauspicious Deities. Han Jue was also not visited in a dream.
 Han Jue focused on cultivating. He was still far from the perfected Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm.
 However, he was confident that he could break through in a thousand years.
 Sigh.
 His breakthrough speed was really slow.
 Han Jue had no choice but to check his interpersonal relationships and compare them with his other friends to obtain psychological comfort.
 (Nüwa sent you a dream. Do you accept it?]
 Han Jue ignored her.
 He had already met Qiu Xilai. If he met another Sage, he would easily fall into a dilemma.
 Besides, he would definitely be forced to enter the calamity at this juncture.
 [Detected that a new Heavenly Dao Race has appeared. You have the following choices:)
 [1: Come out immediately and slaughter this race. Help the Human Race stabilize the status of the Heavenly Dao Race. You can obtain a Mystical Power, a Great Dao Fragment, and a system upgrade.)
 [2: Cultivate in a low profile manner and never enter the Immortal World before the calamity ends. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment and a Supreme Treasure.]
 Han Jue chose the second option without hesitation.
 Wasn’t it courting death to slaughter that race now!
 (You chose to cultivate in a low profile manner and obtained a Great Dao Fragment and a Supreme Treasure.]
 [Congratulations on obtaining the Heavenly Dao Supreme Treasure-Sun and Moon Yin-Yang Protection]
 (Sun and Moon Yin-Yang Protection: Heavenly Dao Supreme Treasure, a defensive Supreme Treasure. It can block all attacks below the Sages and can absorb the essence of the sun and moon to convert into Dharmic powers.)
 What a treasure!
 Defensive Supreme Treasure!
 Great!
 Not only that, Han Jue had already accumulated eight Great Dao Fragments!
