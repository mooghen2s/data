 “He’s already dead.” Han Jue smiled. Chu Xiaoqi looked up at him in surprise.
 “Grandpa, you killed him?”
 “No, it was you. He was already dead when I arrived. He should have suffered from Qi Deviation and forcefully possessed someone. He died by his own hands.”
 “I see. Then I killed him. Hahaha, I set him up to suffer from Qi Deviation.”
 Chu Xiaoqi turned to look at Tang Wan, who was walking over from not far away. He smiled proudly and said, “Wan’er, I was acting earlier to make him let down his guard.”
 Tang Wan nodded. “I believe your crying, but I don’t think you can pee your pants for an act. I can’t do it, anyway.”
 Chu Xiaoqi was embarrassed and did not know how to refute.
 Tang Wan took the initiative to bow to Han Jue. She introduced herself a little nervously.
 Han Jue smiled kindly, but with his appearance, his smile was not kind but gentle. Tang Wan blushed.
 Chu Xiaoqi widened his eyes and shouted, “Damn it, Wan’er, don’t tell me you want to be my grandmother? That won’t do!”
 “What nonsense are you saying!”
 Tang Wan was furious. She naturally didn’t fall in love with Han Jue at first sight. However, he was so handsome and
 unfathomable, so she naturally couldn’t face him casually.
 Han Jue said angrily, “Don’t go around acknowledging your grandmother. Your grandmother just left not long ago. She might be eavesdropping from somewhere. Be careful she doesn’t deal with you.”
 Hearing this, Chu Xiaoqi hurriedly jumped up and looked around, kowtowing in different directions.
 Tang Wan rolled her eyes. This fellow was very imposing when he was serious, but he was usually very unreasonable. He was simply a freak.
 Han Jue smiled. “Alright, don’t cause trouble. Rest well. There won’t be any danger nearby for the time being.”
 Chu Xiaoqi stood up and nodded excitedly. It felt good to survive.
 For the next period of time, Han Jue sat by the river. Tang Wan and Chu Xiaoqi cultivated not far away and occasionally practiced their spells.
 Tang Wan was very curious about Han Jue.
 She asked how they met when the two of them went out to find herbs. After knowing the process of their encounter, Tang Wan felt that Han Jue must be an expert.
 That green-robed Daoist had definitely died in Han Jue’s hands!
 However, Chu Xiaoqi did not think of this.
 This fellow was really naive.
 In the blink of an eye, more than half a year passed.
 Chu Xiaoqi was worried that the sect would find them and suggested that they change locations. Han Jue had no objections to this. To him, it didn’t matter where he went. He couldn’t be bothered to argue with them.
 Just like that, Han Jue and Chu Xiaoqi embarked on the path of the world again, but
 with one more person this time.
 Chu Xiaoqi and Tang Wan flew on their
 swords, while Han Jue rode a cloud as usual.
 This method surprised Tang Wan.
 Wasn’t that the legendary Immortal? Tang Wan was even more respectful towards
 Han Jue.
 Several months later, the three of them
 arrived at a villa. The nearby mountains were steep and no one could be seen within a
 thousand miles. It was like a paradise. However, there was no one in this villa. Han
 Tang Wan felt that this place was sinister and
 did not dare to walk alone. She kept following Chu Xiaoqi, but he did not care. With his grandfather around, Chu Xiaoqi felt that he wouldn’t be afraid even if the sky
 collapsed.
 Han Jue felt that this place was not bad and agreed to stay.
 It was a good opportunity to increase Chu Xiaoqi’s cultivation.
 As night fell, Tang Wan did not dare to stay alone. She found Chu Xiaoqi, and the two of them stayed in the same room.
 Tang Wan was at the Foundation Establishment realm, after all, but she still felt uneasy entering this place. The two of
 them were not mortals and did not need to sleep. They cultivated together. However, every night, they could hear the
 faint cries of women and children. This made Tang Wan even more nervous, and Chu Xiaoqi could not remain calm.
 He was a Golden Core realm cultivator. How
 strong were ghosts that even he could not
 see?
 He was indeed very strong!
 Han Jue predicted that even if a Nascent Soul
 realm cultivator came to this villa, they would also die. The person who slaughtered this villa was at the Tribulation Transcendence Realm and captured all the adult men here. The
 consequences of his spell were to make the evil ghosts stronger.
 The ghosts here absorbed the essence of the
 sun and moon every day and became stronger
 all the time.
 The reason they didn’t hurt them was naturally because of Han Jue.
 He planned to let Chu Xiaoqi deal with these
 ghosts as an exam after he became stronger. On this day.
 Han Jue was cultivating when a line of words
 appeared in front of him.
 [The Formless Transcendent Deity sent you a dream. Do you accept?]
 With Han Jue’s cultivation, the Dao Creator
 shouldn’t be able to visit him in his dreams, but he still lowered his status and gave the Formless Transcendent Deity the right. The Formless Transcendent Deity was now the overseer of the Endless Era, the most powerful existence on the surface.
 The dream was a blank domain. The Formless Transcendent Deity bowed respectfully and asked, “Creation Lord, are there requirements towards future Dao Creators?”
 Han Jue said, “There’s no need to restrict
 For example, Han Huang, Han Ling, the
 Primordial Ancestor God, the Ultimate God of Punishment, and the other top Great Dao
 “I observed the future and discovered that a
 calamity for Dao Creators might appear in the future. It might be related to the Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil.”
 The Formless Transcendent Deity continued.
 After the Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil was chased out of the Chaos, he actually disappeared mysteriously. Han Jue couldn’t deduce it. He guessed that it was related to
 “Let the Fusang Divine Tree supervise the
 future,” Han Jue replied, deciding the Fusang Tree’s status.
 The Formless Transcendent Deity nodded, not daring to refute.
 He hesitated for a moment and then asked, “Recently, Han Ye has been destroying the Great Dao Worlds everywhere to increase his cultivation. Do I have to do anything about him?” Han Jue said, “Aren’t you unaffected by karma? Let nature take its course. Don’t interfere with things below your level. The Endless Era is a brand-new era. Even I don’t
 know what kind of danger will appear in the future. Let all living beings be vigilant.” “Understood.”
 After the dream ended.
 Han Jue looked at Han Ye. This kid was indeed
 a little bloodthirsty. Furthermore, the direction he traveled would coincidentally bump into this world.
 According to his calculations, Han Ye would
 arrive in this world in at most a hundred million years. His descendants couldn’t be bullied, but he couldn’t let him mess around.
 Han Jue suddenly had an idea and smiled.
 …
 In the blank domain, large worlds were dotted with pale white.
 Han Ye, who was surrounded by blood Qi, meditated in the void. His entire body trembled very frequently and his state was
 extremely wrong.
 At this moment, Han Ye was in a dream. In his dream, a blurry mysterious figure kept
 suppressing him, making him very angry.


 Han Ye woke up from his dream after fighting for a long time.
 This was not the first time he had such a dream. Every time he cultivated and entered a state, he would be tied down by such a nightmare. Most importantly, he could not deduce the karma of this dream.
 Could it be because I’ve killed too many people, causing negative karma and grudges?
 Han Ye frowned, but his Innate Great Creation was the Ultimate Killing Star. He had relied on killing to grow to this day. If he was asked to give up, it was equivalent to cutting off his right arm.
 “I have to resolve this dream. Otherwise, I won’t be able to cultivate in the future and can only kill,” Han Ye muttered to himself. He stood up and continued his plan.
 Since he couldn’t find the problem, he would continue killing!
 One day, he would find the fellow in his dream and kill him to eliminate future trouble!
 Somewhere in the blank domain, thousands of worlds surrounded a huge palace like stars. It was the Creation Emperor Court.
 After the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity ended, the status of the Creation Emperor Court soared. Now, it was already one of the most famous Holy Lands in the Endless Era. The Emperor was even given the responsibility of controlling the order of the Endless Era.
 The current Creation Emperor Court had absorbed many mighty figures, including Dao Sovereign, Zhao Xuanyuan, Jiang Yi, Lao Dan, Li Daokong, and other ancient gods who had left behind legends in the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity.
 From the perspective of a Great Dao Sage, a hundred million years was not long, but to all living beings, existences below the Sage Realm, a hundred million years was already the alternation of several eras.
 Inside the hall.
 Han Yao and Han Bashen faced Han Ling. They were alone.
 Han Ling wore an exquisite and holy robe with countless jades hanging on it. The jades reflected small worlds. The divine light on her head shone with a strong light and covered most of her face. Only her mouth could be seen. Just her mouth was enough to make
 people appear.
 to control Han Ye. If this continues, our Creation Emperor Court’s reputation will be sullied by him!”
 After the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity ended, although Han Ye was still in the Creation Emperor Court, his relationship with the Primordial Chaos was clearly closer. It was mainly the Primordial Chaos with Han
 Huang.
 There were three Primordial Chaos in the Endless Era. They were each on their own side and were very far away. Their relationship was subtle. Han Huang was the most famous. In the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity, his contributions were higher than the Emperor of the Creation Emperor Court.
 Han Ling said, “He has already fallen into his own calamity. Don’t worry. Just watch.” Han Yao asked in surprise, “What calamity is
 it?”
 “Life and Death Calamity.”
 Han Yao frowned. Han Bashen was the same.
 Although they were unhappy with Han Ye, they still had a close relationship. They were also members of the clan. How could they see
 Han Ye die?
 “You don’t have to care about this. I have
 something to tell you,” Han Ling continued, ignoring their turbulent emotions.
 “Formless World has opened the Dao Mystic Realm. I hope that the various factions can enter a mortal world. Every faction can only enter one mortal world. The cultivation level of the mortal world cannot surpass the Deity Realm. Its goal is to unite the Endless Era and for the various factions to establish a certain connection. The choice of this world is chosen by Han Yao. Han Bashen, go to the Dao Mystic Realm and gather information in advance. Contact Han Yao at any time,” she instructed.
 Han Ye and Han Bashen accepted the order and left.
 As the sun shone brightly, the huge villa was
 filled with boundless mist.
 In a courtyard.
 Chu Xiaoqi was cultivating a spell. He was
 cultivating the transformation technique. Tang Wan was feeding a huge golden eagle. It was Chu Xiaoniao.
 Chu Xiaoniao had always been in a free-range
 state and had only found them recently. This made Chu Xiaoqi very happy. He had even forgotten about this fellow. He didn’t expect it to find him.
 Little did he know that Chu Xiaoniao was not
 looking for him, but Han Jue.
 Chu Xiaoniao already had intelligence. Han Jue had once taught it and it had benefited greatly. All these years, it had wandered around and discovered that it was too weak to be a Demon King, so it followed Chu Xiaoqi’s
 aura to cultivate. Of course, Chu Xiaoniao
 didn’t show this.
 At this moment, a figure flew out from the clouds.
 This person had disheveled hair and looked to
 be in his fifties or sixties. He wore a gorgeous
 black robe and had a powerful aura. His gaze landed on Chu Xiaoqi.
 “Kid, I’ve finally found you! So you’re hiding in this ferocious land. You’re courting death.” Chu Xiaoqi and Tang Wan looked up, and
 their expressions changed drastically. “Sect Master…”
 Tang Wan’s expression turned defeated.
 Chu Xiaoqi was on high alert as he shouted,
 “Old man Chen Xu, don’t be arrogant. My grandfather is here. You’re courting death if you dare to attack me!”
 Daoist Chen Xu didn’t capture Han Jue’s aura
 and guessed that Chu Xiaoqi was bluffing. He smiled disdainfully and said, “Could it be that your grandfather is a wandering ghost here?”
 Chu Xiaoqi snorted. “My grandfather is an Immortal. Your illegitimate son has done all sorts of evil and harmed so many fellow disciples. As the Sect Master, you didn’t stop
 him. You deserve to die. Today, I’ll let the Immortal uphold justice!” “Ridiculous!”
 Daoist Chen Xu’s anger was instantly ignited. He had many illegitimate children, but the son Chu Xiaoqi killed was the most talented. He still wanted to send that illegitimate child to a larger sect to exchange for pills that could
 break through a higher realm. Unfortunately, all of this was ruined by this
 brat! Daoist Chen Xu waved his right hand and a
 figure landed in front of Chu Xiaoqi. It was the corpse of a handsome man. Chu Xiaoqi’s eyelids twitched. He suddenly realized that something was
 wrong. The other party was not only here to kill him.
 “Today, you have to die for my son. My son will revive with your death!” Daoist Chen Xu said coldly. He took out a white ruler and
 pressed it down. In an instant, a terrifying pressure descended, causing Chu Xiaoqi and Tang Wan to vomit blood and kneel on the ground. The courtyard collapsed and the fog in all directions dispersed.
 Daoist Chen Xu was about to cast a spell when
 he suddenly saw a figure that made his pupils constrict.
 After the clouds dispersed, he saw a figure sitting on the roof of the Daoist temple next door. He actually did not sense it.
 Now, even when he saw the other party, his
 divine sense did not capture his aura. It was as if this person did not exist and he was only hallucinating.
 “There’s really an immortal?” Daoist Chen Xu had such a ridiculous thought.
 He was about to speak when Han Jue opened his eyes and glanced over with a cold gaze.
 Before Daoist Chen Xu could see his eyes clearly, his body was instantly petrified. He fell and smashed into the courtyard that had turned into ruins. He shattered, causing rubble to scatter all over the ground. Chu Xiaoqi was dumbfounded. Tang Wan was
 also in disbelief.
 What happened? Chu Xiaoniao shivered in fear. Han Jue’s voice floated over, “I wonder when
 you can rely on yourself to resolve all the trouble.”


 “Oh my god! Grandpa! You’re f*cking strong!” Chu Xiaoqi came back to his senses and exclaimed. He immediately jumped to Han Jue’s side and started to flatter him.
 Tang Wan looked at the rubble ahead and swallowed.
 A Soul Formation realm cultivator died just like that?
 How was that possible…
 Even the legendary Mahayana cultivator
 couldn’t kill a Soul Formation realm cultivator
 without attacking, right?
 This method was beyond Tang Wan’s imagination.
 “Grandpa, what Mystical Power was that just now? Teach me!
 11
 ‘Grandpa, you’re definitely at the Mahayana Realm, right?
 “Have you surpassed the Mahayana Realm? Can immortals descend into the mortal world?”
 Chu Xiaoqi shook Han Jue’s arm and kept asking questions.
 Han Jue was helpless. Only this kid dared to be so rude. If it was Han Huang, Han Tuo, and Han Yunjin, he would directly slap them.
 “I can’t tell you my cultivation level for now. You’re not qualified to know. Cultivate well.”
 Han Jue interrupted Chu Xiaoqi and chased him out.
 Tang Wan sighed. “Are you really his grandson? How can an immortal love mortals so much?”
 Chu Xiaoqi scratched his head. “I saw it with my own eyes when my grandfather was buried. It can’t be fake.”
 “Could it be an ancestor?”
 “It’s really possible. After all, we’re both handsome and of the same lineage.”
 “How shameless are you?”
 Tang Wan rolled her eyes. She felt that Han Jue was the most handsome man she had ever seen, and Chu Xiaoqi was the most shameless man she had ever seen. It was all reflected on her face.
 Chu Xiaoqi chuckled. “In any case, he’s my biological grandfather. I’m certain of this!”
 Who could threaten him in the future with such powerful backing?
 Chu Xiaoqi was overjoyed. He had already imagined a beautiful future.
 After Daoist Chen Xu died, no one from the sect came to hunt him down. The cultivation days in the villa became more leisurely.
 time.
 The two of them didn’t know what fortuitous encounter they had encountered, but they clearly felt their improvement. Although that was the case, it was still within their
 acceptable range. After all, this was an immortal.
 Twenty years passed quickly.
 Chu Xiaoqi had reached the Nascent Soul
 realm, and Tang Wan had reached the Golden Core realm. She was not far from the Nascent
 Soul realm.
 Such cultivation speed was definitely top-notch in the mortal world. It was even
 faster than the top prodigies in this mortal world. The two of them did not realize this.
 On this day.
 Tang Wan found Han Jue.
 He already treated her as his granddaughter-in-law and would occasionally chat with her, so the two of them
 were not distant.
 Tang Wan sat beside him and said in distress, “Brother Xiaoqi looks different. Or rather, he has no feelings for me at all.”
 Han Jue smiled. “You two are fated. The reason he didn’t tell you his feelings is that he’s still waiting.”
 “Waiting for what?”
 “Waiting for more women.”
 “Hmph, it’s indeed like his style. Previously,
 he always peeped at the other female disciples in the sect.”
 “Then, you have to capture him well. I can’t
Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎 force the two of you to be together. Although there’s marriage, it’s difficult to decide.
 “Even you can’t predict it?”
 “I can, but I can’t reveal the heavenly
 secrets.”
 “Fine.”
 Tang Wan sighed. The two of them were like
 grandfather and granddaughter as they
 chatted.
 After being enlightened by Han Jue, Tang
 Wan’s bad mood was swept away and she happily went back to cultivate.
 Han Jue looked at her back and sighed. To be
 able to be distracted by love, this was human nature. How interesting.
 He had already lost this ability, so he missed
 it.
 The villa was pleasant and had beautiful mountains and rivers. It was like a paradise in
 was peace, but in the Dao Field, he was just sitting there.
 From time to time, new phenomena and new living beings would appear in this forest. There were always changes throughout the
 year. Han Jue suddenly felt the world moving.
 At this moment, a figure appeared in the
 universe outside. He raised this mortal world with one hand and walked out of the universe. The current Endless Era was divided into the
 Great Dao World, the Great World, and the Little World.
 The Great Dao World contained countless
 worlds, and every world was like a universe, containing myriad worlds.
 So it was done by Formless World. He wanted to contact all the Great Dao Worlds and establish a neutral land. Other than giving the
 juniors a chance to join powerful factions, it was also to strengthen himself.
 In the eyes of the various factions, it was not a loss to only produce one mortal world. They could even form a Formless World. Formless World was not taking advantage of him for nothing. He had to use all his resources to
 develop the Dao Mystic Realm and control the
 mortal worlds to affect the various Great Dao Worlds.
 It required a long time and endless resources
 to nurture so many mortal worlds. Coincidentally, this world was chosen.
 It was just nice to be a stage for Chu Xiaoqi.
 He calculated that it would take five thousand
 years for this mortal world to fuse with the Dao Mystic Realm. When he reached the Dao Mystic Realm, he still had to wait for a period
 of time.
 Five thousand years was enough for Chu Xiaoqi to accumulate considerable strength. Han Jue felt that Chu Xiaoqi still lacked the
 personality of an expert. He thought for a moment and sent a dream to someone. Several days later.
 A man passed through the clouds and arrived
 at the villa.
 Chu Xiaoqi and Tang Wan felt the terrifying
 aura and walked out of the house, looking up. A handsome man in purple divine armor
 stood in the void. He looked around and suddenly saw Han Jue. He immediately knelt down and bowed.
 Chu Xiaoqi and Tang Wan were stunned. The armored man seemed to sense them.
 Then, he landed in front of Chu Xiaoqi and
 said, “From today onwards, I’ll teach you cultivation.”
 This person was Han Tuo.
 Han Tuo sized up Chu Xiaoqi expressionlessly.
 He was a little glad. He did not expect his second brother to have a son. Chu Xiaoqi asked nervously, “Who are you?”
 Tang Wan said in a low voice, “Don’t you think he looks very similar to Grandpa?” Han Tuo said, “That’s right. The grandfather
 you’re talking about is my father, my
 biological father.” Chu Xiaoqi’s eyes lit up. He immediately went
 forward and rubbed his hands to please him. “Then you’re my uncle!”
 He had tried to pull strings, but he did not expect it to work so well.
 Han Tuo said, “I will teach you for a hundred
 years. Not only cultivation but also fighting.” “Alright! Alright!”
 “It’ll be tough.’ “I’m not afraid of suffering!”
 Han Tuo nodded in satisfaction.
 Chu Xiaoqi added, “Count her in.” He pointed at Tang Wan. Han Tuo shook his head. “My cultivation technique is not suitable for women.”


 Chu Xiaoqi was convinced by Han Tuo’s appearance. Such a figure was definitely a very powerful cultivator. He looked forward to his teaching, but in less than a day, he regretted it.
 At the back of the villa.
 Han Tuo established a barrier independently. The internal space was larger than the entire mortal world. Although Chu Xiaoqi was surprised, he did not realize how big the space inside this barrier was.
 Chu Xiaoqi lay in the ruins, panting heavily. His clothes were ragged and he was covered in blood. He was in an extremely miserable state.
 He looked at the high and mighty Han Tuo, his eyes filled with despair.
 “Uncle, can you stop?”
 “I’m not your uncle. We’re enemies now. The enemy won’t let you rest in a battle of life and death!”
 “But I’ve used up all my spirit energy…”
 Han Tuo attacked Chu Xiaoqi again. The power was extremely terrifying. Chu Xiaoqi felt that if he did not dodge, he might really die. He had no choice but to grit his teeth and dodge.
 After seven days, Chu Xiaoqi finally came out of the barrier.
 He dragged his injured body as he went to find Han Jue. Tang Wan covered her mouth when she saw him, but she didn’t say anything. After all, the one who taught Chu Xiaoqi was Han Jue’s biological son. He was trustworthy.
 Chu Xiaoqi came in front of Han Jue and cried.
 This time, Han Jue’s heart didn’t soften. He didn’t let him off no matter how much he pleaded.
 Chu Xiaoqi left helplessly.
 Then, Han Tuo came to visit him respectfully.
 He didn’t dare to be as unreasonable as Chu Xiaoqi. Facing Han Jue, he still felt distant because he was experienced and knew how strong his father was.
 Han Jue began to preach the Dao. The father and son didn’t need to exchange pleasantries. It was more realistic to directly preach the Dao.
 He used the power of time, making this lecture independent of time. Only a few days had passed when Han Tuo finished listening to the Dao.
 Han Tuo found Chu Xiaoqi again and ignored his resistance. He carried the kid into the
 barrier.
 Tang Wan was a little worried about Chu
 Xiaoqi, so she found Han Jue. Seeing that she couldn’t change this matter, she could only
 give up.
 This time, Chu Xiaoqi stayed in the barrier for a long time. Of course, he was forced to do it.
 One day, Xing Hongxuan returned.
 She entered Han Jue’s residence and pounced into his arms. She acted coquettishly like Chu Xiaoqi and talked about what she had seen and heard during this period of time.
 Han Jue listened patiently.
 In the end, Xing Hongxuan asked him about
 his plan for Chu Xiaoqi. Calling Han Tuo over was enough to show how much he valued this
 kid.
 Chu Xiaoqi was her only grandson, so she naturally had to care.
 Xing Hongxuan frowned in joy. “Aren’t you
 going to tell Huang’er about this?”
 “No need. That kid is busy building his Primordial Chaos. Besides, he might not have
 this son in his heart at all.”
 “But if that’s the case, this father and son
 will…”
 “Huang’er also needs to be corrected,” Han Jue said meaningfully. If he nurtured other descendants to surpass Han Huang, this fellow would only be angry. However, if it was
 a son who he was guilty towards, that would
 be a different story.
 Xing Hongxuan smiled. “I think you just dote on Xiaoqi. How can you be so unreasonable?” “That’s right, I dote on him. As the master of the Endless Era, do I need to worry about anything when I dote on someone?”
 “Yes, yes, yes. You’re the best. I’m going to bring Tang Wan away. Her potential is too poor. She won’t be able to keep up with Xiaoqi
 sooner or later.”
 kid to work hard.”
 “You’re really something.”
 Xing Hongxuan also found it interesting and
 even began to look forward to Chu Xiaoqi’s reaction.
 That day, she found Tang Wan and showed her ability. Tang Wan was pleasantly surprised and immediately acknowledged her as her master.
 When Xing Hongxuan suggested bringing her
 away and not seeing Chu Xiaoqi for a long time, she immediately panicked and hesitated.
 Ever since her brother died, Chu Xiaoqi had
 been her only family. Furthermore, she had always loved him as he always protected her.
 How could she abandon him for opportunities? “Forget it. I can’t leave him.”
 Tang Wan sighed and her eyes became firm.
 For the sake of love, giving up longevity was undoubtedly a huge determination.
 She could also tell that Han Jue only cared
 about Chu Xiaoqi. She was only a side character.
 Xing Hongxuan smiled. “Cultivators can live
 for more than a thousand years or ten thousand years. As the difference in your cultivation levels increases, you won’t be able to keep up with him sooner or later.”
 She waved her right hand, and a memory surged into Tang Wan’s mind.
 The difference between life and death. This memory was very short. There were no
 words, but silence was better than words. When Tang Wan woke up, she was deeply
 stimulated and sweat broke out on her forehead.
 After struggling for a long time, she finally
 agreed and followed Xing Hongxuan to cultivate.
 Half a year later.
 Chu Xiaoqi finally came out of the barrier.
 This time, he seemed to have been reborn. He
 was like an unsheathed sword, revealing its sharpness.
 This time, he didn’t look for Han Jue but Tang
 Wan. However, he only found a jade slip in her house. He injected spirit energy and a shadow appeared. It was Tang Wan. “Brother Xiaoqi, I’ll have already left when
 you see this letter. I’ve obtained the favor of
 an immortal. She wants to bring me to the Immortal World to cultivate. Actually, I’ve always liked you, but you don’t seem to like me enough.
 “I didn’t want to leave you at first, but then I saw the future. Without opportunities, I can’t keep up with you. You’ll still be young when I
 die. I don’t want this. I want to walk side by side with you.’
 ||
 Tang Wan’s eyes turned red as she continued,
 “I have to cultivate and catch up to you. However, my only regret is that I don’t know
 if
 you like me. Grandpa said that we are fated,
 but are we really?
 “Brother Xiaoqi, see you in the future. We will
 definitely meet as long as you don’t forget me.”
 Tang Wan’s shadow dissipated. Chu Xiaoqi stood in front of the table and
 remained silent.
 Several days passed, but Chu Xiaoqi did not leave Tang Wan’s room.
 Han Tuo sat at the edge of the cliff as his thoughts drifted. He also thought of the most important woman in his life. His old friend
 He could revive that person, but he felt that it would only be a shell, not the true person. Some people and some things could be placed in his memories. Half a month later.
 Chu Xiaoqi finally came out. He still didn’t
 look for Han Jue or ask if the immortal who took Tang Wan away was related to his grandfather. He directly found Han Tuo and continued cultivating. They entered the barrier again. Han Jue walked out of the house and stood in
 the courtyard, enjoying the sunlight. He smiled.
 Since he had nothing to do, he stretched and checked his emails. Soon, he saw a noteworthy email. [Your disciple Ji Xianshen has crossed the
 Origin Space-time. His karma has been severed.]


 Han Jue opened his friends list. Ji Xianshen’s portrait was still there. He was not dead.
 However, he observed the Endless Era and couldn’t find Ji Xianshen at all. He couldn’t even find the past or the future, including his own past.
 Han Jue’s cultivation was outstanding, so he could still remember Ji Xianshen. However, other than him, everyone had forgotten about him, including the Hidden Sect disciples. It was as if Ji Xianshen had never existed in the world.
 “Interesting. Origin Space-time…”
 Han Jue wanted to visit him in his dreams, but he couldn’t. He couldn’t find Ji Xianshen at all.
 He had no choice but to use the system’s derivation function.
 “I want to know Ji Xianshen’s location.”
 [Unable to derive its karma. Can’t be found in the blank domain.]
 Interesting.
 “Does Ji Xianshen have a chance to surpass me?”
 Although he was a disciple, people would change. He still had to be wary.
 If he couldn’t save him, he had to be careful if the other party would benefit from a disaster and surpass him.
 If there was hope, Han Jue would not curse Ji Xianshen. He would only cultivate harder. If he encountered Ji Xianshen in the future, he would face him with extreme caution.
 [600 trillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [Forever impossible. To reach the Creator
 Lord Realm, one has to surpass the Primordial Fiendcelestial’s potential. The Origin
 Space-time doesn’t have such an opportunity or possibility.]
 Han Jue was relieved.
 His system was formed by the blank domain consciousness. It was equivalent to the greatest opportunity of the blank domain. It was nurtured by countless predecessors, and it was very difficult for anyone to catch up to him.
 However, Han Jue still didn’t let down his guard. Just because Ji Xianshen couldn’t, it didn’t mean that others couldn’t.
 He did not ask the system if there was a
 possibility of him being surpassed.
 He was afraid that the answer would be
 ‘impossible to surpass’.
 Han Jue didn’t want to relax.
 Origin Space-time?
 Han Jue had an idea. He immediately created
 Then, he continued reading the emails.
 Sect.
 Some disciples began to have conflicts.
 This was like fighting for a country. When fighting, everyone was united. Once they unified the world, they began to fight for power. Han Jue couldn’t forcefully stop this situation. Even if he was enslaved by the Ultimate Origin Heavenly Prison, he was loyal to Han Jue and not absolutely kind to others.
 Han Jue let it pass. Every family had their own difficulties. He would let them fight among themselves.
 For the next period of time, Chu Xiaoqi immersed himself in the barrier as if he had gone mad. He stayed inside for eighty years.
 Eighty years later, Chu Xiaoqi walked out of the barrier and came to visit him.
 His appearance did not change, but his body was clearly much stronger. There was a murderous aura between his brows.
 All these years, his cultivation level had almost not increased, but his strength had changed drastically.
 The first thing Chu Xiaoqi said when he saw him was, “Grandpa, when can I see Wan’er?”
 This kid was not stupid and guessed who the mastermind was, but he didn’t beg Han Jue to let them meet because he knew that this was the best path for them.
 Han Jue said, “You will naturally see her
 when the time is right. Marriage requires your own efforts, not waiting.”
 Chu Xiaoqi was deep in thought. He suddenly grinned and said, “I’ll cultivate
 for a thousand years first. During this period of time, find a few hundred concubines to play with. This girl is easily jealous, so I can’t let her discover it.”
 that he was changing the topic. Chu Xiaoqi didn’t have a chance to find any mistresses
 now.
 “Grandpa, what’s your son’s name? All these
 years, when I asked him, he didn’t answer. He’s really strong. Is he a Mahayana cultivator?” Chu Xiaoqi asked expectantly.
 Now, he admired Han Tuo the most. All these
 years of cultivation made him unable to imagine what Han Tuo had experienced.
 Han Jue smiled. “He will say it when he needs
 to.”
 “But he’s leaving!”
 “Fine.”
 Chu Xiaoqi sighed. He was indeed too weak.
 Otherwise, his brother wouldn’t have died and he and Tang Wan wouldn’t have been hunted
 down. Outside the door, Han Tuo bowed to Han Jue
 and directly jumped out of this Great Dao World. At this moment, with Chu Xiaoqi’s speed, it would take countless billions of years to arrive.
 Han Jue asked, “What do you plan to do next? Continue cultivating or go out and adventure?”
 Chu Xiaoqi thought for a moment and then
 said, “Cultivate. Although I’m already very strong, I’m not invincible in the world. Being by your side is the greatest opportunity in the world. Why run around?”
 Chu Xiaoqi smiled proudly and started to massage Han Jue’s back and shoulders.
 No matter how old he was, he would always be that youth in front of him. The grandfather and grandson chatted for a
 while before Chu Xiaoqi went to cultivate. Han Jue also continued cultivating. To the current him, cultivating was the same no
 matter the place. After reaching the Creator Lord Realm, he no longer needed to cultivate
 The cultivation technique Han Jue taught Chu
 Xiaoqi was enough for him to cultivate to the Mahayana Realm, so he didn’t disturb Han Jue in the following days. Years passed. Spring and autumn alternated.
 Things changed in the world. The villa stood in seclusion. Five hundred years passed quickly. Chu Xiaoqi was transcending the Mahayana
 through
 Realm tribulation and was preparing to break to the Loose Immortal Realm. He was extremely nervous as he faced this tribulation. As long as he succeeded, he could
 ascend to the Immortal World and find Tang Wan.
 He was also a little nervous. Would she still
 like him after getting used to the situation in the Immortal World?
 These hundreds of years were very short for
 Han Jue, but they were torturous to Chu Xiaoqi.
 How many days and nights had he missed
 her?
 In the past, when Tang Wan was by his side, he did not like her. But he missed her now that she was gone. Han Jue walked out to the courtyard and
 looked at Chu Xiaoqi transcending the tribulation.
 Although Chu Xiaoqi was nervous, Han Jue already guessed that he could successfully transcend it.
 Indeed, 49 days later, Chu Xiaoqi became a
 Loose Immortal. A pillar of light descended from the sky and covered him. It broke through the sky and pulled him up. Chu Xiaoqi turned to look at the villa. After reaching the Mahayana Realm, he could see countless ghosts hidden in the villa. They were all suppressed under the villa by the mysterious Dharmic powers.
 No wonder he felt that it was sinister back then. There were really ghosts here… So it was Grandpa who was protecting them… Chu Xiaoqi shouted, “Grandpa, I’m about to ascend. See you in the Immortal World in the future!”
 The power of ascension was too strong. He could not stop at all and was forcefully ascended.
 “Grandpa, I’ll always remember you. I’ll
 definitely be filial to you if I have the chance
 in the future!” Chu Xiaoqi continued to shout, his voice resounding through the sky.
 At this moment, Han Jue’s voice floated up,
 “In that case, don’t ascend.”
