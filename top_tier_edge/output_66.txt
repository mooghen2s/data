 20% failure rate was too high!
 He might even have the possibility of being killed!
 Han Jue couldn’t help but think of the experience of playing games for ordinary people in his previous life. If the chance of strengthening was less than 100%, there was no difference between a 1% and 90% success rate.
 Moreover, he was facing an enemy in reality. He had to be even more cautious.
 He had to kill the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit with at least 100% confidence before he could attack.
 “I’ll let you live for a while longer,” Han Jue thought silently.
 The Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit had to die. The Ultimate God of Punishment could be imprisoned in the Primordial Heavenly Prison.
 It was impossible for Han Jue to enslave all the enemies. That would easily expose the Primordial Heavenly Prison and not be a deterrent.
  An enemy had to die to show that the price of provoking him was eternal damnation.
 Han Jue checked the emails.
 (Your disciple Dao Sovereign’s body has been baptized by the Ancient Desolate Spring. His physical potential has increased dramatically.)
 (Your disciple Zhao Xuanyuan’s body…]
 [Your disciple Zhou Fan’s body has been baptized by the Ancient Desolate Spring. His physical potential has increased dramatically.]
 (Your descendant Han Yu’s body has been baptized by the Ancient Desolate Spring. His physical potential has increased dramatically.]
 (Your good friend Huang Zuntian has absorbed the power of the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority and attained the Great Dao.]
 [Your good friend Foolish Sword Sage encountered your enemy, Ancestor Tian Xu, and was severely injured.)
 All the geniuses captured in the Ancient Desolate were baptized by the Ancient Desolate Spring
 Tsk tsk, was this still an opportunity?
 These geniuses would benefit from a disaster as long as someone could kill the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit.
 Han Jue thought silently.
 There was another possibility. After this, it would be difficult to kill the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit because these geniuses were his clones.
 However, it was fine. The Dark Forbidden Lord would take action if the Divine Might Heavenly Sage couldn’t deal with the enemy!
 Han Jue was relieved after reading all the emails and confirming that no good friends had died.
 Those who could enter his circle of friends were all special existences. They were all very difficult to kill. He didn’t care about the mortals and disciples who had a favorable impression and hatred towards him at a glance.
 After surviving the attack of the Dao Creator, the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit looked around the Chaos. Other than Han Jue, he really couldn’t find an opponent.
 Han Jue stopped thinking and continued cultivating
 He had to reach the perfected Great Dao Supreme Realm first!
 Circular platforms floated above the clouds under the blue sky. On one of the vast circular platforms, dozens of Great Dao Divine Spirits gathered. The Five Great Divine Punishers also came.
 They were chatting with each other and waiting for the Ultimate God of Punishment to appear.
 “Yes, that Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit has abducted countless geniuses. It has already affected the future of the Chaos. We have to control it.”
 “I wonder what the Ultimate God thinks.”
 “He probably wants to suppress the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have called us here.”
  Some Great Dao Divine Spirits definitely did not like peace. Peace meant that they couldn’t show their power, which meant that they couldn’t enjoy their status.
 Han Tuo and Yi Tian were expressionless and did not participate in their discussion.
 Not long after, the Ultimate God of Punishment appeared. All the Great Dao Divine Spirits bowed.
 The Ultimate God of Punishment scanned everyone and said, “I called you here today for one thing, which is the Ancient Desolate!”
 The Ultimate God of Punishment’s eyes were sharp. “We won’t interfere!”
 Whoosh
 All the Great Dao Divine Spirits were moved. They didn’t expect such an order.
 He thought that the Ultimate God of Punishment would definitely suppress the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit. He had only been in seclusion and did not know about this.
 Han Tuo frowned.
 He also wanted to go to the Ancient Desolate and save some of his good friends.
 Now, more than a hundred thousand geniuses had gone missing in the Ancient Desolate. Dao Devils were also running rampant in the Chaos. They captured geniuses everywhere and brought them back to the Ancient Desolate, causing all the living beings in the Chaos to be terrified and uneasy. They were waiting for the Great Dao Divine Spirit to take action and resolve this danger.
 The Ultimate God of Punishment glanced at Yi Tian and said, “I’ve already reached an agreement with the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit. His goal is only to take revenge on the Heavenly Dao and not threaten the Chaos. As for those words, they were deliberately spread by the Dark Forbidden Lord’s minions. The geniuses captured by the Ancient Desolate are not dead. Instead, they will obtain a huge opportunity.”
 The Great Dao Divine Spirits looked at each other.
 Han Tuo couldn’t help but ask, “Does the Heavenly Dao not care anymore?”
 The Divine Robe Daoist frowned.
 The Heavenly Dao was under his jurisdiction. Not to mention his loyalty to Han Jue, he would also be affected once the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit attacked.
 The Ultimate God of Punishment said, “The Heavenly Dao suppressed the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit. Could it be that we won’t let the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit take revenge? It’s fine as long as it doesn’t threaten the Chaos. The peace of the Chaos is the overall situation. We can’t implicate the entire Chaos over a personal grudge. For the Heavenly Dao today, who will it be tomorrow? We Great Dao Divine Spirits want to protect the order and control all living beings, not resolve grudges for all living beings everywhere. The grudges in this world can’t be resolved at all.”
 Many Great Dao Divine Spirits nodded.
 In fact, the Great Dao Divine Spirits were all unhappy with the Heavenly Dao because it was too sharp.
 Especially that Divine Might Heavenly Sage. All living beings regarded him as the strongest. How could they stand it?
 “That’s right! Ultimate God is right!”
 “If the geniuses are fine, the Ancient Desolate won’t threaten the Chaos.”
 “Ultimate God is really powerful. So you’ve long contacted the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit.”
 “The Heavenly Dao’s grudge should indeed not involve the Chaos. Besides, didn’t the Dao Ancestor cause enough hatred for the Heavenly Dao in the past?”
 “I think it’s feasible.”
 Han Tuo and Yi Tian’s expressions turned ugly.
  The Ultimate God of Punishment knew their origins. By openly targeting the Heavenly Dao, he was undoubtedly telling them that they were already abandoned.
 The Ultimate God of Punishment waved his sleeve and said, “All Divine Spirits are not allowed to interfere. If anyone dares to participate, their Deity Position will be removed!”
 With that, he vanished.
 Han Tuo turned around and left. Yi Tian and the other three Divine Punishers hurriedly followed.
 The Great Dao Divine Spirits smiled mockingly at them.
 They had always disliked the Five Great Divine Punishers. Their cultivation levels were low and they were still suppressing them. Fortunately, the Ultimate God of Punishment no longer cared about their reputation.
 After leaving the Ultimate God World, a Divine Punisher caught up to Han Tuo and asked, “Brother, what do you want to do?”
 Han Tuo stopped. “I have to care about the Heavenly Dao, but you don’t have to. You can stay here!”


 Among the Five Great Divine Punishers, Han Tuo and Yi Tian were the most famous, but the other three were not jealous. This was because every time they encountered a life and death crisis, Yi Tian and Han Tuo would try their best to save them, even if they might lose themselves. Their brotherhood was already indestructible.
 Yi Tian cursed. “What are you waiting for? We’re all brothers. Why are you still playing such tricks? The three of you, listen up. Follow me to guard the Heavenly Dao and fight the Dao Devils. What Ancestor Tian Xu? What Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit? Won’t his reputation increase if he’s killed by the five of us?”
 The three Divine Punishers smiled and shouted. They weren’t afraid of anything.
 Han Tuo smiled helplessly, but his heart warmed.
 With brothers like this, what else could he ask for in life?
 “Alright! Then we’ll go together!”
 Han Tuo laughed. He wasn’t afraid that the Ultimate God of Punishment would hear him. Although the two sides did not say anything directly, they had already broken up.
 The Five Great Divine Punishers were about to leave when the Divine Robe Daoist caught up.
  “Five Divine Punishers, don’t be anxious. Why don’t you wait in my Dao Field?”
 The Divine Robe Daoist cupped his hands and smiled warmly.
 The five Divine Punishers looked at each other.
 Yi Tian rolled his eyes and smiled. “Then go. We’ll talk when you’re there!”
 “That’s right, that’s right!”
 The Divine Robe Daoist smiled and looked at him with admiration.
 Han Tuo hesitated for a moment but still nodded in agreement.
 The order regarding the Ultimate God of Punishment did not spread in the Chaos, but as the Great Dao Divine Spirits knew how to take sides, the forces heading to the Ancient Desolate began to decrease.
 The Great Dao Divine Spirits looked high and mighty, but each controlled different major factions. Under the major factions, there were countless connections. They could send messages at the first level and have great influence. Any faction that had a foothold in the Chaos would have their greatest backing on a Great Dao Divine Spirit.
 Gradually, the Ancient Desolate calmed down.
 The Heavenly Dao also sensed that something was wrong.
 In the Universal Hall.
 The Sages gathered.
 Heavenly Venerate Wufa frowned. “Recently, it seems that the various factions no longer target the Ancient Desolate, other than the forces of heaven and earth in this domain.”
 Divine Might Buddha asked, “Is it because the Ancient Desolate is too strong?”
 “Something’s wrong. Even the number of scouts has decreased by more than half.”
 Pan Xin shook his head. A hint of fear appeared in his eyes at the mention of the Ancient Desolate.
 He had once tried to enter the Ancient Desolate, but he had returned in failure and almost died inside even with the Killing Dao Token.
 The Sages’ expressions were solemn.
 Unlike in the past, the enemy had already appeared this time, but he did not attack the Heavenly Dao. The Heavenly Dao knew where the other party was, but it couldn’t do anything
 How many mighty figures had gone to the Ancient Desolate and suffered a crushing defeat? The pressure on the Heavenly Dao was naturally huge.
 Qiu Xilai narrowed his eyes. “I feel that someone might be pushing this matter from behind. Could it be that the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit has negotiated with other factions? Their current goal is to flatten the Heavenly Dao?”
 The Sages panicked.
 It was not impossible.
  After all, the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit didn’t say that he wanted to overturn the Chaos.
 If the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit only wanted to deal with the Heavenly Dao, just like in the past, no one would help no matter how strong the Heavenly Dao’s enemies were.
 The Sages nodded and felt that it made sense.
 Xu Dudao smiled. “In the past hundreds of thousands of years, our cultivation levels have increased one after another. I have to say that the providence of the Heavenly Dao is indeed useful. I’m also about to attain Freedom.”
 Speaking of cultivation, the Sages smiled. The providence of sacrificing the Heavenly Dao caused the cultivation levels of all the Sages to increase. Ten Freedom Sages had already been born and would continue to increase.
 The Freedom Sage was only referring to the cultivation realm here. The Heavenly Dao Sage was not as carefree as the Freedom Sage and was forever restricted by the Heavenly Dao.
 Everyone’s gaze landed on Heavenly Venerate Wufa, Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du, and the three Sages. They had the greatest hope.
 Although the Sacred True Martial Buddha of the Buddhist World was at the perfected Freedom Realm, he was still an outsider, after all. He couldn’t use the providence of the Heavenly Dao to break through. His cultivation had already been stuck for countless years. It was difficult for him to attain the Great Dao without a huge opportunity. The three Sages looked extremely confident in the eyes of the Sages.
 They were determined to reach the Great Dao Realm!
 Especially Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du!
 If he wanted to sit firmly on the second throne of the Heavenly Dao, he had to cross the Great Dao Realm. Otherwise, it would be very difficult for him to convince the masses.
 “Regarding the Ancient Desolate, continue to keep an eye on it. At the same time, the development of the Heavenly Dao can’t fall behind. We have to continue opening more Chaotic Heavenly Roads. There aren’t enough Chaotic Cities, either. We have to set up a tight defensive line. We won’t give the Dao Devils a chance to enter the Heavenly Dao,” Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du instructed. The Sages nodded and dispersed.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du revealed a worried expression when he was alone.
 The power of the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit exceeded his imagination.
 “Even Teacher is not his match. Can the Heavenly Sage kill the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit?” Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du thought silently.
 He recalled the calamities in the past. Han Jue could always kill enemies forcefully. This was his confidence.
 If not for Han Jue, how could he dare to return to the Heavenly Dao without hesitation?
 “In that case, I’ll believe him until the end!” Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du thought firmly. He knew his limits. No matter how strong his management ability was, the Heavenly Dao was still protected by the Divine Might Heavenly Sage.
 Logically speaking, he had to rely on Han Jue now. Even if he returned to Laozi, he would only be ostracized.
 Only by walking a path to the end was it correct!
 Inside the Daoist temple.
 Han Jue opened his eyes. The Ultimate Origin Power in his body had transformed again in the past hundred thousand years. It was extremely powerful.
  His current strength had already reached an indescribable level. With a glance, he could make the Heavenly Dao cease to exist.
 So powerful!
 It was uncatchable, unfathomable, and unpredictable, but it contained a fatal and domineering destructive power!
 In a sense, Han Jue was no longer a Great Dao Supreme. He had reached an even stronger realm, but he was just inferior to a Dao Creator.
 Han Jue’s gaze landed on the Primordial World.
 The Life Fiendcelestial was hiding in a star to cultivate. During this period of time, three balls of Fiendcelestial Qi transformed into Chaotic Fiendcelestials, and they lived in different places.
 At this rate, a large amount of Fiendcelestial Qi would be successfully nurtured in the next million years.
 Han Jue was looking forward to it!


 Although he was prepared to create the Primordial Chaos, he had no intention of giving up on the Heavenly Dao.
 No matter what, in this life, all his footprints were in the Heavenly Dao. He was a nostalgic person. He would protect the Heavenly Dao if he could.
 It was not only his footprints. His old friends were all focused on the Heavenly Dao.
 Unknowingly, Han Jue had already taken on the responsibility of protecting the Heavenly Dao. In the past, he would definitely resist, but now, he enjoyed it.
 This was strength!
 Han Jue discovered that he looked at all the living beings in the Heavenly Dao as if he was looking at his descendants. He felt an inexplicable familiarity.
 It was not only the humans. All the Heavenly Dao Race were the same.
 The Heavenly Dao had all sorts of forms. The myriad worlds and mountains had their own styles. This was a vitality that other worlds in the Chaos did not possess.
  The Chaotic World had its own form, but it had no good intentions.
 The beauty of the Heavenly Dao Heaven and Earth was in the vitality of all living beings, the unpredictable sun, moon, mountains, and rivers, and the emotions of all living beings.
 Han Jue suddenly wanted to travel the Immortal World again. To be precise, he wanted to travel the mortal world. He wanted to be a mortal and experience the various forms of life.
 However, not for the time being. He had to kill the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit first.
 Several hours later.
 He returned to the third Dao Field and continued cultivating.
 It had been 1.4 million years since his last breakthrough. According to his estimation, he would break through to the perfected realm in at most five hundred thousand years.
 That would be the time of the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit’s death!
 Han Jue was already looking forward to it.
 In the depths of the Ancient Desolate, in a vast lake.
 Countless figures floated on the surface of the lake. They looked like corpses, but their bodies were intact. There were humans, demons, and devils.
 The surface of the lake was covered in fog, like a world of mist. It was murky in all directions.
 At this moment, Ancestor Tian Xu and the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit floated above the clouds and looked down at the countless figures on the lake.
 “Divine Spirit, there are already a million Ancient Desolate clones and more than a hundred billion Dao Devils. When are we attacking?” Ancestor Tian Xu asked.
 The Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit replied, “It’s not enough. We have to be confident. The reason why the Heavenly Dao can withstand several seemingly impossible calamities is that the enemy is not prepared enough and can’t flatten the Heavenly Dao in one go.”
 Ancestor Tian Xu became silent.
 He hesitated for a moment and said, “The Heavenly Dao is also preparing. The Divine Might Heavenly Sage’s potential is unparalleled. He has been in seclusion recently. I’m afraid…”
 The Divine Might Heavenly Sage’s reputation was too resounding. Those battle achievements were enough to intimidate all the mighty figures in the Chaos.
 The Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit said, “I know how powerful he is, so I want to nurture a Dao Devil. Cultivation slows down when one reaches the Great Dao Supreme Realm. No matter how talented he is, it’s impossible for him to surpass the Great Dao Supreme Realm in millions of years.”
 Ancestor Tian Xu thought about it and felt that it made sense.
 He turned to look at the million geniuses on the lake, deep in thought.
 “The battle of the Heavenly Dao is very important. Not only are the Great Dao Divine Spirits watching, but there are also those supreme existences. If they win, they will surpass the Chaos from now on. If they lose, they will be doomed,” the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit said coldly.
 Ancestor Tian Xu recalled the mysterious existence who had severed the Ancient Desolate and shivered.
 The Chaos seemed to have entered their eyes, but there were also many unknown places and existences hidden.
 The higher one’s cultivation level was, the greater their reverence for the Chaos.
 Ancestor Tian Xu shook his head and looked in the Heavenly Dao’s direction. An old figure appeared in his mind.
 “Where are you now?”
  Time passed quickly. Han Jue was indifferent in the Daoist temple no matter how the chaos changed, as if time and everything had lost their meaning on him.
 He opened his eyes three times, which meant that three hundred thousand years had
 passed.
 This was the third time. At this moment, three lines of notifications appeared in front of him.
 (You are 9 million years old and your life has taken another step forward. You have the following choices:]
 [1: Exit seclusion immediately and open the Primordial Chaos in the Chaos. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment, a Creation Spirit Stone, and a Primordial Fragment.]
 [2: Cultivate in a low-profile manner and stay away from trouble. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment, a Creation Spirit Stone, and a Primordial Fragment.)
 Such an option was not surprising. Only when he was ten million years old would he receive a huge reward.
 Han Jue silently chose the second option.
 This time, he did not use the Creation Spirit Stone to create a Chaotic Fiendcelestial because the Primordial World could already nurture Chaotic Fiendcelestials itself.
 He would save it up and use it in the future.
 He continued to cultivate.
 He wasn’t far from breaking through.
 Han Jue only had one goal now.
 He hoped to personally go to the Ancient Desolate before the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit made a move.
 On the other side.
 In the Great Dao Breakthrough Domain.
 Han Huang, the Divine Robe Daoist, and the five Divine Punishers gathered here.
 In these hundreds of thousands of years, the remaining three Divine Punishers had also reached the Great Dao Realm.
 After hearing everyone’s words, Han Huang was furious and cursed. “What leader of the Divine Spirits? I think he’s just afraid of the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit!
 “If not for Father not letting me out, I really want to flatten the Ancient Desolate!”
 Han Tuo shook his head. “Although you’re a Great Dao Sage, you’re still far from defeating the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit.”
 Han Huang frowned in displeasure.
 Yi Tian cursed. “It’s fine. There’s still time. There’s been no movement in the Ancient Desolate. They’re probably afraid of my godfather.”
 Divine Punisher Chi Fa said, “I’m guessing that the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit is still creating Dao Devils. Hundreds of thousands of years ago, the number of Dao Devils in the Ancient Desolate had already reached an immeasurable number. The Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit is still at it because he’s afraid of repeating the defeat of the ten thousand Divine Authority Generals.”
 Since they were close, Han Huang would not be polite. He would say it directly if he was unhappy.
 He believed that he was already powerful enough.
 He was already two million years old and cultivated diligently every day. Even if he was inferior to his father, he felt that very few people in the Chaos were his match. It was just that he had no chance to show off.
 off?”
 Han Huang snorted.


 Han Tuo said, “That’s right, it’s the Three Pure Sacred World. Laozi went to the Ancient Desolate and was severely injured. After that, traces of Dao Devils were detected in the Three Pure Sacred World. Laozi has probably already been possessed by the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit.”
 The Divine Robe Daoist nodded and sighed. “We underestimated the Ancient Desolate. It looks calm, but it’s probably plotting to surround the Heavenly Dao.
 !!
 “The Great Dao Divine Spirit is one, and the Three Pure Sacred World is another. When the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit attacks…”
 He did not continue, but everyone understood.
 Han Huang nodded. “I understand. I’ll inform them.”
 With that, he vanished.
  Yi Tian scratched his head and smiled. “This kid is really anxious. He’s even more anxious than me.”
 Han Tuo shook his head and laughed.
 The Divine Robe Daoist smiled. “He’s not in a hurry to cultivate.”
 After his consciousness returned to his body, Han Huang directly visited Xing Hongxuan. She could contact the Hidden Sect disciples. There was no need to alarm Han Jue.
 After knowing this, Xing Hongxuan entered the Myriad Worlds Projection. This matter quickly reached Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du’s ears.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du moved very quickly and began to deploy defenses against the invasion of the Three Pure Sacred World.
 Han Jue didn’t know about this. Even if he knew, he wouldn’t care.
 The Three Pure Sacred World was nothing in his eyes.
 He already felt the opportunity to break through, so he naturally had to work harder.
 Ten thousand years passed in a flash.
 Three thousand years later.
 He successfully broke through.
 There were no difficulties. In front of the Ultimate Origin Fiendcelestial, there was no realm tribulation. It was just constantly accumulating cultivation and constantly surpassing the limit.
 Perfected Great Dao Supreme!
 Perfected Great Dao!
 Han Jue’s Ultimate Origin Power transformed. The Primordial World expanded crazily and the nebulous Primordial Qi in the world increased even more, startling the Chaotic Fiendcelestials who were cultivating.
 At this point, they knew that there was a mysterious and powerful force in the Primordial World. They treated it as an illusory immortal.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and checked his attributes panel as he consolidated his cultivation.
 [Name: Han Jue]
 (Lifespan: 9,273,050 / 15,099,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,9 99,999,999,999,999,999]
 (Race: Ultimate Origin Fiendcelestial (Immeasurable Emperor)]
 (Cultivation: Perfected Great Dao Supreme Realm (Perfect Sage)]
 (Technique: Primordial Chaos Reincarnation Great Dao (Great Dao), Heavenly Cycle Body Tempering]
 (Great Dao: Great Dao of Life and Death, Great Dao of Karma, Great Dao of Extreme Origin]
 [Constitution: Extreme Dao Ultimate Origin Body]
 Han Jue was filled with a sense of achievement upon looking at such a long lifespan.
 This was his original intention in cultivation!
 This breakthrough was as he had expected. The Ultimate Origin Power increased exponentially, exceeding ten times before the breakthrough.
 When he was still a Primordial Fiendcelestial, every breakthrough brought about greater and greater strength, let alone now when he had already surpassed the Primordial Fiendcelestial.
 Han Jue finally consolidated his cultivation after thousands of years.
 Then, he began to cultivate the Grand Unity Aspect.
 Eighty-one years later, he finally gathered all three thousand Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols. This time, he even learned the Creation Fiendcelestial.
 usan
 The power of the three thousand Great Dao was in his grasp.
 The Primordial World shook when he condensed the remaining Fiendcelestial Qi.
 This vibration could not be felt in the world, but Han Jue felt it clearly. It could be said to be world-shattering, causing his soul to tremble.
 Time passed.
  Five thousand years later.
 The Daoist temple shone with red light. Han Jue’s robes fluttered and he emitted a great divine might.
 He slowly opened his eyes and looked at his hands. They were clean and white. There was nothing unusual on his palms, but in fact, they were wrapped in Ultimate Origin Power.
 This Ultimate Origin Power was mighty!
 Han Jue smiled and muttered, “Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit, you’re going to die.” “I want to know if I can insta-kill the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit?”
 [100 trillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 (There is a certain chance.]
 Wasn’t it 100%?
 It seemed to be related to those clones!
 “Can the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit kill me if I take it seriously?”
 [No]
 Han Jue smiled.
 That was good.
 He began the simulation trial and challenged three hundred thousand Foolish Sword Sages.
 This Mystical Power was called the Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal!
 The Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal contained the characteristics of imprisonment, destruction, creation, space, time, slaughter, and so on!
 Ten breaths later, Han Jue opened his eyes.
 With one move, the Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal directly crushed three hundred thousand Foolish Sword Sages!
 “The preparation time is a little long. I have to activate it instantly. The suction force has to be greater. No, I have to directly use the power of space to move the enemy in…” Han Jue muttered to himself. He had a thought and continued.
 After several simulation trials, he easily insta-killed three hundred thousand Foolish Sword Sages.
 Then, he increased the number of Foolish Sword Sages.
 Several days later.
 He easily insta-killed the million Foolish Sword Sages. He was invincible with the Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal.
 How lonely.
 Han Jue wanted to switch opponents, but he had already developed feelings and didn’t want to change after fighting with the Foolish Sword Sage for a long time.
 Moreover, the Foolish Sword Sage was not bad either. He was truly a Great Dao Supreme!
 Han Jue didn’t increase the number anymore. He already had an estimation of his strength. Besides, he had also deduced that he indeed had the power to insta-kill the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit.
 Han Jue stood up and walked out of the Daoist temple.
 He first visited Xing Hongxuan and Qingluan’er before going to Han Huang’s Daoist temple.
 After so many years, Han Huang was already at the late-stage Great Dao Primordial Chaos Realm.
 Not bad!
 Han Jue thought as he said, “Huangler.”
 Han Huang suddenly opened his eyes in shock. His father had actually silently arrived at his Daoist temple!
 He did not sense anything!
 Could it be that the difference between them was still so great?
 Han Huang had mixed feelings.
 He had thought that even if he was inferior to his father, the difference would not be as great as before.
 Now…
  “Father!”
 Han Huang stood up and bowed.
 Han Jue smiled. “Your cultivation has been good recently. It will take some time. I won’t stop you if you want to go to the Chaos. You should grow up.”
 Han Huang looked up in surprise.
 His cultivation was already at the top level of the Chaos and he could already be independent. He also yearned to be independent, but he was afraid of causing trouble for his father. After all, the fact that he was Han Jue’s biological son was very difficult to hide.
 As long as Han Jue had enemies, they would definitely use him as a breakthrough point.
 “Father, why do you suddenly say that?” Han Huang asked in confusion.
 “I’m happy! Thank you, Father!”
 Han Huang knelt down excitedly. He only knelt down to Han Jue. Not even Xing Hongxuan deserved it.


 Then, Han Jue found Han Qing’er. The father and daughter chatted longer, mainly because of Han Qing’er.
 Han Jue sighed upon looking at the chattering Han Qing’er.
 He felt closer to his daughter.
 It was as if she was still the same. Han Huang was not as cute as when he was young, so the father and son did not talk as much as before.
 The next day.
 Han Jue teleported to the main Dao Field and jumped into the Universal Hall outside the 33rd Heaven. Only Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du was meditating and cultivating in the hall.
 Han Jue called out. Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du woke up and hurriedly stood up to bow when he saw him.
 Han Jue waved his hand and smiled. “Sit down. Let’s chat.”
 Han Jue said, “To ask about the Heavenly Dao and the Ancient Desolate.”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du immediately began to report.
 The Heavenly Dao was still developing at a high speed. Currently, there were more than a hundred Chaotic Heavenly Roads and countless Chaotic Cities in all directions. All sorts of array formations had been set up. The Heavenly Dao would not panic even if the Three Pure Sacred World and the Ancient Desolate attacked now.
 As for the Ancient Desolate, there was still no movement.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du looked at Han Jue and said, “Heavenly Sage, so far, the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit is either recuperating or accumulating strength. It won’t attack the Heavenly Dao for the time being. You still have time to cultivate, and the Heavenly Dao also has time to prepare.”
 Han Jue said, “How many geniuses of the Heavenly Dao have been captured by the Ancient Desolate?”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said in a low voice, “More than five hundred, including Sages.”
 “Continue according to your plan.”
 Han Jue stood up and left.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du looked at his back and hesitated.
 He finally sighed after he disappeared.
 He had already seen the situation clearly. The Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit was not alone and helpless. He had already obtained the support of the Great Dao Divine Spirits.
 The truly helpless one was the Heavenly Dao.
 This was not the first time, but this time, the situation was even more serious than before.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du stopped thinking and closed his eyes to cultivate.
 Against the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit, it still depended on the Divine Might Heavenly Sage.
 He just had to protect the Heavenly Dao!
 Han Jue came to the Foolish Sword Sage’s Dao Field. He was pretty surprised to see Han Jue. The two of them began to chat.
 The Foolish Sword Sage had gone to the Ancient Desolate several times and was severely injured, but he could escape every time. After all, he was an existence who could escape from Han Jue.
 “Old Fool, don’t go to the Ancient Desolate in the future. Guard the Heavenly Dao,” Han Jue reminded with a concerned tone.
 The Foolish Sword Sage was like a cat whose tail had been stepped on. He immediately stomped his feet.
 “Ancestor Tian Xu is impressive, but give me time, I’ll kill him sooner or later!” The Foolish Sword Sage said angrily.
 He had always wanted to prove his strength in front of Han Jue, but the enemy was stronger.
 Han Jue smiled and said, “Old Fool, I know best how powerful you are. Are you in a hurry? Ancestor Tian Xu will die sooner or later. Why fuss about the dead?”
 The Divine Might Heavenly Sage was still the most eloquent.
 This was also the thing that the Foolish Sword Sage admired the most about Han Jue. He had clearly proved his strength, but he was never stingy with his praise when facing people weaker than him.
 “Heavenly Sage, you said that Ancestor Tian Xu is going to die?” The Foolish Sword Sage sat down and asked curiously.
 Han Jue smiled and said, “That’s right. I’m preparing to go to the Ancient Desolate.”
 Didn’t the Divine Might Heavenly Sage only guard the Heavenly Dao and not attack distant enemies?
 The Foolish Sword Sage immediately became excited. “I want to go too. I want to see Ancestor Tian Xu begging for mercy in front of you!”
 Thinking of Ancestor Tian Xu’s arrogance, he was furious.
 “No, the Heavenly Dao needs someone to guard it to prevent others from taking advantage of my absence,” Han Jue reminded him. The Foolish Sword Sage felt that it made sense.
 The two of them chatted for a while before Han Jue returned to the Daoist temple.
 He left a wisp of his will in the Daoist temple to prevent himself from dying outside and being unable to revive.
 He was about to leave when Han Huang suddenly came to visit.
 Han Jue hesitated for a moment but still let him in.
 “Father, after thinking about it, I feel that something is wrong. Are you preparing to go to the Ancient Desolate? Is that why you said that I can go out in the future?” Han Huang asked with a burning gaze.
 Han Jue nodded.
 Han Huang suppressed his excitement and said, “Father, bring me along. I want to see your true glory. I can protect myself even if I can’t help you now, right? I’ve already followed the Mystical Power you taught me and sent a wisp of my soul into the Daoist temple. I can revive even if I die outside!”
 Han Jue stared at him.
 Han Huang looked at his father fearlessly.
 After a long while…
 Han Jue smiled and said, “Then let’s go together.”
 With that, the father and son vanished from the Daoist temple and arrived in the Chaos.
 A red light under their feet carried them forward.
 The surrounding spatial turbulence quickly retreated. The red light shone on the father and son, making Han Huang extremely excited.
 “Father, we’re out?”
 “What space is this? I can’t see through it!”
 “Father, what’s your cultivation level?”
 Han Jue only smiled.
 The Ultimate Origin Power formed this spatial tunnel. It was independent of the Chaos and could go anywhere without being discovered.
 Apart from the Ultimate Origin Fiendcelestial, no one could forcefully barge in!
 Han Jue would also create Mystical Powers during his cultivation. For example, this spatial tunnel was formed by a Mystical Power and couldn’t be taught to others. Only the Ultimate Origin Fiendcelestial could master it.
 Seeing that Han Jue did not want to answer, Han Huang could only ask, “Father, what are you going to do when we reach the Ancient Desolate?”
 Han Jue said, “Suppress.” Han Huang asked, “You’ll forcefully fight? No plan? What if the other party escapes?”
 That was true!
 Han Huang clenched his fists as his blood boiled.
  This was the first time he went out to fight an enemy with his father!
 Han Huang had never killed an enemy after living for two million years. At most, he had fought in the simulation trial. He had long felt that the simulation trial was meaningless.
 He wanted a true battle!
 He glanced at his father. His Supreme Treasures were slowly emitting light. Han Jue’s aura kept increasing, making his heart palpitate.
 How strong was his father…
 Han Huang was filled with anticipation. He could see his father’s glory in the next battle.
 His father was usually gentle and was not as fierce as those Great Dao Sages. However, he knew that once he entered battle, his father would definitely be in a different state.
 He really wanted to reach the Ancient Desolate as soon as possible!
 Han Huang thought.
 At this moment, a circle of light appeared in front of him. Han Jue’s voice sounded, “We’re here.”
