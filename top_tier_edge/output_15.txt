 At this rate, if Divine Lord Peacock did not escape, he would definitely die!
 Han Jue looked up. Sweeping his Sage Sense through the 33rd Heaven, he discovered that all the Sages had gone to the Universal Hall. He was relieved.
 He flashed into the Universal Hall and all the Sages gathered. Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “Pan Xin has returned. He should be on the Heavenly Dao’s side. Previously, he had been hunted down and suppressed by Jin Shen. If he’s willing to protect the Heavenly Dao, this matter has to be resolved.” Jin Shen was the ancient Master of Calamity. The Sages discussed this matter. Han Jue only listened and didn’t say anything. He also learned about Pan Xin and Jin Shen’s past. Jin Shen was one of the Dao Ancestor’s disciples. Back then, when the Dao Ancestor first preached after attaining the Dao, Jin Shen had also participated. As the calamity increased, the Dao Ancestor conferred Jin Shen as the Master of Calamity, meaning to maintain the order of the calamity.
 The calamity also had rules. For example, after the calamity began, living beings outside the Heavenly Dao were not allowed to enter.
 Pan Xin was Pangu’s descendant. After he entered the calamity, he would not encounter Heavenly Punishment, so he always acted recklessly. Jin Shen had no choice but to take action. As time passed, the two of them formed a grudge that could not be resolved. Now that Pan Xin had risen, Jin Shen was only at the perfected Pseudo-Sage Realm. How could he be his match?
 When Pan Xin entered the Heavenly Dao, he would definitely threaten the Sages to hand over Jin Shen.
 Han Jue also learned that the reason why Jin Shen targeted Pan Xin was because of the other Sages. Pan Xin used to be fearless and didn’t even care about Sages. He often said bad things about Sages and offended them. The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate, Sect Master Tian Jue, Qiu Xilai, and Emperor Xiao had all schemed against him. After arguing for a long time, the Sages finally decided to see Pan Xin’s attitude. If he really wanted revenge, they could only hand over Jin Shen.
 Han Jue had no objections to this. If he was Pan Xin, he would also think of a way to crush Jin Shen. Otherwise, he would be unhappy. After the conversation ended, Han Jue returned to the Hundred Peak Immortal River to continue cultivating. Subconsciously glancing at Xing Hongxuan, he suddenly froze.
 Xing Hongxuan was meditating and cultivating, but she did not notice the situation in her body. Han Jue saw that the fetus was posing in the womb. Its movements slowly changed as if it was cultivating Eh?
 This posture… Han Jue widened his eyes. Wasn’t this the action of Pan Xin swinging his
 axe?
 But how did he see it?
 Even the Pseudo-Sages in the Heavenly Dao could not spy on the battle between Pan Xin and Divine Lord Peacock.
 Was this the Primordial Fiendcelestial’s talent?
 Why don’t I have it? Han Jue hesitated. No matter what, it was a good thing that his son was talented.
 In any case, this kid was still being nurtured. It was unknown when he would be born. Han Jue shook his head and continued cultivating.
 Two thousand years passed.
 Han Jue opened his eyes. He was already close to breaking through. He could break through in at most a thousand years. More than thirty thousand years had passed since his last breakthrough. Time passed really quickly. Han Jue looked over. Divine Lord Peacock had already escaped and Pan Xin was still recuperating in the Dark Forbidden Zone.
 Han Jue checked the emails and saw one.
 (Your good friend Divine Lord Peacock was attacked by your good friend Pan Xin and was severely injured.) Han Jue couldn’t help but mourn for Divine Lord Peacock.
 Ever since he met Han Jue, Divine Lord Peacock seemed to have been very unlucky.
 Could this fellow also treat Pan Xin as the Dark Forbidden Lord’s disciple?
 Amused, Han Jue immediately sent him a dream.
 In the dream.
 Divine Lord Peacock saw him and remained silent.
 Han Jue didn’t say anything. The atmosphere was awkward. After a long while… Divine Lord Peacock snorted. “What Supreme Treasure is your disciple using?” After being defeated by Pan Xin, he almost felt depressed, but he quickly blamed the defeat on the Heaven-Opening Axe. Pan Xin was not his match, but the Heaven-Opening Axe was too strong! Han Jue said, “Heaven-Opening Axe.” Divine Lord Peacock’s pupils suddenly dilated. “The Connate Supreme Treasure of Giant God Pangu?” “Mm.”
 “I see. That makes sense.”
 “Then, are you convinced?”
 1111
 Divine Lord Peacock was silent.
 He was actually not convinced. He pinched his fingers and calculated Pan Xin. He couldn’t figure it out. Now that Han Jue admitted it and even said the name of that Dharma treasure, it meant that Pan Xin was really his disciple.
 Damn it…
 Divine Lord Peacock was extremely aggrieved. He had always wanted to challenge the Dark Forbidden Lord and even brought the Karma Bead so that the other party couldn’t curse him. In the end, before he could really see the Dark Forbidden Lord, he was defeated by his disciple.
 He had been invincible in his life and was almost invincible in the same realm. In the end…
 “Above the Great Dao Sage Realm is the Great Dao Supreme Realm. Above that is the Dao Creator Realm. Do you know how insignificant the Freedom Realm is now?”.
 Divine Lord Peacock was silent as waves surged in his mind.
 He thought that a Great Dao Sage was the strongest existence! He didn’t expect there to be two levels above! He had never heard of them! Han Jue said meaningfully, “My goal is not the Heavenly Dao or the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End, but a higher level. I can’t tell you for the time being. The reason why I’m looking for you is not because of your strength, but because I like your future. One day, you will understand that all the disputes today are child’s play. When the true Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity descends, the Heavenly Dao and the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End won’t be able to take care of themselves. What Great Dao Sage? Just cannon fodder. The strongest can destroy three thousand Great Dao with a flip of their hand. Those who aren’t eternal can’t escape the Immeasurable Karma. “Those transcendent existences can turn your cognitive world into nothingness with a thought!” Han Jue’s words were extremely domineering as if he was a Dao Creator.
 Divine Lord Peacock was shocked.
 He suddenly felt very small. [Divine Lord Peacock’s favorability towards you has increased. Current favorability: 4 stars] With Divine Lord Peacock’s cultivation, how could he trust others easily? However, he couldn’t see through Han Jue. He couldn’t see through Pan Xin and the Inauspicious Divine Emperor. When all the unknown gathered together, it would produce endless reverence.
 Although Divine Lord Peacock was arrogant, he knew that he was not invincible. There was always someone better! Divine Lord Peacock took a deep breath and said, “From now on, I will acknowledge you as my master! I hope you can bring me to a higher level!” 




 Han Jue and Divine Lord Peacock chatted for a long time. After Divine Lord Peacock returned, under Han Jue’s instructions, he began to talk about what had happened when he was captured by the Inauspicious Divine Emperor. It turned out that the Inauspicious Divine Emperor did not hand him over to the Evil Heavenly Emperor at all. Instead, he used him to bargain with him.
 While the two sides were fighting, Divine Lord Peacock escaped. Divine Lord Peacock even asked if Han Jue had asked the Inauspicious Divine Emperor to let him escape on purpose. This was because the last time the Inauspicious Divine Emperor attacked, his strength was much inferior as if he was severely injured.
 Han Jue only smiled and didn’t say anything. Divine Lord Peacock was still very puzzled. Since the Evil Heavenly Emperor and the Inauspicious Divine Emperor were both working for the Dark Forbidden Lord, why were they fighting among themselves?
 Han Jue asked, “Why are the Three Pure Ones divided into three branches?” Divine Lord Peacock was silent. No matter what, Han Jue accepted Divine Lord Peacock. He let him recuperate first and contact him in the future.
 After the battle with Pan Xin, Divine Lord Peacock’s soul origin had been damaged greatly. He needed time to recuperate.
 Six hundred years later, Han Jue began to break through. It took him more than three hundred years to break through.
 Awesome!
 It had been a long time! His Dharmic powers surged! His soul was elevated! Every breakthrough was a sublimation!
 At this moment, Han Jue felt that his potential was not so mediocre after all. As he consolidated his cultivation, he checked his attributes panel.
 (Name: Han Jue]
 [Race: Primordial Fiendcelestial (Immeasurable Emperor)]
 (Cultivation: Late-stage of the Freedom Primordial Chaos Realm (Perfect Sage)]
 (Technique: Primordial Chaos Reincarnation Great Dao (Great Dao), Heavenly Cycle Body Tempering]
 [Great Dao: Great Dao of Life and Death, Great Dao of Karma, Great Dao of Extreme Origin]
 Not only did his lifespan increase, but it also doubled!
 Han Jue felt that it was a little ridiculous how his lifespan refreshed every time he broke through. Coupled with the Book of Misfortune, he was simply invincible.
 However, on second thought, he had to break through quickly.
 If it were anyone else, how could they break through so quickly? Even if he gave the Book of Misfortune to others, once they became addicted, they would be squeezed dry by the book before they could break through and refresh their lifespan. They would die of old age. Han Jue felt that he couldn’t rely on the Book of Misfortune. He had to reduce his reliance on it.
 (Your good friend Evil Heavenly Emperor was attacked by your enemy, Karma Heaven. He was severely injured.)
 (Your son Han Tuo was attacked by your enemy, Karma Heaven. He was severely injured.)
 (Your good friend Pan Xin has obtained Pangu’s inheritance. His cultivation has increased greatly.]
 (Your good friend Heavenly Calamity Emperor was cursed by a mysterious curse.)
 [Your son Han Tuo was deprived of his body by your enemy, Karma Heaven. His soul was imprisoned.]
 (Your good friend Divine Lord Peacock was attacked by an Inauspicious Evil) x78902922 (Your good friend Huang Zuntian has entered the Dark Forbidden Zone.]
 Han Jue frowned when he saw Han Tuo’s encounter.
 Karma Heaven!
 How dare you hurt the Heavenly Emperor and my
 son!
 Not only that, but you also took away my son’s body! Han Jue was worried that Karma Heaven would discover the secret of Han Tuo’s body. He immediately took out the Book of Misfortune and started cursing him. Needless to say, he would definitely be killed in one go.
 [Karma Heaven: Great Dao Divine Spirit, formed by the Great Dao of Karma. Later, it was controlled by Ancestor Xitian and was deprived of the Great Dao Origin. Therefore, it hates the Heavenly Dao. Because you stopped his plan to destroy the Heavenly Dao, it has developed hatred towards you. Current Hatred Points: 4 stars]
 Han Jue checked Karma Heaven’s information again. Not only was he helping the Heavenly Emperor and Han Tuo, but he was also helping the ancestor eliminate a great enemy! Five days later. Han Jue’s lifespan began to decrease rapidly. He opened his attributes panel and stared at his lifespan. A hundred million years! A billion years!
 Ten billion years!
 A hundred billion years! A trillion years! 10 trillion years! 100 trillion years! Han Jue continued cursing. His current lifespan was not worth mentioning in his eyes. He suddenly remembered that he had decided to use the Book of Misfortune less.
 Just this once. One last time. Using it less did not mean he would not use it. After adjusting his state of mind, Han Jue focused on cursing
 In the dark starry sky, there was a huge oil lamp. Millions of souls floated in the wick. They were imprisoned here and could not escape. Han Tuo and Yi Tian were also among them. Yi Tian said, “Brother, do you find this scene familiar?” Frustrated, Han Tuo was asked in an annoyed tone, “What do you mean?”
 “Back then, when I was suppressed by the Dark Sage King, was it very similar to now?”
 ILII
 Han Tuo couldn’t understand Yi Tian’s mind. He was still in the mood to joke. The enemy this time was different from the past. Even the Evil Heavenly Emperor was severely injured. Millions of Heavenly Troops were suppressed here and endured the burning of the lamp. It was a fate worse than death. Han Tuo couldn’t help but think of his father. He was his only hope. He said that he wanted to grow up on his own. He didn’t expect to need his father’s help again. At this moment… The dark starry sky stirred up a cold wind. The lights of the huge oil lamp swayed as the fire increased, causing many Heavenly Troops to wail. A great pressure descended. Han Tuo actually felt as if his soul was about to dissipate. What happened? Han Tuo was shocked and swept his gaze in all directions.
 Yi Tian asked carefully, “What does that fellow want?”
 Han Tuo did not answer him. The huge oil lamp had a mysterious restriction that prevented them from using their divine sense. They could only use their naked eyes to capture it. “Hmph, what a Heavenly Court. I didn’t expect you to have the backing of the Dark Forbidden Lord!”
 A cold snort sounded. Han Tuo remembered that the other party was the mysterious mighty figure who had suppressed them. Millions of Heavenly Troops were captured by the other party with a single hand. It was still a nightmare to think about such a Mystical Power.
 “Since you want to save them, I’ll devour their bodies!”
 (Because of your curse, your enemy Karma Heaven’s Dao heart has wavered.)
 [Because of your curse, your enemy Karma Heaven’s Dao heart shattered and his cultivation decreased greatly.)
 (Your enemy Karma Heaven has devoured a million living beings. His bloodline has fused with them and his providence has increased greatly.]
 Seeing the latest emails, Han Jue’s expression darkened.
 Could it be that Karma Heaven had eaten Han Tuo?
 [The mental demons of your enemy, Karma Heaven, were born because of your curse.)
 4 quadrillion years!
 (Your enemy, Karma Heaven, is affected by your curse. His mental demons are causing trouble. His bloodline is surging and his body was destroyed.]
 5 quadrillion years! Aren’t you going to die?


 “I don’t believe it. I have to kill you. Even if I can’t kill you, I have to make sure you can’t jump around anymore!” Han Jue muttered to himself. The black light of the Book of Misfortune flickered, causing his expression to change.
 He looked very cold, like an evil villain plotting behind the scenes.
 His lifespan continued to decrease rapidly!
 6 quadrillion years!
 (Your enemy, Karma Heaven, is affected by your curse. Mental demons wreak havoc and his soul is severely injured.]
 (Your enemy, Karma Heaven, perished and his soul transformed into the Great Dao of Karma.]
 Just like the Chaotic Deity and Cundi, although they were believed to have died, they were actually still alive.
 At this moment…
 The clouds in the sky churned as crimson light filled the sky. It was a spectacular and beautiful sight. Han Jue curled his lips when he saw this. What was the Heavenly Dao doing? It always mourned for the enemy! If a Sage in the Heavenly Dao died, the Heavenly Dao would not react. Han Jue had reason to suspect that the Heavenly Dao was a traitor.
 The Heavenly Dao had once given birth to a Heavenly Dao Spirit and was absorbed by Fang Liang. Han Jue suddenly wondered if the Heavenly Dao Spirit was still around. Han Jue didn’t calculate. It didn’t affect him much, anyway. Karma Heaven transformed into the Great Dao and was not a threat for the time being. Han Tuo should be able to escape or be saved by the Evil Heavenly Emperor. As for his body, if he couldn’t find it, there was nothing he could do.
 Han Jue concluded that many Great Dao actually had the same effect, but the exact performance was different. Among the new Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols, the one that left the deepest impression on him was the Spatial Absorption Fiendcelestial. It could absorb space. The stronger one’s cultivation was, the greater the space they could absorb. As long as they were strong enough, it was not impossible to absorb the entire Chaos and fuse it with themselves!
 Not only could the Spatial Absorption Fiendcelestial take away space, but it could also absorb and fuse it into its own power. Han Jue felt that if the Spatial Absorption Fiendcelestial stayed cautious like him, Pangu might not be able to defeat it. Apart from that, the Wondrous Technique Fiendcelestial, the Flesh Fiendcelestial, and the Blood Qi Fiendcelestial also interested Han Jue. After receiving a Mystical Power, the power that the Wondrous Technique Fiendcelestial could use was extremely abnormal. Han Jue felt that the Flesh Fiendcelestial was like Pan Xin, the Great Dao that represented the limit of the body. Its attack might not be powerful, but its endurance was heaven-defying.
 The Blood Qi Fiendcelestial burned its blood essence to transform into supreme Dharmic powers. At the same time, it could seize the blood essence of others. It was extremely domineering. Han Jue began the simulation trial to adapt to the new Fiendcelestial Dharma idols. He also wanted to see if the Heaven-Opening Axe, the Killing Dao Token, and the Primordial Judgment Sword could display greater power in the hands of the Dharma idols.
 Outside the 33rd Heaven.
 In the Universal Hall.
 The Sages sat side by side. Facing them were Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du and Pan Xin. Unlike the seriousness of the Sages, Pan Xin’s posture was indecent, sloppy, and rude, like a hooligan in the streets. Pan Xin, who had transformed into the size of an ordinary person, was still burly. He stood beside Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du like an iron tower. His upper body was bare, and his muscles were strong and wild. His white hair was disheveled, and his eyes were like ferocious beasts sweeping across the Sages. The Sages had unnatural expressions and were a little afraid of him.
 Shi Dudao and Li Daokong were secretly disdainful.
 He had only picked up Pangu’s providence, not cultivated it himself!
 They looked down on Pan Xin because he did not have the demeanor of an expert.
 Qiu Xilai’s face twitched, but he did not say anything. Pan Xin began to scold them one by one. The Sages who were scolded looked a little embarrassed. However, Pan Xin was indeed different from before. They didn’t dare to put on airs. Although they were undying and indestructible in the Heavenly Dao, what if Pan Xin kept killing them?
 Just like how Han Jue killed the Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage, causing him to have no choice but to escape and never dare to provoke Han Jue again. What if Pan Xin did the same to them? Pan Xin looked at Li Daokong, Shi Dudao, and Fang Liang. He thought for a moment and ignored them.
 Even Heavenly Venerate Wufa was scolded by him!
 “Don’t worry. I’m no longer the same as before. I won’t care about the past. From today onwards, I’ll protect the Heavenly Dao. I won’t participate in the battle for providence, but I only ask for one thing. I want you to ensure that the Heavenly Dao’s providence continues to increase. If the providence decreases, I’ll have to consider establishing a new Sage!” Pan Xin snorted, his face filled with arrogance.
 The Sages were silent.
 Li Daokong suddenly couldn’t take it anymore and cursed. “Stop acting arrogant. If you’re really that strong, why don’t you directly sweep through the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End and ensure the Heavenly Dao’s absolute safety?” Pan Xin glanced at him. “I’ve already swept through the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End.”
 Li Daokong chuckled.
 Seeing that the argument had affected the Hidden Sect’s Sage, Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du had no choice but to say, “Since Fellow Daoist Pan doesn’t care about the past, we’ll make peace and protect the Heavenly Dao together. After the Ancient Desolate is broken, the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End will definitely covet the Heavenly Dao even more. Fellow Daoist Pan, can you tell us about the situation in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End?”
 The Sages nodded. They were also very curious about the situation there. Pan Xin said, “The Deity Realm of the Ruins of End is indeed in chaos. Those Great Dao Sages are moving their inheritances out one after another. It’s not only the Great Dao Sages who threaten the Heavenly Dao, but also the terrifying existences in the Ancient Desolate.
 He began to talk about the Ancient Desolate. He spoke very seriously, but he looked relaxed and did not take the Ancient Desolate seriously at all.
 On the other side.
 Han Jue stayed in the simulation trial for twenty years.
 Han Jue couldn’t help but be shocked by Pan Xin’s strength. How did this fellow escape from a group of Great Dao Sages? At the thought of Pan Xin, Han Jue’s eyes lit up. He looked up. Pan Xin had indeed entered the Heavenly Dao and had even established his own Dao Field outside the 33rd Heaven.
 Pangu Hall! How pretentious. Han Jue immediately moved to the front of Pangu Hall and used the simulation trial to detect Pan Xin.
 Almost instantly, he jumped back into the Hundred Peak Immortal River. In the Pangu Hall, Pan Xin opened his eyes. He frowned and muttered, “That aura just now was a little familiar…”


 After returning to the Daoist temple, Han Jue immediately entered the simulation trial and challenged Pan Xin!
 An hour later, he began the second simulation trial.
 Just as he had guessed, Pan Xin’s strength was mainly reflected in his indestructible body. This kind of immortality was even more domineering than the revival of the Heavenly Dao.
 It was impossible to destroy his body. As for the Heaven-Opening Axe, it was too slow and couldn’t hurt Han Jue at all. If Divine Lord Peacock could dodge, so could he. Han Jue used the Primordial Divine Rage to fuse with the power of the Fiendcelestials and finally cut Pan Xin in half.
 In the end, a green lotus rose and enveloped him, blocking all the attacks. 36th-grade Chaotic Green Lotus! Not bad! Han Jue began to immerse himself in the battle with Pan Xin. A hundred years passed in the blink of an eye. Han Jue opened his eyes and heaved a sigh of relief.
 How satisfying! A confident smile appeared on his face again. He had the Stellar Primordial Body and grasped many Great Dao Mystical Powers. He held all sorts of Supreme Treasures and could always fight across realms.
 Dao.
 Not everyone was like Han Jue! He also solved his doubts. Pan Xin wasn’t powerful enough to resist a group of Great Dao Sages, but the Great Dao Sages couldn’t hurt him at all. Apart from his powerful body, he also had the 36th-grade Chaotic Green Lotus. Similarly, because of the difference in cultivation, he couldn’t hurt the Great Dao Sages.
 It was probably because they couldn’t kill after attacking for a long time that the Great Dao Sages let Pan Xin go. The battle with Pan Xin made Han Jue regain his confidence.
 Pan Xin could beat the perfected Divine Lord Peacock, and he could also beat Pan Xin. Didn’t that mean that Han Jue was already invincible in the Freedom Realm? That’s right! It was a beating! After more than ten thousand simulation trials, Han Jue could already prevent Pan Xin from hurting him at all. He couldn’t even touch the corner of his clothes. However, it was very difficult to kill Pan Xin. First, he had to think of a way to break through the strongest defense of the 36th-grade Chaotic Green Lotus.
 Cities had already been built near the Hundred Peak Immortal River. Under the operation of Li Xuan’ao and Han Zuitian, the number of in-name disciples of the Hidden Sect was increasing at a terrifying speed. With the reputation of the Immeasurable Merit Divine Might Heavenly Sage, Li Xuan’ao easily took back the three regions. The Hidden Sect was developing well! In the Immortal World, humans became more and more like the Heavenly Dao Race.
 Han Jue discovered that not only the Immortal World, but the providence of the humans in the Earth Immortal World also became stronger and stronger. Moreover, the providence of the two worlds was actually fusing. He counted with his fingers and smiled. Long Hao had improved. He wasn’t as rash as before and knew how to use his brain.
 Han Jue took a look at Han Yu. This fellow was still stuck at the Six Mystic Divine Origin. It was indeed not easy to break through to the Zenith Heaven Realm. It could block the path of 90% of the Deity Realm experts. Ever since Pan Xin returned, the providence of the Heavenly Dao had been increasing exponentially. Even the Heavenly Dao Domain was constantly expanding. How impressive. Thinking of something, Han Jue immediately checked Pan Xin’s profile picture.
 [Pan Xin: Late-stage of the Freedom Primordial Chaos Realm, Pangu’s reincarnation, one of the first living beings after creation. He has experienced the Immeasurable Calamity and was playing in the mortal world. Afraid of being discovered by the ancient Master of Calamity, he especially infiltrated the Sword Dao River. Because of your nature, he is interested in you. Current favorability: 3 stars]
 Gasp
 Late-stage of the Freedom Primordial Chaos Realm!
 Last time, he was only a Primordial Chaos Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal. Wasn’t his strength growing too quickly?
 (150 billion years will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [Detected that Pan Xin’s body contains karma that exceeds the system’s current limit. It is corroding his soul bit by bit until the reincarnation process ends.]
 Han Jue remained silent.
 He suddenly began to pity Pan Xin. In the end, you’re still a pawn! Perhaps Pan Xin did not even realize this and was still immersed in powerful joy. “How long will this process take?” (150 billion years will be deducted. Do you want to continue?] Continue!
 [Can’t deduce it accurately. With the current transformation speed of his soul, it will take at least 100 million years.]
 A hundred million years!
 Han Jue frowned.
 If Pangu descended into the Heavenly Dao, it would not be safe.
 “Pangu… Dao Ancestor… What are you guys plotting?” Han Jue fell into deep thought. These two transcendent existences were trying their best to revive. It was really strange. It seemed that the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity was not groundless. It would even involve all the supreme experts since ancient times.
 Han Jue couldn’t figure it out, so he stopped thinking about it.
 In the darkness, an old Daoist slowly walked forward. Lotus flowers bloomed under his feet and space fluctuated. It was Ancestor Xitian! Ancestor Xitian looked forward expressionlessly. After an unknown period of time, he suddenly stopped. There was still darkness ahead, and nothing could be seen. Ancestor Xitian said, “Why did you transform into the Great Dao? This isn’t your style.”
 As soon as he finished speaking, a venomous voice sounded, “Xitian, tell me the truth. Are you the Dark Forbidden Lord?”
 Dark Forbidden Lord?!
 Ancestor Xitian asked in surprise, “You were cursed by the Dark Forbidden Lord? Why did he do that? Before this, what did you do and who did you target?”
 The vicious voice sounded again, “Hmph, still pretending? I only captured people from the Heavenly Court.”
 Ancestor Xitian did not turn around or answer. He seemed old but extremely determined.



A thousand years passed. Han Jue originally wanted to enter seclusion until his 200,000th birthday, but considering that Li Xuan’ao had been waiting outside the Dao Field for a long time, he still stopped cultivating.

He moved him into the Daoist temple.

Li Xuan’ao waited for more than ten years and finally saw Han Jue. He heaved a sigh of relief.

He didn’t think too much about it. He knew that Han Jue was used to going into seclusion for a thousand years. Before the thousand years were up, even a Sage could forget about seeing him.

“Sect Master, now that the Hidden Sect…”

Li Xuan’ao began to report the situation. The number of outer disciples had already exceeded ten million. There was a threshold for the Hidden Sect to recruit disciples. They had to be at least a Grand Unity Heaven Immortal. Apart from recruiting disciples, many Sage Sects and races also took the initiative to express their goodwill.

During this period of time, many geniuses appeared among the Hidden Sect disciples outside the Hundred Peak Immortal River.


Li Xuan’ao was very excited after receiving the answer.



Although the Dark Forbidden Zone was empty, too many experts had died there over the years. This was an opportunity. In addition, there were also some secret realms and dimensional spaces hidden in the Dark Forbidden Zone. They were all things that were helpful for the development of a faction.

To Sages, such an arrangement could help the Heavenly Dao understand the chaos more effectively and even know some potential enemies in advance.

Although there were battles in the Immortal World, the overall situation was very peaceful. In such a golden age, cultivation talent was the easiest to stand out. Without battles, geniuses could grow better. Many geniuses also appeared on the Heavenly Dao Providence Board. Time passed. A thousand years later. Words appeared in front of Han Jue.

(Detected that you are already 200,000 years old and your life has taken another step forward. You have the following choices:]

(1: Leave the Heavenly Dao immediately and spread the name of the Primordial Fiendcelestial in the chaos. You can obtain a Great Dao fragment, a Heavenly Dao Spirit Stone, a Creation Spirit Stone, a chance to upgrade the Dao Field, a Mystical Power inheritance, and a Supreme Treasure.]

[2: Cultivate in a low profile manner and stay away from the chaos. You can obtain a Great Dao fragment, a Creation Spirit Stone, and a Supreme Treasure.)

As expected of a choice that could only be triggered once every hundred thousand years. The reward was still very generous. Han Jue maintained his original intention and silently chose the second option. (You chose to cultivate in a low profile manner and stay away from the chaos. You obtained a Great Dao fragment, a Creation Spirit Stone, and a Supreme Treasure.) [Congratulations on obtaining the Chaotic Supreme Treasure—Time Dao Robe) (Time Dao Robe: Defensive Chaotic Supreme Treasure. A defensive Supreme Treasure condensed from the power of time. It can defend against attacks from Great Dao existences.) Defend against the attack of Great Dao existences? Han Jue was delighted!

He liked defensive Dharma treasures the most. Pan Xin’s 36th-grade Chaotic Green Lotus made him extremely envious.


What a harvest!

Han Jue immediately took out the Time Dao Robe and prepared to make it recognize him as its master.


This method was different from other Dharma treasures, but to Han Jue, it was not difficult. After putting on the robe, Han Jue felt even more handsome.

He retracted his Freedom Divine Light and the divine light of the Sun and Moon Yin-Yang Protection, revealing his peerless appearance. In the past, he felt that the divine light all over his body was very impressive. Now, he was a little tired of it. No wonder even an existence like the ancestor had returned to his original state.

Han Jue started the simulation trial.

His opponent was still Pan Xin.

He stood and let Pan Xin slash him. After an hour, Han Jue finally felt bored. Pan Xin couldn’t break through his defense at all! Han Jue continued to challenge Ancestor Xitian. The ancestor was also unable to break through his defense, but Han Jue couldn’t kill him either. He could only say that there was a fifty-fifty chance. Han Jue experienced the feeling of Pan Xin facing a group of Great Dao Sages. It was really satisfying. Han Jue continued to change opponents. He discovered that all the experts in the simulation trial could not break through the Time Dao Robe’s defense.

Sigh.

It was so lonely to be invincible. Han Jue felt that he was too arrogant, but his opponent was only like this. He had no choice. He placed his attention on the Fiendcelestial Qi in the Primordial World and began to choose the Chaotic Fiendcelestial he was about to nurture. “If I nurture the Strength Fiendcelestial, will Pangu notice?” Han Jue asked in his mind.

[200 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]

Continue!

He was mainly asking about the Strength Fiendcelestial and not Pangu himself.

(Yes]

Han Jue immediately dismissed this thought. He couldn’t provoke Pangu for the time being! Han Jue finally decided to use the Creation Spirit Stone on the Time Fiendcelestial.


The creation process required time. Han Jue focused on Xing Hongxuan next door. Her abdomen had already swelled slightly, but she still didn’t look pregnant. That brat was still in her womb. Han Jue finally understood. The Connate Primordial Fiendcelestial was different from the Postnatal Primordial Fiendcelestial, just like the difference between the Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial and Murong Qi.

Han Jue was a Postnatal Primordial Fiendcelestial who had transformed. Han Tuo was still in the process of transformation. He looked forward to his youngest son’s talent after he was born.

To prevent any accidents, he decided to give Xing Hongxuan an Absolute Purification every few days to prevent some supernatural existences from plotting against him.
