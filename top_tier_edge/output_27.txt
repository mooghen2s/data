 Why haven’t you summoned me yet! Han Jue clenched his fists and felt a little bitter.
 The Heavenly Emperor was crazy.
 It would be fine if he was suddenly summoned. At least, he could maintain a high level of nervousness and run after insta-killing the enemy.
 Now, he had been informed in advance, causing him to be unable to cultivate in peace.
 He immediately perked up.
  It’s time!
 Han Jue directly activated all his Dharma treasures and prepared to fight at any time.
 He took a deep breath and stepped into the black vortex.
 Heavenly Court!
 In front of a palace.
 Han Tuo looked at the black vortex in front of him and could not help but be stunned.
 This technique was…
 This was the first time the Evil Heavenly Emperor had used the Invocation Technique. He was a little nervous, afraid that he would not succeed.
 Now that the Great Dao Sages were restraining them, Life couldn’t target them. They could still think of a way to avoid the power of darkness. When the Great Dao Sages were suppressed, it would be their turn next!
 A figure appeared in the black vortex and slowly stepped out.
 It was Han Jue!
 Seeing Han Jue’s peerless face, the Evil Heavenly Emperor heaved a sigh of relief.
 “Father…”
 Han Tuo looked at him excitedly. Han Jue ignored him and was frantically checking the surrounding experts.
 Heavenly Lord of Primordial Beginning, Nüwa, Di Jiang, Jie Yin, Fuxitian, Empress Houtu…
 So many familiar faces!
 Are these people ganging up on me?
 Han Jue’s heart trembled.
 Soon, he saw a message.
 [Life: Late-stage Great Dao Primordial Chaos Realm, unknown background)
 Han Jue let the system capture Life’s information.
 It was not the huge shadow with ten thousand hands but in a corner.
 Eh?
 Han Jue’s gaze landed on the Fiendcelestial Slayer.
 Ever since Life appeared, everyone’s gaze landed on Life or the surrounding dark power. No one cared about the Fiendcelestial Slayer.
 At this moment, the Fiendcelestial Slayer was meditating at the edge of the Heavenly Court to recuperate.
 Sensing Han Jue’s gaze, the Fiendcelestial Slayer subconsciously looked up.
 Their eyes met!
 The Fiendcelestial Slayer’s heart trembled.
 Who was this person?
 For some reason, when he saw Han Jue, he inexplicably panicked as if he was facing a great enemy.
 The Fiendcelestial Slayer pretended to be calm.
 Han Jue retracted his gaze and looked at Han Tuo. “Are you alright?” “It’s fine.”
 Han Tuo smiled forcefully. His soul had been severely injured and he probably had to recuperate for a period of time.
 “Master!” Zhou Fan shouted in surprise, causing Chu Shiren to turn around.
 Not only them, but the others also looked at him.
 “That’s Han Tuo’s father?” Yi Tian was stunned by Han Jue’s appearance.
 No wonder Han Tuo was so handsome…
 Qin Ling’s eyes widened as if he had seen a ghost.
 He thought he saw Grandmaster Han Yu.
 Wait, no!
 This person was even more handsome than his Grandmaster!
 Han Jue chatted with Han Tuo and the Evil Heavenly Emperor while observing the surrounding dark power.
 The power of darkness was a little like nebulous Primordial Qi…
 The Primordial World in the depths of his soul was filled with nebulous Primordial Qi that repelled the Chaotic Qi produced by the Chaotic Origin Stone. However, they belonged to him after all, so they were not offensive.
 The dark power that looked like nebulous Primordial Qi was frantically devouring the Chaotic Space!
 The power of darkness on the Fiendcelestial Slayer was the richest.
 Han Jue had to think of a way to insta-kill this fellow.
 He was deliberately letting his guard down now because he was thinking about how to attack.
 He thought of directly using the Great Dao of Void to destroy it!
 However, just the Great Dao of Void might not work. He still had to fuse with other Great Dao powers.
 Han Jue instantly thought of all the fusion plans.
 “This dark power is extremely strange. Do you have a way to disperse it?” The Evil Heavenly Emperor asked with a dark expression.
 He had underestimated Life’s strength. This power of darkness directly made the Great Dao Sage helpless. The situation was not optimistic.
 If Han Jue had no choice, he could only escape with Han Tuo.
 Han Jue frowned and said, “It’s indeed strange. I have no solutions.”
 In the distance, Fiendcelestial Slayer, who was pretending to heal his injuries, secretly heaved a sigh of relief.
 He laughed at himself. What was he thinking?
 The power of darkness was the strongest!
 How could he lose!
 At this moment!
 Han Jue suddenly appeared in front of him and placed his right hand on his shoulder.
 The three faces of the Fiendcelestial Slayer were instantly horrified. Imprisonment Great Dao!
 Great Dao of Space!
 Great Dao of Hell!
 The Fiendcelestial Slayer was imprisoned and could not move.
 Everyone was shocked and subconsciously turned around.
 Han Jue appeared in front of the Fiendcelestial Slayer.
 Did he want to avenge his son?
 Just as they had this thought, Han Jue had already fused with dozens of Fiendcelestial powers. With the Great Dao of Void as the main, surging Dharmic powers gathered on his right index finger.
 Han Jue pressed the finger on the Fiendcelestial Slayer’s forehead.
 The Fiendcelestial Slayer’s eyes widened in shock.
 Han Jue was expressionless as he directly used the Heaven Earth Mystic Yellow World Piercing Sword Finger.
 Boom
 Sword Qi erupted!
 It directly drowned the Fiendcelestial Slayer!
 Along the way, a gap was torn in the darkness, as if a white light had appeared in the night.
 Immediately after, the darkness that enveloped the Heavenly Court shattered. The power of darkness that entangled the Great Dao Sage and the Heavenly troops vanished.
 Sunlight instantly replaced the darkness!
 All the Great Dao Sages turned to look at Han Jue.
 Some were shocked, some frowned, and some rejoiced. They expressed all sorts of emotions.
 The huge shadow that symbolized Life glared at Han Jue and shouted, “How dare you!”
 A black shadow emerged from Han Jue’s body. It was as if a giant suddenly stood up and punched at the huge shadow.
 Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial!
 The domineering fist wind crushed everything!
 The arm of the ten thousand foot tall shadow turned into dust. Immediately after, the main body was crushed.
 Han Jue raised his left hand and sucked a soul into his hand.
 It was Life’s soul!
 As for the Fiendcelestial Slayer’s soul, it had already been crushed by the Heaven Earth Mystic Yellow World Piercing Sword Finger. If not for Han Jue deliberately keeping him alive, he would have already died!
 With Han Jue’s two attacks, the entire Heavenly Court instantly fell silent.
 Yi Tian’s eyes widened as he looked at the messy sky. He muttered, “It’s over just like that?”
 The Great Dao Sages were also silent and deeply shocked.
 At the same time.
 Shi Dudao, who was in the mysterious pool, clapped his hands and laughed. “I knew it! I knew it!”
 He stared at Han Jue in the light.
 You are indeed the Dark Forbidden Lord!
 Li Daokong was also very excited, but he was puzzled.
 You’re from the Hidden Sect?
 What do you know?
 “Who are you?”
 Life’s soul had the appearance of a human. It looked very ordinary and its figure was not burly.
  He stared at Han Jue in anger. He couldn’t figure out how the power of darkness could be dispersed so easily.
 Han Jue ignored him. He pinched the soul body with one hand and arrived in front of the Evil Heavenly Emperor.
 “Should I leave him to you or should I take him away?” Han Jue asked.
 This was what they had agreed on earlier. They would keep him alive and ask for more information.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor was about to speak when Life suddenly smiled sinisterly. “Do you think it’s over? I’m not the only one!
 “Come out!
 “I want them dead!
 “I want them all to die!”


 Life’s voice echoed above the dilapidated Heavenly Court, causing the hearts of the tens of millions of Heavenly troops to shiver.
 Han Jue immediately used the simulation trial to check his surroundings.
 He did not see any other Life appear.
 At this moment!
 The space behind the South-Heaven Gate suddenly shattered and a huge black hole appeared. Figures slowly stepped out.
 (Life: Late-stage Great Dao Primordial Chaos Realm, unknown background)
  [Life: Mid-stage Great Dao Primordial Chaos Realm, unknown background)
 (Life: Early-stage Great Dao Primordial Chaos Realm, unknown background)
 (Life: Late-stage Great Dao Primordial Chaos Realm, unknown background)
 Han Jue instantly detected their cultivation.
 There were a total of thirteen Lives, all with the cultivation of a Great Dao Sage!
 Han Jue frowned. He was secretly shocked. Life’s force was already so powerful?
 However, he noticed that these Lives did not carry the power of darkness. This way, the Great Dao Sages could show their ability.
 These Lives were all different. All of them wore black robes and their bodies were like souls. They were ghastly and terrifying.
 The thirteen Lives walked straight towards Han Jue’s palace, their auras rising steadily.
 Boom! Boom! Boom…
 The palaces shattered one after another. The entire space shattered and was replaced by a purple space. Endless purple mist surged. Immediately after, the purple mist turned into white light and then dark blue. It was extremely strange. This was the Primordial Space. The change in color was only because their Dharmic powers were increasing rapidly.
 The thirteen Lives had just taken five steps when twelve figures blocked their path.
 It was the twelve Ancestral Magi.
 With that, the twelve Ancestral Magi all transformed into their true forms. All of them had terrifying faces and had pythons wrapped around their waists. They were burly.
 The Heavenly Lord of Primordial Beginning waved his horsetail whisk and smiled. “It’s indeed time to attack.”
 Jie Yin, Nüwa, and the other Great Dao Sages walked forward.
 The previous power of darkness had indeed made them very aggrieved. Once their Dharmic powers were used, they were directly neutralized by the power of darkness. How could they fight?
 The Life in Han Jue’s hand shouted crazily, “Are you afraid? It’s useless even if you beg for mercy now!”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor, Han Tuo, Zhou Fan, and the others frowned.
 The thirteen Lives did not look simple. Even if the Great Dao Sages blocked their way, they could still feel the soul-stirring pressure.
 At this moment!
 Black light suddenly burst out from behind the thirteen Lives and swept through the entire Primordial Void.
 All the Great Dao Sages and the tens of millions of Heavenly troops were swept away before they could react, including Han Jue.
 Han Jue felt his vision blur and his surroundings turned dark. It was as if he had arrived at the Dark Forbidden Zone. The surrounding Evil Heavenly Emperor and the others were all gone.
 Immediately after, stars lit up in the darkness and quickly formed a starry sky.
 Han Jue saw thirteen Lives. To be precise, there were fourteen Lives!
 Behind the thirteen Lives was a black shadow that was like a ball of Qi.
 “This is my Dark Instinct. It can only be used on existences of the same realm. Only by defeating us can you escape this illusion!” a hoarse voice sounded.
 The thirteen Lives spread out and quickly surrounded him.
 Han Jue raised his eyebrows and asked, “Will the other Great Dao Sages also face your siege alone?”
 Han Jue asked, “What if I don’t submit?”
 Black shadows emerged from his body and quickly rose, forming terrifying huge shadows. They were the Grand Unity Aspect.
 “Then die!”
 “Kill!”
 The hoarse voice immediately ordered. He could sense how terrifying the Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols were. Feeling uneasy, he directly ordered.
 …
  In the Primordial Void.
 Han Tuo looked at Han Jue, who seemed to be frozen, and asked in surprise, “What happened?”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor frowned. He looked up and saw that the other Great Dao Sages were also motionless. It was not only the Great Dao Sages, but the thirteen Lives were also the same.
 The scene was extremely strange.
 The Life in Han Jue’s hand chuckled and said, “This is one of the Dark Instincts. It can pull enemies of the same realm into an independent and true illusion. Every Great Dao Sage will face the siege of Life alone until they die. Do you still want to join forces to resist Life?
 “Naive!
 “I forgot to tell you. Every Life has its own Dark Instinct!
 “You can forget about living when all the Great Dao Sages die!”
 Life laughed wildly and was extremely excited as if he could already see Han Tuo and the others kneeling down and begging for mercy.
 Zhou Fan looked unhappy and cursed. “I really want to crush him to death!”
 Life was a Great Dao Sage, but it was imprisoned in Han Jue’s hand. How could it be killed by him, a Primordial Chaos Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal? The Evil Heavenly Emperor frowned, his heart filled with worry.
 Life’s number and abilities exceeded his expectations.
 This battle was still too rash!
 Damn it…
 He even implicated Han Jue.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor looked up at Han Jue and couldn’t help but be stunned.
 Han Jue was actually smiling. He raised his head and said, “Dark Instinct? It’s indeed something!”
 The others were stunned. In the next moment, they couldn’t help but exclaim.
 “Father!”
 “Grandmaster!” “Master!”
 They couldn’t believe their eyes.
 How did Han Jue break through Life’s Dark Instinct?
 The Life in Han Jue’s hand widened its eyes and exclaimed, “Impossible! Absolutely impossible! How can you break free from this Dark Instinct?”
 Han Jue put it into his sleeve and walked towards the thirteen motionless Lives. “What’s so difficult about breaking free? I just have to kill all of you.”
 Han Jue’s words drifted into the ears of the Evil Heavenly Emperor, Han Tuo, and the others, making them dumbfounded.
 In other words, in just ten breaths of time, Han Jue had killed all thirteen Lives in the independent illusion?
 Erm…
 Even Zhou Fan and Chu Shiren, who trusted Han Jue, were shocked.
 How strong was he!
 They turned around and saw majestic black shadows rising behind Han Jue.
 Yi Tian couldn’t help but ask, “Han Tuo, isn’t that your Innate Mystical Power? So you inherited it from your father!”
 One…
 TWO…
 Four…
 Eight…
 He had only inherited one, but it was already enough to sweep through his peers. His father, Han Jue, had grasped so many Dharma Idols. How strong was he?
  Arriving in front of the thirteen Lives, Han Jue had already summoned dozens of Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols above his head. All of them leaned forward and looked down at the thirteen Lives like dozens of giants squeezed together like they were looking down at ants.
 “Impossible! How did you do it?”
 The thirteen Lives exclaimed in fear.
 As for the Life who had used his Dark Instinct, the black aura he had transformed into kept swaying as if it would be extinguished at any moment.
 Han Jue glanced at him. The dozens of Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols above him waved their fists and palms as if the sky was collapsing!
 Boom
 A terrifying light burst forth, causing all the spectators to close their eyes. Their divine sense was blocked.


 As for the thirteen Lives, they no longer existed. Not even ashes were left!
 “Who are you?” the black aura in Han Jue’s hand asked with a trembling voice.
 How could they be killed in an instant?
 Impossible!
 This person definitely far exceeded a Great Dao Sage!
  Han Jue couldn’t be bothered to say anything else. He directly used the Great Dao of Imprisonment, Confusion, and Space to suppress the black aura before putting it into his Primordial World.
 He turned around and prepared to return.
 At the same time, the other Great Dao Sages woke up.
 They looked around warily and were shocked to find that the thirteen Lives were no more.
 “Fellow Daoists, have you also been affected by Life’s Dark Instinct?”
 “That’s right, but it suddenly stopped. What happened?”
 “He retreated?”
 “That Mystical Power is too dangerous. We have to reconsider Life’s strength.”
 “How can we win against thirteen Lives alone? Fortunately, they retreated.”
 The tens of millions of Heavenly troops and their disciples looked at each other. They wanted to tell the truth, but they were afraid of offending the Great Dao Sages.
 How was this a retreat?
 All thirteen Lives were killed!
 The scene of Han Jue using dozens of Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols lingered in their minds.
 Too shocking!
 Han Jue immediately appeared in front of the Evil Heavenly Emperor and walked towards the black vortex.
 He said, “I’ll leave the rest to you.”
 At this moment!
 An extremely dangerous aura attacked from the depths of the Primordial Void. It was too fast!
 If Han Jue stepped into the black vortex directly, the other party might catch up before it could shrink.
 No!
 In a flash, Han Jue thought of countless possibilities and made the correct choice.
 He immediately summoned Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols and pounced back.
 Apart from the Great Dao Sages, no one could react in time.
 Everything happened too quickly!
 When time slowed down by a quadrillion times, one could see the confrontation between Han Jue and the mysterious attacker.
 The mighty Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols were pierced by a terrifying beam of light and destroyed on the spot.
 After piercing through fifteen Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols, the terrifying beam of light dissipated.
 Han Jue wanted to escape directly, but he suddenly thought of the Evil Heavenly Emperor, Han Tuo, Zhou Fan, Chu Shiren, and the others.
 Han Jue immediately checked his surroundings.
 [Despair Dao Spirit: Perfected Great Dao Primordial Chaos Realm, Great Dao Divine Spirit]
 It was him!
 When Han Jue attained the Great Dao back then, he wanted to step into the door of the Great Dao. At that time, the Despair Dao Spirit stopped him and threatened that he had to submit to the Chaotic Deities.
 However, this fellow was only at the perfected Great Dao Primordial Chaos Realm and not the Great Dao Supreme Realm.
 “Exalted God, what are you doing?” Jie Yin’s voice suddenly sounded.
 The voice of the Despair Dao Spirit sounded, “Hmph, this fellow violated the rules of the Great Dao. I’m here to kill him!”
 Di Jiang mocked. “Then why didn’t you eliminate Life previously? Life threatened to overturn the Chaos. Why didn’t you, a Great Dao Divine Spirit, do anything?”
 The other Great Dao Sages followed.
 “Yes, Exalted God, let’s settle this first.”
 “There’s more than one Life. They want to cause chaos. This person fought alongside us previously. We shouldn’t kill him.”
 “That’s right, Exalted God. You didn’t encounter Life when you came?”
  “Why didn’t the Great Dao Divine Spirits join forces to kill Life?”
 Han Jue was quite surprised at the Great Dao Sages’ words.
 He didn’t expect these Great Dao Sages to speak up for him!
 Good opportunity!
 Han Jue immediately entered the black vortex, and it shrank.
 Stopped by the Great Dao Sages, the Despair Dao Spirit was furious. “You want to stop the Great Dao Divine Spirit?”
 Although he didn’t appear, he could see the black vortex disappear. He was extremely unhappy.
 He missed another opportunity!
 Jie Yin said casually, “If it’s Life, you can naturally kill him. However, we still need him to resist Life together. After all, you don’t dare or have other reasons and can’t attack Life.”
 The Heavenly Lord of Primordial Beginning sneered. “I suspect that Life is the lackey of the Great Dao Divine Spirits. Especially this Despair Dao Spirit, he never maintains the order of chaos. However, if a cultivator tries to obtain the Great Dao, he will be the first to jump out.”
 His words were agreed by the other Great Dao Sages. Clearly, they had encountered the same situation as Han Jue.
 They would have endured it if it was in the past.
 They felt the danger now that the faction called Life had appeared.
 Just as they finally retreated, the Despair Dao Spirit immediately appeared.
 What did that mean?
 The Great Dao Sages instantly thought of the most terrifying possibility.
 It was this possibility that made them dare to stand out.
 The Despair Dao Spirit had already touched their bottom line!
 “How dare you? You are provoking the dignity of the Chaotic Deities!” Despair Dao Spirit’s voice sounded again, already furious to the extreme.
 Nüwa said bluntly, “Can you really represent the Chaotic Deities? They are supreme and illusory. We have never even seen them. You use them to suppress us all day. Are you really worthy of the name of the Great Dao Divine Spirit?”
 The other Great Dao Sages also cursed.
 The twelve Ancestral Magi cursed the worst.
 “Very good! Very good!”
 Despair Dao Spirit’s laughter had already turned cold.
 …
 In the mysterious pool.
 After the Lives were killed by Han Jue, the light disappeared.
 Although Li Daokong and Shi Dudao could not see the situation in the Heavenly Court, they were still discussing it.
 “All thirteen of them are dead. Do we have a chance to escape?” Li Daokong asked in a low voice.
 Shi Dudao shook his head and said meaningfully, “This is only a show. Life is still alive. Perhaps it’s just the tip of the iceberg.”
 He believed that the battle just now was just a show for Han Jue to display his might.
 One day, when the living beings of the Chaos looked forward to Han Jue resisting the Dark Forbidden Lord, that would be exciting!
 Li Daokong glanced at Shi Dudao and felt that this fellow was possessed. He had been muttering since Han Jue appeared.
 But this made sense!
 Sect Master was indeed too powerful!
 Inside the Daoist temple.
 The moment Han Jue returned, he immediately started the simulation trial and challenged the Despair Dao Spirit.
 Not only did this dog try to stop him from attaining the Dao, but he also dared to try to kill him while he was eliminating evil for the Chaos!
 He’s asking to get killed!
 Han Jue went all out at the beginning of the simulation trial.
 Ten breaths to kill the Despair Dao Spirit!
 With 549 Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols attacking together, the Despair Dao Spirit could only die!
  Han Jue continued the simulation trial, wanting to find a way to insta-kill the Despair Dao Spirit.
 After dozens of times, he finally found it.
 Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief.
 He opened the emails and frowned.
 (Your good friend Evil Heavenly Emperor was attacked by your enemy, the Despair Dao Spirit. He was severely injured.]
 [Your son Han Tuo was attacked by your enemy, the Despair Dao Spirit. He was severely injured.)
 (Your disciple Zhou Fan was attacked by your enemy, the Despair Dao Spirit. He was severely injured.)
 Killing intent surged in Han Jue’s eyes.


 “If I kill the Despair Dao Spirit now, will I attract the pursuit of the Chaotic Deities?” Han Jue asked in his mind. He was not blinded by killing intent.
 It wouldn’t be good if he attracted even more trouble for a moment of joy.
 (i quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 (No]
 Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief.
 Wait.
  Could it be that the Chaotic Deities did not care about the Despair Dao Spirit at all? Was this fellow pretending to be powerful?
 “When will I anger the Chaotic Deities?”
 (1 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 (As long as it harms the Chaos, the Chaotic Deities will attack in anger.)
 If it harms the Chaos…
 Gasp
 What did Ancestor Xitian do?
 Han Jue couldn’t help but think of Ancestor Xitian, who was suppressed by the Chaotic Consciousness. He looked quite good.
 He would deal with the Despair Dao Spirit first and deduce the ancestor’s future when he returned.
 Han Jue immediately sent a dream to the Evil Heavenly Emperor.
 In the dream.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor had just opened his eyes when Han Jue said, “Summon me!”
 The dream ended.
 In the Primordial Void, the Evil Heavenly Emperor opened his eyes and frowned.
 The living beings of the Heavenly Court and the Great Dao Tower were surrounded by a huge protective array formation. Outside the array formation, the Great Dao Sages were attacking a figure surrounded by a black aura.
 The figure was burly and his flesh could not be seen. One could vaguely see his cold armor. He wore a bronze mask that looked like a bull demon and had the sinister expression of a wolf.
 “What’s wrong?”
 Zhou Fan noticed the Evil Heavenly Emperor’s abnormality and couldn’t help but ask.
 The battle had already lasted for a period of time. Although they had the help of the Great Dao Sages, they were still injured by the aftermath.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor did not answer. He was hesitating.
 Should he summon Han Jue?
 The Despair Dao Spirit’s strength was much higher than Life. It was still at ease even when facing 23 Great Dao Sages.
 On the other side. Han Jue waited for a while, but there was no summoning.
 He thought that something had happened to the Evil Heavenly Emperor and hurriedly sent a dream to Zhou Fan to ask him to use the Invocation Technique.
 After waking up, Zhou Fan immediately used the Invocation Technique.
 Zhou Fan felt that it made sense.
 After all, the Despair Dao Spirit was a Great Dao Divine Spirit, and the Great Dao Sages were all existences that transcended all living beings. How could they be killed for no reason?
 Zhou Fan had been wandering the Chaos for a long time. Other than madmen like Life, when mighty figures fought, it often did not result in a life and death battle. The higher their cultivation level, the more they cared about his reputation. The battle ahead was also a battle of pride.
 The Despair Dao Spirit wanted to kill Han Jue but failed. He was also cursed by the Great Dao Sages and felt embarrassed.
 The Great Dao Sages had accumulated hatred for a long time. After cursing, they naturally could not give in. In the end, it was a battle of wills.
 Zhou Fan seriously suspected that after this battle, these people would return to chatting and laughing again.
 Just like the Evil Heavenly Emperor and the Great Dao Sages, hatred had accumulated in the past.
 Han Jue and the Great Dao Sages were also at odds. However, when the Great Dao Sages stood up earlier, it was as if Han Jue was their family and friends.
 After thinking it through, Zhou Fan gave up on using the Invocation Technique.
 Inside the Daoist temple.
 Han Jue frowned as he sat on the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus.
  What happened?
 None of you are summoning me?
 Han Jue felt insulted.
 He guessed that the Evil Heavenly Emperor and Zhou Fan were afraid that he couldn’t defeat the other party.
 Ridiculous!
 I finally mustered up the courage to counterattack, but you’re actually doubting me!
 Han Jue sent a dream to Han Tuo next.
 In the dream, Han Jue was extremely strict this time. “Summon me immediately. I can kill him!
 “I’ll sever ties with you if you don’t summon me in ten breaths!”
 The dream shattered.
 He was touched.  In his opinion, Han Jue was too worried about him. That was why he kept asking them to use the Invocation Technique and even threatened him with his fatherly relationship.
 Could what his father said be true?
 Han Tuo suddenly thought of this.
 Thinking about it carefully, his father’s past path was to crush everyone’s impression of him step by step.
 Han Tuo would also be doubted like this and did not want others to look down on him.
 After thinking, Han Tuo gritted his teeth and started to use the Invocation Technique.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor frowned and shouted, “What are you doing?!”
 Han Tuo gritted his teeth and said, “He said that he can kill him!”
 Then, he ignored the Evil Heavenly Emperor and continued to use the Invocation Technique.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor and Zhou Fan were stunned. The surrounding people were baffled. Only Chu Shiren understood that they were discussing the Invocation Technique.
 Chu Shiren was also full of trust in Han Jue. In his opinion, as long as Han Jue dared to do it, he would definitely succeed. He wouldn’t attack easily without full confidence.
 The black vortex appeared again behind Han Tuo.
 A figure slowly walked out of the black vortex.
 It was Han Jue!
 Seeing him, everyone felt inexplicably at ease, including the Heavenly troops and the generals of the Great Dao Tower.
 They had already witnessed Han Jue’s terrifying strength. A total of thirteen Lives were suppressed by him!
 Han Jue ignored everyone and looked at the Despair Dao Spirit.
 The Despair Dao Spirit was wrapped in the power of the Great Dao. The moment Han Jue appeared, his Great Dao power suddenly decreased.
 This was the Great Dao of Despair!
 The more despair there was around him, the stronger it became.
 Han Jue suddenly understood why the Despair Dao Spirit wanted to stop the Dao Attainer in front of the Great Dao Door. This was the fear factor buried in advance. When there was a true conflict, the fear factor would easily turn into despair, making the Despair Dao Spirit stronger in battle.
 After thinking it through, Han Jue admired the Despair Dao Spirit. It looked arrogant, but it was actually filled with schemes.
 Unfortunately, you still have to die!
 Han Jue immediately used the Grand Unity Aspect. Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols appeared above his head and quickly entered his body. They kept appearing and then entered his body, dazzling the surrounding people.
 Although the Evil Heavenly Emperor and the others didn’t understand what Han Jue was doing, those Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols were enough to make them respectful.
 Han Tuo’s eyes widened.
  He thought that Han Jue only had dozens of Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols. Now, it seemed…
 Hundreds of them!
 He was shocked.
 Yi Tian was secretly envious. Brother Han Tuo really had a good father.
 Born without parents, he had actually always yearned for kinship. It was just that he despised it.
 Soon, Han Jue fused all 549 Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols into his body. Although he couldn’t unleash 549 times the power, it was more than a hundred.
 Han Jue wanted to insta-kill the Despair Dao Spirit!
 I won’t give you a chance to despair!


 Fighting the Great Dao Sages, the Despair Dao Spirit was not in a hurry to attack when he saw Han Jue. After all, there were so many Great Dao Sages blocking him.
 Although the 23 Great Dao Sages did not gain the upper hand, he did not feel good either.
 “I have to think of a way to lure him to fight me alone.”
 Despair Dao Spirit thought silently. He raised his hand and pinched, scattering the terrifying flames that were ten million kilometers long.
 The Great Dao Sages’ battle did not look too grand. Sages could also do it, but their Dharmic powers were focused. Every Mystical Power contained thousands of changes.
 At this moment, the Despair Dao Spirit was hit by billions of illusion Mystical Powers, but he dispersed them one by one.
 It was not only an illusion, but also the power of karma, killing Mystical Powers, and even negative karma.
  While the Despair Dao Spirit was thinking of a way, the Great Dao Sages were also secretly thinking
 No matter what, the Despair Dao Spirit was still a Great Dao Divine Spirit. Behind it stood the illusory Chaotic Deities.
 The reason why they protected the Heavenly Court was that they were afraid that the Despair Dao Spirit would kill them.
 If the Despair Dao Spirit could slaughter the Heavenly Court today, it would not be strange for him to slaughter their providence sects tomorrow. Moreover, if the Heavenly Court wasn’t destroyed, the fate of escape would definitely be targeted at the Heavenly Court.
 “Divine Spirit, why are you targeting me?” Han Jue flew behind the Great Dao Sages and asked in a loud voice.
 The Despair Dao Spirit stopped, and the Great Dao Sages also stopped. Neither side wanted to fight. After all, they were not their main enemies. There was no need to fight to the death.
 Great!
 His chance was here!
 He wanted to think of a way to make the Great Dao Sages leave and give him a chance to face Han Jue alone.
 Han Jue gritted his teeth and said, “Just because of this? You won’t give me a chance to live?”
 He displayed panic, despair, and anger.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor and Zhou Fan couldn’t help but look at Han Tuo reproachfully.
 Han Tuo was stunned.
 Did I really guess wrong?
 Han Tuo’s heart instantly sank into the abyss. If his father was really killed, how would he spend the rest of his life?
 “You want to live? Alright! I’ll give you a chance. Kneel down now and swear to the Great Dao to repent for your disrespect towards the Chaotic Deities!” the Despair Dao Spirit shouted. Then, he glared at the Great Dao Sages and cursed. “Why aren’t you retreating? I’m giving him a chance. Do you really want him to die?”
 Hearing this, the Great Dao Sages fell silent. Even the Ancestral Magus Di Jiang did not speak.
 Soon, the Great Dao Sages retreated.
 They also thought that Han Jue was about to bow his head.
 Despair Dao Spirit stared at Han Jue and said, “Come here! Kneel down to me!”
 Under everyone’s gaze, if Han Jue was really willing to kneel, he didn’t mind taking him in as a slave.
 However, he had seen Han Jue use the Grand Unity Aspect just now.
 This fellow might be acting!
 So what!
 The Despair Dao Spirit was confident in himself. Han Jue had just attained the Great Dao not long ago and was not his match!
 His previous actions were probably to protect himself. Crawlers always liked to resist fearlessly.
 Han Jue pretended to be hesitant. After a while, he gritted his teeth and flew towards the Despair Dao Spirit.
 He wanted to crush Han Jue’s psychological defense in this way.
 The Great Dao Sages were expressionless and did not laugh.
 If it were them, wouldn’t they be in the same situation when facing the Despair Dao Spirit alone?
 They only felt endless sorrow.
 Han Jue was getting closer and closer to the Despair Dao Spirit.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor sighed.
 Zhou Fan and Chu Shiren turned their heads away. Han Tuo lowered his head and clenched his fists.
 The entire Primordial Void fell into absolute silence.
  I knew it!
 Despair Dao Spirit was not as arrogant and stupid as he looked.
 However, Han Jue didn’t care.
 The reason why he acted was to create an opportunity for the Despair Dao Spirit to stay!
 If he directly attacked, the terrifying aura that erupted might scare the Despair Dao Spirit away.
 The difference in cultivation was still there. If this fellow wanted to escape, Han Jue might not be able to catch up.
 The Despair Dao Spirit also felt the power in Han Jue’s body. This child was trying his best to suppress it.
 “So you’re acting and want to attack me?
 “What a joke!”
 The Despair Dao Spirit laughed wantonly as he condensed his Dharmic powers.
 The two of them had the same thought. They wanted to kill each other in one strike!
 Han Jue suddenly looked up and struck with his right palm when he was a hundred feet away!
 Primordial Divine Rage!
 After fusing with the Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols and mastering it, it formed a powerful Mystical Power that could destroy the enemy in one strike!
 Despair Dao Spirit also waved his palm. At this moment, time froze.
 “You think you can resist me?”
 The Despair Dao Spirit laughed angrily.
 Han Jue immediately mocked him. “Many people have the same thoughts as you when facing me, but you don’t even have a chance to see them!”
 Their conversation could no longer be defined by time. It was so fast that the Great Dao Sages could not capture it.
 He slapped his palms at each other, and two terrifying Dharmic powers erupted!
 A strong light burst out!
 The Primordial Void trembled violently. All the living beings felt suffocated, especially those below the Great Dao Realm. They didn’t react at all and thought that Han Jue really wanted to surrender!
 The Primordial Divine Rage that contained the power of 549 Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols carried Han Jue’s anger and directly covered the Dharmic powers of the Despair Dao Spirit.
 In an instant, the Despair Dao Spirit’s eyes widened. “Oh no!”
 “How can this be?!”
 “Why is he so powerful!”
 Many thoughts flashed through his mind. He could no longer escape!
 The Primordial Divine Rage drowned him with an extremely domineering aura!
 Killed!
 His body and soul were destroyed!
 His Great Dao soul dissipated on the spot. He couldn’t escape in time!
 The Primordial Divine Rage charged forward and created a spatial hole at the end of the Primordial Void, surging into an unknown domain.
 The strong light dissipated!
 The Great Dao Sages looked over and only saw Han Jue.
 Han Jue’s Time Dao Robe fluttered in the wind. His face was cold and his eyes were still filled with killing intent.
 The might of the Primordial Divine Rage was still there, causing the Great Dao Sages to shiver.
 Despair Dao Spirit was dead?
 Almost at the same time, the Great Dao Sages’ eyes widened and they trembled.
 The disciples they brought, the immortals of the Heavenly Court, and the cultivators of the Great Dao Tower also came back to their senses. They couldn’t believe their eyes.
  “Oh my god!” Yi Tian cursed. He was so excited that his face turned red.
 The danger had been reversed?
 He suddenly wanted to kneel down to Han
 Jue!
 Han Jue turned around and swept his gaze across the Great Dao Sages. His cold gaze made their Dao hearts beat wildly.
 Just one look!
 With a glance, Han Jue immediately came in front of Han Tuo and brushed past him. He patted his shoulder and stepped into the black vortex.
 After the black vortex disappeared, the Primordial Void remained silent for a long time.
