 The disciples of the Jie School were naturally furious as they faced the unruly Azure Heaven Mystic. They took out their Dharma treasures and cast spells at him.
 “Good timing! I’ll let you see what invincible means today!”
 Azure Heaven Mystic laughed wildly. The vertical eye between his eyebrows opened. Shadows of divine light flew out from it at an extremely fast speed, passing through the bodies of the Jie School disciples.
 In an instant, the entire sky was filled with divine light shadows. The posture of each shadow was different, as if different moves were being disassembled.
 The Jie School disciples couldn’t move. Their eyes widened in disbelief.
 Azure Heaven Mystic smiled disdainfully and left.
 He had just descended from the clouds when a blood mist bloomed above his head. Screams sounded.
 …
 In the Daoist temple of the third Dao Field.
  Han Jue slowly opened his eyes. A hundred thousand years had passed.
 Han Jue couldn’t help but think of the Ninth Chaos.
 Could the Chaos he was in be the Ninth Chaos’ soul?
 That would be too terrifying.
 Han Jue could control every corner of the Primordial World and could even use his will to control space and other rules. He could even use the Primordial World to kill it with a thought if a Fiendcelestial wanted to harm him.
 He had absolute control over his world.
 “I can’t rashly offend the Ninth Chaos or destroy it unless I reach the Creator Lord Realm.”
 Han Jue thought silently and checked the emails.
 (Your disciple Dao Sovereign was attacked by a Dao Devil) x8921092
 (Your disciple…)
 [Your good friend Evil Heavenly Emperor was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure and was severely injured.]
 (Your good friend Huang Zuntian has entered the bottom of the Chaos.]
 (Your disciple Zhou Fan was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure and was severely injured.)
 (Your good friend Divine Lord Peacock has entered the Ancient Desolate.]
 (Your good friend Divine Lord Peacock was cursed by a mysterious curse. His will is trapped.]
 To be honest, Han Jue liked the Ultimate God of Punishment. The Chaos could be peaceful for longer with him around.
 He wouldn’t touch the Ultimate God of Punishment and continue to let him be the leader of the Divine Spirits even if Han Jue surpassed the Dao Creator Realm if peace could really last.
 Han Jue inexplicably felt that the Ultimate God of Punishment would fail.
 Sigh!
 He couldn’t care less!
 Han Jue continued to read the emails.
 Divine Lord Peacock had run to the Ancient Desolate. Why?
 Han Jue remembered it.
 After reading all the emails, his will jumped to the Chaos. Looking down at the Chaos, his gaze landed on the Ancient Desolate.
 From a macro point of view, the Ancient Desolate was not far from the Heavenly Dao. They were both domains under the Divine Robe Daoist.
 The Ancient Desolate was very mysterious. It was one of the places in the Chaos that could not be spied on.
 Han Jue carefully observed the Ancient Desolate, wanting to see through it.
 The Ancient Desolate seemed to be enveloped by a black mist. A tail could be vaguely seen churning, but it also seemed like an illusion.
 “There’s something in the Ancient Desolate that can actually trap the will of a Great Dao Sage. It’s at least a Great Dao Supreme, right?” Han Jue thought silently.
 It couldn’t hide the prying of a Great Dao Supreme if there was no Great Dao Supreme.
 Han Jue’s will retreated to his body after observing for a while.
 He teleported into the Hundred Peak Immortal River and arrived at the third Dao Field. With a wave of his right hand, he brought Su Qi, Ji Xianshen, Long Hao, Li Xuan’ao, Han Yu, Qin Ling, Fang Liang, and Yang Tiandong into the Daoist temple.
 The Sages opened their eyes and hurriedly knelt when they saw Han Jue.
 They were shocked.
 They knew that Han Jue was very strong, far stronger than them, but they didn’t expect to be caught off guard and moved into his Daoist temple. This was too exaggerated. Han Jue said, “I’ll teach you a Mystical Power today. This is a Mystical Power I created for the Hidden Sect. It can’t be taught to others or your disciples. I’ll cripple you if you spread
 it.”
 The Sages promised solemnly.
 They were looking forward to it. For him to preach so solemnly, it must be an impressive Mystical Power.
 Han Jue began to preach.
 The Sages woke up a hundred years later, and they had already returned to their respective Dao Field. They recalled the Divine Might Great Heaven Palm with shock.
 What a domineering Mystical Power!
 Their hearts burned with reverence for Han Jue.
 On the other side, in the main Dao Field.
 Han Jue didn’t leave. He looked at the Immortal World next.
 After a hundred thousand years, Azure Heaven Mystic was already a Pseudo-Sage, but he had yet to attain the Dao.
 Han Jue was different. He had always cultivated in the Dao Field in the past and all his resources depended on the system. The Heavenly Dao’s providence he received was directly suppressed in the Primordial World.
 Dao Sovereign, Zhou Fan, and the others left the Heavenly Dao to search for opportunities alone and use their strength to attain the Dao.
 Azure Heaven Mystic also wanted to leave the Heavenly Dao, but the Sages did not let him. This fellow was too talented and could not be abducted by other worlds.
 He had been persuaded several times, but he could only wait.
 It would take time no matter how fast the new Sage position appeared. Azure Heaven Mystic couldn’t wait anymore.
 Han Jue happened to see Azure Heaven Mystic changing his identity and heading to Chaotic City, wanting to leave through the Chaotic Heavenly Road.
 As a Pseudo-Sage, Azure Heaven Mystic’s transformation technique was very powerful. Only Sages could see through it. As it happened, Sages were staring at him at this moment.
 The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate stopped him and brought him to his Dao Field. He chatted with him warmly and discussed the Dao with him to stall for time.
 It wasn’t good for him to slap a smiling face. Azure Heaven Mystic could only force himself to discuss the Dao.
 Han Jue almost laughed upon seeing this scene.
 
 “Looks like these guys want him to participate in the Chaotic Assembly.”
 Han Jue thought silently. He had no intention of taking in another disciple. This fellow’s karma was too great, so great that he didn’t dare to tell the Sages about this.
 However, he couldn’t let Azure Heaven Mystic dominate the Chaotic Assembly.
 In that case, wouldn’t it be falling into the Chaotic Consciousness’ trap?
 Han Jue couldn’t directly contact Azure Heaven Mystic before reaching the level of Dao Creator.
 So, he thought of another way.
 He wanted Jiang Jueshi to step on Azure Heaven Mystic to ascend!
 Jiang Jueshi was far from a hundred million years old in this life. He was young enough to participate in the Chaotic Assembly!
 Han Jue returned to the third Dao Field and visited Jiang Jueshi in his dreams.


 In the dream.
 Jiang Jueshi opened his eyes and saw Han Jue, who was shining with divine light. He immediately bowed.
 He had been looking forward to the next lecture ever since the last one.
 The Great Dao of Extreme Origin was too exquisite, finally allowing him to see the hope of attaining the Great Dao.
 Han Jue said, “Your cultivation has been good recently.”
 Jiang Jueshi said humbly, “Thank you for your lecture, Senior.”
 Han Jue asked, “What’s your cultivation goal?”
 Jiang Jueshi was stunned.
 “All living beings have spirits. With spirits, they have hearts. With hearts, they have motives and expectations. Their hearts will have motives in advance before doing anything. You’re still cultivating now. What do you want?” Han Jue asked casually. These words struck Jiang Jueshi’s heart.
  He said, “I want to reach the highest realm of cultivation. I want to revive an old friend.”
 Jiang Jueshi’s eyes lit up.
 He hurriedly asked about the Chaotic Assembly.
 Han Jue told the truth. Jiang Jueshi’s blood boiled after learning the details.

 This was an unprecedented gathering of geniuses. As expected of the Chaotic Assembly!
 Jiang Jueshi would definitely hesitate if it was the previous him. After all, he didn’t have a backing. He would most likely attract calamity if he stood out. However, it was different now. This senior could be his backing!
 “Senior, I…”
 Jiang Jueshi hesitated. There were some things he had never said and was embarrassed about.
 Han Jue asked, “Are you willing to acknowledge me as your master?”
 Jiang Jueshi secretly heaved a sigh of relief. Be it in the Heavenly Dao or the Chaos, there was no relationship more stable than master and disciple. It even surpassed that of father and son. Father and son were only karma from birth. Master and disciple formed karma from pursuing the Dao.
 Jiang Jueshi immediately knelt and kowtowed. “Greetings, Master.”
 Everything happened smoothly. Han Jue received his favorability.
 Han Jue said, “Since you’re my disciple, I’ll teach you a Mystical Power. This Mystical Power is enough to let you dominate the Chaos.”
 Jiang Jueshi was pleasantly surprised and hurriedly thanked him.
 Han Jue began to preach the Dao, naturally teaching the Divine Might Great Heaven Palm.
 The lecture ended a hundred years later.
 Jiang Jueshi opened his eyes and smiled.
 Liu Bei seemed to sense something. He opened his eyes and saw his smile. He couldn’t help but ask, “What’s wrong?”
 “I’ve acknowledged that senior as my master,” Jiang Jueshi said softly. He was extremely excited.
 What a domineering Divine Might Great Heaven Palm!
 Destroy everything! Simple and fierce. They could skip all the fancy Mystical Powers if they cultivate it to the extreme. No matter how many Mystical Powers one had, they would destroy them with a palm!
 Jiang Jueshi was even more respectful towards Han Jue.
 Liu Bei smiled. “Congratulations.”
 Jiang Jueshi smiled. “We’re fellow disciples from now on? Senior!”
 Liu Bei shook his head. “We’re considered fellow sect members, but not fellow disciples.”
 “Why?”
 “To be honest, I’m actually this senior’s clone. He’s the main body. In terms of seniority, I’m also a generation older than
 you.”
 “Clone?”
 Liu Bei was secretly pleased. He had endured for a long time and could finally posture.
 Jiang Jueshi sighed. “I see. It’s all because of Master’s favor.”
 He was still very touched when he thought about it. In order to accept him, his master had first given him a favor and only accepted him after he was willing to acknowledge him as his master. Such magnanimity was admirable.
 He couldn’t help but ask, “Who is my
 master?”
 Liu Bei was silent. At this moment, Han Jue’s voice entered his ears, allowing him to reveal his identity.
 “Heavenly Dao, Divine Might Heavenly Sage. Have you heard of him?”
 Jiang Jueshi was moved.
 Divine Might Heavenly Sage!
 This name was like thunder!
 Especially to the Heavenly Dao lifeforms, it was even more of a legend!
 He recalled something else.
 One of the initiators of the Chaotic Assembly was the Divine Might Heavenly Sage!
 His heart burned.
 In other words, he could freely display his talent in the Chaotic Assembly and not be afraid of being plotted against!
 Who would dare to hurt him in the endless Chaos with the Divine Might Heavenly Sage protecting him?
 Jiang Jueshi was touched. He had felt that his potential was enough to match his master, but his master was the Divine Might Heavenly Sage, so it was different.
 This was the strongest person in the Chaos!
 At least, that was what most cultivators thought!
 How could such an expert lack prodigies as disciples?
 Jiang Jueshi took a deep breath and his eyes became firm.
 He couldn’t embarrass the Divine Might Heavenly Sage!
 He still had to try his best to fight for the Eternal Peak of the Chaos!
 Time passed quickly.
 Hundreds of thousands of years later. [Detected that you are six million years old and your life has taken a step forward. You have the following choices:)
 (1: Exit seclusion immediately and open the Primordial Chaos in the Chaos. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment, a Primordial Fragment, and a Creation Spirit Stone.)
 [2: Cultivate in a low-profile manner and stay away from trouble. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment, a Primordial Fragment, and a Creation Spirit Stone.)
 Han Jue opened his eyes. There was no difference in the reward this time. His heart wouldn’t ache no matter the choice he made.
 He immediately chose the second option.
 He now had eight Primordial Fragments!
 In other words, he would be able to perform a Primordial Chaos Great Creation in a million years!
 Han Jue was excited. Son! You’re about to be born!
 Han Jue suddenly thought that his son might still have a chance to participate in the Chaotic Assembly.
 No one had seen a true Primordial Fiendcelestial other than Han Jue in this world. He might not be exposed as long as his son was not arrogant.
 Forget it, he would see in the future. Anyway, Han Jue had a safe card to play with Jiang Jueshi around.
 He took out the Creation Spirit Stone and fused it with a ball of Fiendcelestial Qi before continuing to cultivate.
 He prepared to break through in the next million years. A million years wouldn’t be long as long as he entered seclusion for a long time.
 
 Time passed quickly!
 Under the blue sky.
 On the stone platform.
 The five Divine Punishers stood in front of the Ultimate God of Punishment. Han Tuo reported the information about the Ancient Desolate.
 After he finished speaking, the Ultimate God of Punishment asked casually, “In other words, there’s an existence that surpasses the Great Dao Sage Realm hidden in the Ancient Desolate, and you don’t know his identity?”
 The Ultimate God of Punishment fell into deep thought.
 Yi Tian said, “Exalted God, don’t ask us to go to the Ancient Desolate anymore. That place is even more terrifying than the bottom of the Chaos. There are too many Dao Devils.”
 The Ultimate God of Punishment frowned and asked, “Dao Devils?”
 Yi Tian nodded. “It feels like the Ancient Desolate has more living beings than the Heavenly Dao. Damn it, I don’t know where they came from!”


 The Ultimate God of Punishment thought for a moment and said, “That’s all. All of you can go and prepare for the Chaotic Assembly. Someone must definitely enter the Chaotic Ten Absolutes at this meeting, understand?”
 The five Divine Punishers bowed.
 The Ultimate God of Punishment waved his sleeve, and the five Divine Punishers immediately retreated.
 The Ultimate God’s face turned cold after they left.
 He closed his eyes and continued cultivating.
 The thing he was most concerned about now was still the Chaotic Assembly. This event had to be done well. This would be the first step to changing the Chaos. The five Divine Punishers were only for supervision. He still had to make a huge move if he wanted to truly change the Chaos.
 …
 The Foolish Sword Sage and Sect Master Tian Jue stared at Azure Heaven Mystic.
 Azure Heaven Mystic became a Heavenly Dao Sage hundreds of thousands of years ago. After that, he was like a wild horse that had lost its reins. He couldn’t stop and cultivated crazily. Now, he had already reached the late-stage Primordial Chaos Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm.
 At this moment, Azure Heaven Mystic was breaking through to the perfected realm.
 Sect Master Tian Jue sighed. “The younger generation will surpass us in time. The Heavenly Dao will definitely achieve something in the Chaotic Assembly.”

 The Foolish Sword Sage said, “This kid’s potential is indeed impressive. It’s not difficult for him to enter the Chaotic Ten Absolutes. As for the Eternal Peak of the Chaotic Era, it’s hard to say.”
 Sect Master Tian Jue asked in surprise, “The Heavenly Dao is the most enlightened in the Chaos. It’s rare for geniuses in the Chaos to have an environment as blessed as the Heavenly Dao.”
 Sect Master Tian Jue was silent.
 “Although I often brag about my talent, I’ve encountered many existences who are more outstanding than me on my path of growth. It’s just that they died young, and I survived. It’s easier for geniuses to grow now that the Chaos is peaceful. Perhaps an existence that can shock the world will emerge. Azure Heaven Mystic is one of them, but it’s hard to say that he’s the most outstanding.”
 The Foolish Sword Sage sighed. There was something he did not say.
 For example, the Divine Might Heavenly Sage!
 The Foolish Sword Sage would never forget the scene of Han Jue killing twenty thousand Divine Authority Generals with a single strike!
 The Foolish Sword Sage nodded.
 Azure Heaven Mystic was still in the midst of an epiphany and did not hear their conversation.
 Even in the midst of breaking through, Azure Heaven Mystic still had a proud expression and was in high spirits.
 This was only a start. Not only the Heavenly Dao, but the entire Chaos had begun to prepare for the Chaotic Assembly.
 In the mysterious world.
 Mist filled the air.
 Divine Lord Peacock sat in front of a stone tablet. Mountains could be seen in all directions.
 They were like giant demons under the cover of the fog.
 At this moment, Divine Lord Peacock slowly opened his eyes and said, “Old thing, how long are you going to imprison me? Let me tell you, I have a backer!”
 His gaze landed on the stone tablet in front of him. This stone tablet was like dead wood. It was bleeding and looked terrifying.
 No one answered him.
 Divine Lord Peacock was angry, but he couldn’t move and could only give up.
 He had thought of asking the Dark Forbidden Lord for help again, but he did not dare when he thought of how the Dark Forbidden Lord was already very disappointed in him.
Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates The Dark Forbidden Lord wanted him to cultivate well. In order to contribute and be in danger, he had to trouble the Dark Forbidden Lord…
 He suddenly realized that it was not unreasonable for him to waste his life. Previously, he had been stuck before the Great Dao Realm. His potential was strong, but he had wasted too much time.
 The more Divine Lord Peacock thought about it, the more depressed he became.
 He was really useless.
 No!
 I can’t do this!
 Divine Lord Peacock adjusted his state of mind. His gaze became firm when he opened his eyes again.
 Time passed.
 Universe of stars, Third Dao Field.
 Under the old tree.
 Han Qing’er stretched lazily and opened her eyes. “Mother, how many years has it been?”
 Qingluan’er opened her eyes and said, “You’ve been in seclusion for almost a hundred thousand years, right?”
 Han Qing’er shook her head. “I’m asking how long Father has been in seclusion.”
 She had never left the temple ever since Han Jue taught her the Divine Might Great Heaven Palm. She would have been worried if not for the fact that she had seen him several times.
 “I don’t know, either. It might have been a million years.” Qingluan’er shook her head.
 She had already attained the Primordial Chaos Dao Fruit after so many years. As time passed, she became used to such a cultivation life.
 She could understand Han Jue now. Time really lost its meaning after reaching the Sage Realm.
 Han Qing’er muttered, “What happened this time? Father used to be in seclusion for a hundred thousand years. Why didn’t he exit seclusion after so long? Did something happen?”
 Qingluan’er asked nervously, “What did your father tell you?”
 “No, I’m just guessing. Don’t worry, Mother. Nothing will happen to Father. I’m talking about what happened. My father is so powerful, he’ll definitely be fine. I’m just curious why he’s in seclusion for so long. Perhaps he’s about to break through?”
 Han Qing’er consoled her. She knew her father’s identity. He was the strongest in the Chaos.
 Qingluan’er could only relax.
 The mother and daughter quickly entered cultivation again.
 At the same time, in the Daoist temple.
 Han Jue was still immersed in cultivation.
 He had never been in seclusion for so long. The Primordial World had already expanded several times. Embryonic figures had already formed in the Fiendcelestial Qi.
 
 At this rate, Han Jue wouldn’t need Creation Spirit Stones in the future to create Fiendcelestials anymore.
 The Chaotic Fiendcelestial transformed from the Creation Spirit Stone obtained on his six millionth birthday was still in the Primordial World.
 Han Jue slowly opened his eyes.
 His cultivation level had increased greatly, but there was still time to break through.
 He discovered that only 800,000 years had passed. He was still a distance away from his seven millionth birthday.
 He was really fighting for his son.
 He checked his interpersonal relationships. His friends were still around, which meant that they were fine.
 He continued to cultivate in seclusion and waited for the seven millionth birthday.
 The system displayed his origin lifespan. It was useless even if he used the rules of time to speed up the time in the Daoist temple. Therefore, he could only endure it.


 Ten thousand years was a long time for most cultivators, but not for Han Jue.
 Time passed quickly.
 Three lines of words suddenly appeared in front of him.
 [Detected that you are 7 million years old and your life has taken another step forward. You have the following choices:]
 (1: Exit seclusion immediately and head to the blank domain outside the Chaos to open the Primordial Chaos. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment, a Primordial Fragment, a Creation Spirit Stone, and a Heavenly Dao Spirit Stone.)
 [2: Cultivate in a low-profile manner and stay away from trouble. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment, a Primordial Fragment, and a Creation Spirit Stone.)
 Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief.
 He had been worried that the system would stop him and deliberately not give him the Primordial Fragment. Fortunately, he had been overthinking.

 There were no living beings in the blank domain. It was equivalent to death.
 Han Jue was worried that the Dao Creators were hiding in the blank domain, so he still didn’t dare to go there.
 “Will the Dao Creators notice if I go to the blank domain to create the Primordial Chaos?”
 (1 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 (Yes]
 Han Jue immediately chose the second option.
 He first took out the Creation Spirit Stone and fused it with a ball of Fiendcelestial Qi. Then, he teleported to the second Dao Field and released the Chaotic Fiendcelestial he had created previously and called Murong Qi to receive him.
 “Master, you’re finally here. I thought you had forgotten about us.”
 Dao Comprehension Sword curled her lips and pretended to be aggrieved after Murong Qi left.
 Han Jue patted her head and smiled. “How can that be? I’m just busy cultivating. As for you, why is the difference between you and Li Yao getting greater and greater?”
 Han Jue’s gaze landed on Li Yao. She was sitting on a mat and staring at him.
 Perhaps it was his imagination, but he felt a hint of gentleness in Li Yao’s eyes.
 Han Jue chatted with them for a while before quickly returning to the main Dao Field.
 Nothing else mattered. The most important thing now was to increase his bloodline!
 He sat on the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus and took out nine Primordial Fragments.
 The nine Primordial Fragments circled in the air like Great Dao Fragments and began to fuse on their own. Purple light flickered, causing the light and darkness in the temple to change.
 Han Jue waited nervously.
 Whoosh!
 A slight explosion sounded. The nine Primordial Fragments fused into one and collided between Han Jue’s eyebrows.
 In an instant, his consciousness arrived in a purple space. Endless nebulous Primordial Qi filled the surroundings.
 (Please choose the Primordial Chaos Great Creation you want.]
 This line of words appeared in front of Han Jue. It asked him to choose, but there was no choice given.
 No choice was the best choice!
 “I want my bloodline to evolve!”
 A line of words appeared in front of him.
 (Your bloodline is the Stellar Primordial Body. You are a Primordial Fiendcelestial and will evolve into an unknown bloodline. Do you want to continue?]
  There might be danger since it was the unknown?
 Han Jue asked in his mind, “Will I suffer a backlash?”
 (The Primordial Chaos Great Creation is the supreme power of creation. There will be no side effects.)
 “Then continue!”
 Han Jue was filled with anticipation.
 The moment he made a decision, the surrounding purple space suddenly shrank. He felt his will explode and his consciousness fell into chaos.
 It was like a dream. Han Jue dreamed that he was born and moved forward in a confusing place. There was no beginning or end. In the dream, he kept moving forward and never stopped.
 At the same time.
 The ground of the third Dao Field shook violently. A torrent of Spirit Qi entered Han Jue’s body. Not only the third Dao Field, but the Spirit Qi and Connate Qi of the main Dao Field and the second Dao Field were also all extracted and poured into his body.
 In the universe of stars.
 Countless stars trembled, startling Jiang Jueshi and Liu Bei, who were cultivating.
 “What’s going on? Are there enemies?” Jiang Jueshi asked in a low voice, but his Sage Sense could not capture any other aura.
 Jiang Jueshi asked in surprise, “He’s already the strongest in the Chaos. He can still break through?”
 “Why do you think he accepted you? Is it really because of your talent? No, he just admires your cultivation attitude. Like him, you spent most of your life cultivating and seldom went out to adventure. It felt like seeing his other self when he saw you. Do you get it?” Liu Bei said seriously.
 Jiang Jueshi was enlightened and felt deep veneration for Han Jue.
 He asked himself, Could I still cultivate diligently if I was the strongest in the Chaos?
 Heavenly Dao, 33rd Heaven. The Sages gathered in the Universal Hall.
 Divine Might Buddha asked anxiously, “What’s going on? The Spirit Qi of the entire Heavenly Dao is being absorbed!”
 The other Sages also said that it was not only Spirit Qi. Even the rules of the Heavenly Dao and the River of Destiny were fluctuating, as if they would collapse at any moment.
 Divine Might Heavenly Sage!
 The Sages instantly quietened down, and the worry in their hearts vanished.
 Long Hao smiled proudly. “My master must be breaking through or creating a Mystical Power. No matter what, the stronger my master is, the safer the Heavenly Dao will be.”
 The Sages nodded.
 They would definitely suspect the Divine Might Heavenly Sage’s ambitions if it was in the past. However, it was too easy for him to take control after so many tribulations. However, he had never taken the initiative to dominate. Although there were many geniuses of the Hidden Sect in the Sage circle, these geniuses were indeed powerful. The Divine Might Heavenly Sage did not say that he had to join the Hidden Sect to attain the Dao.
 Compared to the Heavenly Dao ruled by the Dao Ancestor in the past, the current Heavenly Dao was too free for Sages.
 There were no rules, and it was not so obvious to scheme. The Sages had to work hard for the Heavenly Dao’s development.
 Azure Heaven Mystic couldn’t help but ask, “What is Divine Might Heavenly Sage’s realm? Great Dao Sage?”
 The old-school Sages laughed.
  Azure Heaven Mystic was offended and said angrily, “I’m a new Sage. You don’t let me go to the Chaos, so I naturally don’t understand!”
 The Foolish Sword Sage said, “I’m an existence that surpasses the Great Dao Sage Realm, and the Divine Might Heavenly Sage can easily kill me. What realm do you think he is at?”
 Azure Heaven Mystic was stunned.
 He wasn’t the only one. The other Sages were also shocked.
 This was the first time the Foolish Sword Sage had revealed his cultivation level.
 Surpassing the Great Dao Sage Realm!
 Previously, the Sages had always thought that the Divine Might Heavenly Sage, the Foolish Sword Sage, Red Fate, and Great Sage Void Soul were all Great Dao Sages and that there was just a difference in strength between them. They didn’t expect that there was a realm above the Great Dao Sage Realm!
 On the other side.
 In the Daoist temple of the third Dao Field.
 Han Jue slowly opened his eyes. The universe of stars and the Heavenly Dao returned to normal.
 At this moment, his entire body emitted a dense purple light. His eyes were cold and his black hair fluttered, making him look otherworldly.


 In the purple light.
 Han Jue slowly looked up. He could feel his transformation.
 His body was sublimating. An unprecedented power was tempering his muscles and bones. The Primordial World in the depths of his soul expanded crazily and was unstoppable.
 Gradually, Han Jue’s skin turned purple. His black hair lost its color, and only wisps of white light swayed. His eyes became strange, like two universes with stars.
 Han Jue felt the changes in his body. He was extremely happy and didn’t feel any pain.
 This was an extreme experience. It was unprecedentedly wonderful, surpassing all joy.
 His will jumped above the Chaos and stood higher than before, looking down at the entire Chaos.
 The Chaos became tiny. At first glance, the Chaos was surrounded by endless blankness. It was like an ink dot on a piece of white paper, and this white paper was endless.
 At this moment, the black dot in the chaos began to change. It quickly expanded as if time had accelerated.

 When the Chaos reached a certain size, it suddenly shattered and transformed into countless purple fragments that spread throughout the blank domain. These purple fragments scattered like purple mist and quickly burned through the entire blank domain.
 Could this be the Primordial Chaos?
 Was everything just a manifestation of space-time reversal?
 After the purple mist filled the blank domain, the entire Primordial Chaos began to shrink. Even the blank domain no longer existed. Soon, the Primordial Chaos was as big as before it shrank into chaos, like a drop of purple ink, and the surroundings were absolute darkness.
 Nothingness.
 How was the Primordial Chaos born?
 This thought appeared in Han Jue’s mind, and he began to look forward to the next change.
 The Primordial Chaos was still shrinking. After a long time, it finally stopped shrinking, but Han Jue was shocked.
 The Primordial Chaos was actually formed by a human head!
 It was a hairless purple head with nine eyes. Its eyes were empty and it had no nose or mouth.
 What was that?
 Han Jue was curious.
 Then, everything in front of him shattered.
 His consciousness returned to reality.
 His physical transformation ended.
 (Your Stellar Primordial Body has been upgraded to the Extreme Dao Ultimate Origin Body.)
 Extreme Dao Ultimate Origin Body?
 Above the Primordial Chaos was the Ultimate Origin!
 Han Jue was secretly puzzled. Wasn’t this a brand new physique? Why couldn’t he name it personally?
 “I want to know if there was an Ultimate Origin Fiendcelestial in the past?” Han Jue asked in his mind.
 [No, it has never appeared. It’s just that an existence has raised a hypothesis regarding it. The system evolved and created the physique based on this hypothesis, so it’s called the Ultimate Origin Fiendcelestial.]
 “Who made the hypothesis?”
 (The previous Primordial Fiendcelestial.]
 Han Jue was enlightened.
 The previous Primordial Fiendcelestial had also wanted to break through the limits, but its Mystical Power was no match for fate and it still failed.
 wer was no
 From the looks of it, the system was related to the previous Primordial Fiendcelestial.
 “Could the system be created by the previous Primordial Fiendcelestial?” Han Jue continued to ask in his mind.
 [No]
 No?
 How deep was the system’s background?
 Han Jue could only suppress his confusion. He couldn’t ask the system, anyway.
 His body was condensed from the power of the final essence and had already exceeded the definition of the body. His soul was no longer single. He discovered that he could easily create countless souls that could be controlled by his will.
  The Primordial World in the depths of his soul was a hundred times larger than before. It was contained in the depths of his will and not his soul space.
 The purple light on Han Jue’s body began to change and finally turned into a red light. The red light shrank and he quickly returned to his original appearance. However, strange red patterns appeared on his forehead. His pupils were bright red and his white hair fell off. A shrunken sea of stars appeared above his head. It was actually the miniature version of the Primordial World.
 Eh?
 Bald?
 I became a Buddha?
 Han Jue didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. With a thought, black hair grew out of his head and the red patterns on his forehead faded. Only the color of his pupils couldn’t change. His eyes could release the Ultimate Origin Power. His strength would decrease greatly once he closed his eyes. He naturally wouldn’t hide them in order to maintain his peak state.
 Just like that, Han Jue looked no different from before, but his pupils had changed color.
 Excited, he entered the simulation trial and started the challenge.
 25,000 Great Dao Supreme Realm Foolish Sword Sages!
 Instant kill!
 Thirty thousand, insta-kill!
 Thirty thousand, insta-kill!
 Fifty thousand, insta-kill!
 Han Jue kept increasing the number of Foolish Sword Sages. He used the Divine Might Great Heaven Palm to activate the Ultimate Origin Power and directly destroyed all enemies!
 Eighty thousand Foolish Sword Sages were insta-killed!
 A hundred thousand Foolish Sword Sages were insta-killed!
 Awesome!
 Han Jue was filled with heroism. He used his full strength every time he waved his palm. It was satisfying, and the endless power of ultimate essence crushed everything!
 A hundred thousand Foolish Sword Sages was not the limit!
 Han Jue wanted to continue, but he felt something and suddenly stood up, teleporting to the main Dao Field.
 He followed Xing Hongxuan to her Daoist temple.
 At this moment.
 Xing Hongxuan was holding her abdomen. It was growing larger and was clearly throbbing.
 Han Jue felt a strong vitality. It was his son!
 His son was finally about to be born now that he was no longer the Primordial Fiendcelestial.
 Xing Hongxuan was originally very flustered, but she immediately felt at ease when she saw Han Jue.
 “Husband… I think I’m about to give birth…” Xing Hongxuan said softly with a trembling voice.
 She was already a Sage and should not be afraid, but this kid’s vitality was really exuberant. He was still accumulating a force that was enough to tear her apart. How could she not panic?
 Han Jue came in front of her and placed his hand on her belly. He wrapped the fetus with the Ultimate Origin Power to prevent the fetus’ power from injuring its mother.
 “This kid…”
 However, how could his Ultimate Origin Power be absorbed by the Primordial Fiendcelestial?
 Han Jue had no choice but to weaken his strength and convert a portion of the Ultimate Origin Power into ordinary Supreme Power for his son to absorb.
 At the same time.
 In the third Dao Field, under the old tree.
 Han Qing’er suddenly clutched her chest and frowned.
  Qingluan’er noticed her abnormality and asked, “Qing’er, what’s wrong?”
 She was not the only one.
 In the depths of the chaos, Han Tuo, who was cultivating, opened his eyes. His face was also pale.
 However, unlike Han Qing’er, he already knew of his younger brother’s existence. He first thought of his younger brother whom he had never met.
 “What’s that kid doing now?” Han Tuo muttered to himself. Fortunately, Yi Tian was not at his side. Otherwise, that fellow would start nagging again.
 On the other side.
 Heavenly Dao, Buzhou Palace.
 Han Yu opened his eyes and clutched his chest. Beside him, a woman in green was meditating. Sensing his heavy breathing, she opened her eyes and looked at him.
 “Senior, what’s wrong?” the woman in green asked in confusion.
