Invincible Forbidden Lord
The Ninth Chaos was silent. Indeed, the prerequisite for him to nurture other Dao Creators was that they couldn’t threaten him. He also knew that there was no right or wrong in all of this. In the end, he was a step slower and did not surpass the Dao Creator Realm.
The Ninth Chaos said, “In that case, I won’t beg anymore. If you want to destroy me, so be it. However, your battle with me has just begun. Dark Forbidden Lord, I was once invincible. Other existences were also
invincible before me. Now that the invincible throne is given to you, how long can you last?”
Han Jue didn’t stop him.
Boom!
The Ninth Chaos self-destructed with the Transcendent Rule. The violent power
shattered this dark domain. The bodies and souls of the four restrained Dao Creators were destroyed.
Han Jue could be seen when everything returned to normal. The Ninth Chaos’ self-destruction couldn’t hurt him at all.
He clenched his right hand, and something flashed in his palm.

He looked at the other four Dao Creators he had revived.
The blank domain fell silent.
The four Dao Creators were silent, feeling despair.
Even the Ninth Chaos died?
How could they fight the Dark Forbidden
Lord?
Now…
Han Jue suddenly raised his hand. The basic power of rules of the blank domain quickly bound the four Dao Creators and sucked them into his hand.
Han Jue clenched his hand and let go. Four jade pendants appeared in his hand. The statues in the jade pendants were the four Dao Creators.
At this point, the battle between the five Dao Creators ended. The Ninth Chaos perished and the four Dao Creators were captured.
The four jade pendants floated in front of his chest and emitted a different luster.
Han Jue turned around and walked towards the Chaos.
In the Chaos.
After a long battle, more than half of the domain was already dilapidated. Countless living beings had died. Negative karma filled the various voids, making it lifeless.
In the depths of the chaos.
The battle was still ongoing.
Heavenly Venerate Xun was high and mighty
and still suppressed Primordial Despair, but his expression was already filled with impatience.
The mighty figures who were originally pleasantly surprised felt uneasy again.
Heavenly Venerate Xun was indeed powerful and had always suppressed the Primordial Despair, but that was only suppression. Primordial Despair was still lively. The hostility did not dissipate for a long time. During the battle, Primordial Despair stretched out its tongue from time to time
and devoured the world and the Great Dao Sages watching the battle to increase its strength.
The three Primordial Fiendcelestials and the Nine Chaos began to discuss
countermeasures.
At this moment, the Ninth Chaos’ clone
suddenly dissipated, stunning everyone. Immediately after, the other Chaos dissipated,
leaving only Zhao Xuanyuan and Yu Yuan. Huang Zuntian frowned. “What happened?” Zhao Xuanyuan’s expression was ugly and he did not answer. He was only the reincarnation of the Eighth Chaos and did not know of the existence of the Ninth Chaos. Yu Yuan was the same. The two of them could feel the power in their bodies being extracted. They panicked. They were not the only ones. The Chaotic Space began to collapse. Space distorted as if it was being washed by torrential rain. All of them sank. The scene was extremely strange. The three thousand Great Dao lost control, like three thousand dragons dancing wantonly above the Chaos. The Seven Supreme Rules darkened and were no longer
so holy.
All these changes were seen by the mighty
figures. Not to mention them, even all living beings panicked. The collapse of the Chaos caused the end of the billions of worlds in the
“What’s happening?”
“Could it be that the power of Heavenly
Venerate Xun and Primordial Despair is too
strong?”
“No, have you forgotten what the Dark Forbidden Lord said? The Chaos also has a
Creator. Could it be that Creator…” “Impossible… Even the existence who created
the Chaos died in the hands of the Dark
Forbidden Lord?”
The mighty figures discussed. An unprecedented uneasiness and confusion filled their hearts.
Heavenly Venerate Xun also noticed this scene. He frowned and muttered, “What’s going on? Has history changed? But why didn’t I sense it…
“Could it be because of my interference?”
The more Heavenly Venerate Xun thought about it, the more uneasy he became. If he couldn’t even resolve Primordial Despair, how could he save the living beings of the Chaos?
No!
He had to end this quickly!
He had to deal with the legendary strongest ferocious beast first, Primordial Despair! Heavenly Venerate Xun opened his arms and
all the surrounding divine weapons entered his silver armor. His entire body transformed
into a divine sword that shone with a strong light and attacked Primordial Despair. A terrifying pressure enveloped the entire
Chaos, suffocating all the mighty figures watching from afar. Endless hope surged in their hearts.
This attack had to kill Primordial Despair!
They would really be finished if he failed!
Boom-
Heavenly Venerate Xun Xian collided with
Primordial Despair. The dazzling light made the entire Chaos lose its color. The Great Dao Sages were sent flying.
Primordial Despair was still roaring. The strong light suddenly shrank. Han Huang
looked over and his expression instantly turned ugly.
A figure appeared in front of Primordial
At this moment, the Dark Forbidden Lord
grabbed Heavenly Venerate Xun’s neck with one hand and raised him high.
was struggling with all his might. Above Primordial Despair, Su Qi and Zhou Song’s Great Dao Heaven saw Han Jue’s back
and their faces immediately turned pale.
Thinking back to the Dark Forbidden Lord’s words, could it be…
More and more Great Dao Sages noticed Han Jue. They were all in despair. The Dark Forbidden Lord had returned! This meant that the Chaos was about to be
destroyed!
Heavenly Venerate Xun couldn’t escape Han
Jue’s hand. This hand contained an extremely
powerful sealing ability. Impossible!
Heavenly Venerate Xun widened his eyes and
looked at Han Jue in disbelief. “Who… are you?” Heavenly Venerate Xun asked with a trembling voice. He was a Dao
Creator. He had never suffered a loss ever since he became a Dao Creator.
Why was he unable to resist this person… “That’s right. Unfortunately, I’m telling you that the five Dao Creators, the Ninth Chaos,
the Chaotic Consciousness, the Formless Transcendent Deity, the Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity, and Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction Venerable, have already died in my hands. No stronger existence can save
you.
“You don’t have to struggle. Wait for it to end.” Han Jue’s voice resounded through the Chaos. Even mortals could hear it. Under the gazes of the Great Dao Sages, he
clenched his right hand and crushed Heavenly Venerate Xun.
He knew very well that Heavenly Venerate Xun’s identity was related to him, so he showed mercy.
Han Jue turned around and looked at
Primordial Despair after dealing with him. Primordial Despair was licking his wounds like an aggrieved dog. Han Jue’s eyes narrowed. All Primordial Despair’s injuries recovered.
food!”
This time, no one dared to go forward.


Han Huang, Primordial Origin, Huang Zuntian, Zhao Shuangquan, the Ultimate God of Punishment, the Primordial Ancestor God, the Nine-Headed Divine Spirit, Emperor, Han Ye, Formless World, and so on.
The top mighty figures of the Chaos were all silent. They didn’t give the order to attack, much less boost morale.
Despair and fear spread throughout the Chaos.
Han Jue was disappointed and pretended to be disdainful. “Are you really giving up? I originally thought that the Chaos would fight until the end. Even if you die, you will die in battle. Do you know what the Ninth Chaos who created the Chaos said before he died? Can you
“He begged me to let you all go. imagine a transcendent existence standing at the end of cultivation, controlling space and time, controlling fate, and controlling
creation begging me like a mortal?”
The Dark Forbidden Lord’s words made all the
mighty figures furious.
Han Huang looked up, his eyes filled with killing intent.
Even Primordial Origin and Huang Zuntian were the same. They almost went berserk.
No matter how they fought, they could not change a fact. All the mighty figures present were born in the Chaos and owed it a favor. Even the transcendent existence who created the Chaos fought until the end and died in battle. What were they afraid of?

Even the living beings watching the battle through the dream were infuriated, wishing they could tear the Dark Forbidden Lord into pieces.
Primordial Despair roared as if congratulating the Dark Forbidden Lord on his victory.
Boom-
Han Huang transformed into a Primordial Fiendcelestial and attacked Han Jue. He held the Divine Punishment Light Blade in his hand and wanted to cut him off, but it was easily crushed.
Han Jue was satisfied with Han Huang’s performance.
Only by daring to resist in a desperate situation could he be considered his son.
If Han Huang gave up directly, Han Jue would choose someone else to accept this Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity.
“Hidden Sect disciples, listen up. Kill!” Li Yao raised her sword and shouted softly. All the Hidden Sect disciples immediately attacked Han Jue.
Although the Chaotic Heavenly Dog was afraid, it still attacked when it was time.
Dozens of personal disciples attacked together. The Chaotic Fiendcelestials used
Han Jue waved his hand and destroyed them all. However, their souls were not injured. These disciples quickly recovered their bodies. “Creation Emperor Court, fight to the death!”
Han Ling flew towards the Primordial Despair. Her solemn and magnificent voice also made the entire Creation Emperor Court
attack.
It was the same for the other major factions.
Han Jue was satisfied.
His Hidden Sect was at least not cowardly.
True courage was to face death and the
From the point of view of the Chaos, when the Ninth Chaos died, there was no hope.
Perhaps the disciples of the Hidden Sect were still looking forward to Han Jue’s appearance, but the Chaotic mighty figures were really
hopeless.
Han Jue suddenly felt that the Chaos was not meaningless.
Perhaps he could change the situation.
Chaos was born, the Primordial Chaos was
destroyed, endless life was born, and the Chaos was destroyed. When would this cycle
end?
Han Jue suddenly became larger than the
reduced to ashes and countless worlds
shattered.
However, the Great Dao Sages quickly recovered their bodies. They also discovered
this. Why didn’t the Dark Forbidden Lord kill
them?
Primordial Despair opened his mouth and
rolled his tongue. Only then did the Great Dao Sages understand.
The Dark Forbidden Lord really thought they were Primordial Despair’s prey!
“That’s right. I like to watch the dying spirit
struggle!”
Han Jue smiled impudently and deliberately exaggerated the atmosphere of despair, giving the Chaotic mighty figures more pressure.
Then, he bent down and looked down at the
entire Chaos. His dark face revealed a pair of scarlet eyes and a mouth filled with fangs, turning into the greatest fear in the hearts of
all living beings.
“Struggle with all your might! Fear to your heart’s content!”
The Dark Forbidden Lord’s wild laughter echoed in the Chaos like thunder.
Mighty figures attacked him one after another. Their bodies were constantly destroyed and they were constantly reborn.
They continued to kill.
They ignored the Primordial Despair, but it
did not stop. It continued to devour living beings and the world.
At this moment, the mighty figures fighting to the death had already forgotten their fear. They only wanted to kill the Dark Forbidden
Lord. Han Jue waved his palms and killed them
again and again. He pretended to enjoy it and laughed extremely arrogantly.
He noticed that the dim Seven Supreme Rules
at the top of the Chaos had lit up again and were still fusing.
The power of faith of all living beings was
fusing into the Supreme Rules in a way that his senses could not spy on. Even a Dao Creator could not sense this detail. He could
only see the Supreme Rules light up. “Interesting.”
Han Jue secretly thought that if there was
really a Dark Forbidden Lord whose cultivation was inferior to the Creator Lord, he might really fail.
Now that he thought about it, the Ninth Chaos’ last words were not lies.
Han Jue ignored the Supreme Rules of the Chaos and continued to wreak havoc.
At the same time, the Third Dao Field. Xing Hongxuan, Xuan Qingjun, and the other Dao Companions came to Han Jue’s Daoist temple. The other disciples also knelt in front of the Daoist temple.
They could also see the dream of the Dark Forbidden Lord and knew what situation the Chaos was facing.
Han Jue let them in.
Qingluan’er was the first to speak, “Husband, can you move them all back?”
The other women also looked at him
anxiously.
They didn’t dare to expect Han Jue to go out
and fight. After all, they had already witnessed the Dark Forbidden Lord’s power. He was really invincible.
Xing Hongxuan didn’t say anything but looked at him. Didn’t you call yourself invincible?
His children would all die if he did not move
now! Han Jue said helplessly, “I can’t move them back. The Dark Forbidden Lord has already isolated the Chaos to prevent anyone from escaping.”
The women were silent.
Dao Comprehension Sword muttered, “Sister Li Yao is still outside…”
Chang Yue’er looked at him and hesitated.
Han Jue sighed and slowly stood up. “Forget
it.”
He started stretching. “Husband, are you…” Xuan Qingjun asked
excitedly. If Han Jue was willing to help, he must be confident!
Xing Hongxuan finally smiled. That was more like it.
for my disciples, I have no choice but to help.
Watch.”
Qingluan’er could not help but say, “If there’s really no other way… why don’t…”
She wanted to say ‘Forget it’, but it was too difficult. Her son was also outside. Han Jue said, “If I can’t win, I can also revive
in the Dao Field. Alright, go back and wait.”
With that, all the Supreme Treasures on Han Jue’s body burst out. Divine light flickered and covered his figure.
Han Huang revived again. He clenched his
fists and felt his Dharmic powers dissipate. He was filled with unwillingness. Was there really no other way? At this moment, Han Ling appeared beside
him and said, “Second Brother, I have an
idea.”
She sent a voice transmission to him. Han Huang immediately rejected it. “Impossible! I can’t accept it!”
Han Ling sighed. “Only this method can have
a chance now. As long as we can protect the Chaos, there will be a chance of survival, no matter how great the sacrifice.”


“Second Brother, there’s no time to waste. Primordial Despair has devoured more and more Great Dao Sages. If this continues, not to mention the Dark Forbidden Lord, even Primordial Despair will be enough to devour the entire Chaos!”
Han Ling sent a voice transmission. Her gaze landed on Primordial Despair.
Han Huang was furious and immediately went to stop him. In the end, his body was shattered by an invisible force.
Han Jue grabbed Han Ling’s neck and smiled teasingly. “It’s not right to plot in battle. You should die.”
He squeezed his right hand and Han Ling’s body and soul were instantly destroyed. This time, Han Ling did not revive.
This scene made the eyes of everyone from the Hidden Sect turn red.
Han Ling was Han Jue’s most beloved
daughter and also their junior sister. She
actually died just like that!
The personal disciples roared and attacked the Dark Forbidden Lord.

“You’re too weak. You’re not worthy of me killing you. Leave it to the little fellow below as food.”
Han Jue smiled disdainfully and repelled the Hidden Sect disciples again.
In front of Han Jue, who was even larger than the Chaos, all Chaos existences looked tiny.
Han Ling’s death also agitated the other mighty figures. After all, she had once been an invincible existence who had suppressed all living beings in the Chaos.
The mighty figures all lost their minds and displayed strength that surpassed that of before.
“I’ll risk it!”
“Damn it, even if I die, I have to die with a backbone!”
“I don’t believe it!”
“If you persist, there might be a chance!”
“Who else can we rely on?”
“Divine Might Heavenly Sage, that true invincible expert!”
It was unknown who mentioned the Divine
Might Heavenly Sage, but it raised morale greatly. All the Great Dao Sages of the older generation knew how powerful the Divine Might Heavenly Sage was; he had never lost.
Although the few Dao Creators mentioned by the Dark Forbidden Lord were very impressive, in the hearts of the mighty figures, they were far inferior to the Divine
Might Heavenly Sage. This was the first time they had heard of the Dao Creator Realm.
It was the same for the Hidden Sect. Their morale soared. Some people even prepared to use the Invocation Technique, but they were
stopped.
voice. His words made sense. The other
disciples no longer thought of using the Invocation Technique.
“Divine Might Heavenly Sage? Ridiculous!
“Do you really think the Divine Might
Han Jue’s laughter was filled with disdain. His majestic figure shot out countless black beams of light that shot into the Chaos.
These black beams of light were filled with destructive power. The three thousand Great Dao were shattered and most of them shot
towards the mighty figures near Primordial Despair.
In an instant, all the mighty figures could not move, including the berserk Han Huang.
Crap!
They realized that they were frozen by the
Dark Forbidden Lord. Looking at the approaching black beam of light, they felt unprecedented killing intent. This killing intent brought fear that exceeded their limits.
Han Huang stared at him. He was not afraid of death, but before he died, he didn’t avenge
Han Ling, making him filled with unwillingness.
He was still not strong enough!
If he had hurried up and worked hard to
Han Huang thought of his father and felt extremely regretful.
The Evil Heavenly Emperor looked up and
sighed.
He knew that it was over when the Formless Transcendent Deity died.
Li Yao also stared at the Dark Forbidden Lord
with a hint of pity.
choosing to fall into the cycle of reincarnation before the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity, he would not be so weak now.
Beside him, Han Qing’er was indignant and
cursed. Just as all living beings were in despair and
regret, a strong light burst out. A golden color appeared above their heads, isolating countless black beams of light. This golden
color was like the bottom of a seal, engraved with various patterns that were profound and mysterious.
No matter how the black beam of light bombarded, it could not break through the defense of the golden seal.
The golden seal covered the entire Chaos and
At the same time, the terrifying killing intent
that bound the mighty figures vanished and was replaced by an indescribable warmth. A mysterious force was healing them. “Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal…” Han Huang muttered to himself as he looked at the golden light above his head. He was overjoyed.
He was not the only one. The Hidden Sect
disciples were also overjoyed.
He still came!
“Dark Forbidden Lord, you’ve crossed the
line.”
An indifferent voice sounded. All the mighty figures turned around and saw a figure shining with divine light walking over. He was like the hope of the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity, expelling the darkness as he walked over.
That powerful aura shocked all living beings, leaving an indelible impression. This was the Divine Might Heavenly Sage!
Immeasurable Merit Divine Might Heavenly Sage!
The Dark Forbidden Lord didn’t panic when
Han Jue appeared. Instead, he teased, “You finally left the Dao Field? Unfortunately, you’re too late. If you joined forces with those
Dao Creators, you might have a chance of survival.”
Han Jue said calmly, “Since ancient times,
evil can’t defeat good. Your Dao has been
tainted by too much negative karma and will definitely perish.”
He raised his right hand, and the Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal disappeared. A divine light
shot out from his palm and soared into the sky. It pierced through the three thousand broken Great Dao and fused into brand new Supreme Rules.
you
“The Chaos is the foundation of all living beings. If you want to erase creation, have to withstand the backlash! “Feel the power of all living beings!” Han Jue’s voice resounded throughout the Chaos. As soon as he finished speaking, the new Supreme Rule shattered and turned into countless lights that scattered into the Chaos.
The mighty figures were scattered by these lights and did not have time to dodge. Immediately after, they were pleasantly surprised to find that their Dharmic powers were increasing. “This is…”
The Holy Mother of Order’s voice trembled.
Even she, who had witnessed history, could not understand this scene.
Those Divine Authority Generals became even
taller.
This was Han Jue’s little trick. He temporarily
distributed a trace of his power to all living beings and created the will of the Chaos. “Dark Forbidden Lord, face the anger of all living beings!”
Han Jue’s voice was filled with killing intent. As soon as he finished speaking, the three Primordial Fiendcelestials immediately attacked the Dark Forbidden Lord.
At this moment, their auras had actually reached the Dao Creator level. Even if their cultivation realms had not, they had the power to surpass the Dao Creator. Their
strength was no longer inferior to the Dao Creator Realm.Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎
“How arrogant!”
The Dark Forbidden Lord roared angrily and
waved his palm. Endless darkness transformed into waves that drowned the three Primordial Fiendcelestials. In the end, it was forcefully torn apart by them.


 “This power… is really strong!”
 Han Huang thought in surprise. This was a power he had never felt before. He felt that he was already omnipotent.
 Primordial Origin and Huang Zuntian were also overjoyed and extremely fascinated by
 this power.
 Dao Creator?
 They would reach that realm sooner or later!
 One mighty figure after another rushed towards the Dark Forbidden Lord.
 Primordial Despair opened his mouth and stretched out his tongue, wanting to sweep away a portion of the mighty figures, but he was easily dodged.
 He roared angrily. His huge body stirred the surrounding spatial fragments.
 The Dark Forbidden Lord did not panic when facing the attacks of the three Primordial Fiendcelestials. Instead, he easily dealt with
 them.
 It was still very difficult to hurt him even with the strength of a Dao Creator.
 “A group of ants who have obtained the pity of a transcendent being. You’re really courting death!”
 The Dark Forbidden Lord snorted coldly.
 Darkness erupted again and destroyed all the mighty figures who attacked. The three Fiendcelestials were the same.
 However, in the next second, they all revived around Han Jue.
 They turned around and saw that the Divine Might Heavenly Sage was already taller than the Chaos. The divine light on his body gave them a great sense of security as if no matter how they fought, they did not have to worry about death.
 “As expected of the Divine Might Heavenly Sage!”
 “So strong! There’s hope!”
 “Hahahaha, we’re saved!”
 “Dark Forbidden Lord, wait for death!”
 “It’s said that the Divine Might Heavenly Sage is the number one prodigy of the Chaos. He lives up to his reputation.”
 “Back in the first Chaotic Assembly, I joined forces with all the geniuses to challenge the Divine Might Heavenly Sage. I knew the difference then.”
 Han Jue stepped forward and said, “Follow behind me.”
 The mighty figures landed behind him and approached the Dark Forbidden Lord with him.
 Han Ling was dead. He felt that he had an undeniable responsibility. As a brother, not protecting his sister was the greatest irresponsibility.
 “Hahaha, that’s my father, my father!” Han
 Qing’er shouted excitedly and introduced him to the mighty figure beside her. Jiang Jueshi shook his head helplessly.
 The mighty figures began to flatter Han Qing’er. They might not care if it was in the past, but now, the Divine Might Heavenly Sage’s arrival brought them great hope and surprise. They no longer cared about their identities.
 “Come, Divine Might Heavenly Sage, let me see your strength. It’ll be meaningless if you’re as unbearable as the Ninth Chaos!”
 The Dark Forbidden Lord laughed crazily. His killing intent swept through the Chaos like a violent wind.
 Han Jue ignored the other party’s killing intent. He personally advanced against the killing intent. The violent waves were pushed away by him and the Chaotic Space kept
 collapsing.
 “Huang’er, go.
 ||
 Han Jue’s voice suddenly sounded in Han Huang’s ears, startling him so much that he looked up.
 The high and mighty Han Jue looked straight
 ahead and didn’t look at him. However, Han Huang was certain that he didn’t hear wrongly. His father asked him to attack.
 Han Huang took a deep breath and
 immediately jumped over his father’s shoulder.
 “Huang’er, I’ll teach you a Mystical Power
 now.”
 Han Jue’s voice sounded as a huge memory
 surged into Han Huang’s mind. In an instant,
 he was stunned.
 The Dark Forbidden Lord was not far away when he opened his eyes again.
 “So…”
 The mysterious power that had helped him
 father’s Dharmic powers.
 No wonder…
 Han Huang felt extremely ashamed. He
 thought that he was relying on himself, but he had always relied on his father. “Prepare for battle!”
 Han Jue’s voice sounded again, pulling his
 thoughts into reality.
 Han Huang’s eyes suddenly widened. A figure appeared beside him. It was Han Ling. “Fourth Sister, you’re not dead?” Han Huang
 asked in surprise. His voice trembled, afraid that he was dreaming.
 Han Ling smiled. “Father revived me. “The reason why I didn’t attack was that you
 and your fellow disciples had a wisp of your souls with me.” Han Jue’s voice entered the
 siblings’ ears.
 Boom-
 The Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal erupted and
 appeared in front of him, blocking the endless power of darkness.
 A pillar of light descended from the sky and
 split into two. It landed on Han Huang and Han Ling, causing their auras to increase. “Looks like the Chaotic Will chose you. In that
 case, represent the Chaos to destroy the Dark Forbidden Lord with me!” Han Jue’s voice echoed in the void. This time,
 the other mighty figures also heard it.
 They looked at Han Huang and Han Ling differently.
 They all saw that the pillar of light descended
 from the Supreme Rules. Han Jue was right. The Chaotic Will had indeed chosen them. “All of you, use your strongest Mystical Powers and attack the Dark Forbidden Lord together!”
 Han Jue’s voice sounded again. The mighty figures came back to their senses. Through Han Jue’s majestic body, they attacked together. Thousands of powerful Dharmic powers circled around Han Jue and attacked the Dark Forbidden Lord.
 Han Huang and Han Ling attacked as well. The Mystical Power Han Huang used was the Ultimate Origin Soul Oblivion. Han Ling fused ten million Emperor Soldiers into the strongest Emperor Soldier. With Han Jue’s
 help, the Dharmic powers of thousands of mighty figures attached to this strongest Emperor Soldier. The seven Divine Punishment Light Blades of the Ultimate Origin Soul Oblivion surrounded the strongest Emperor Soldier and attacked the Dark Forbidden Lord together. This was the strongest attack of the power of
 the Chaos!
 The Dark Forbidden Lord struck out with his
 palm. Darkness devoured space and time. Countless Resentful Devils roared and
 attacked, like a black wall larger than Chaos.
 Boom-
 The terrifying impact made the bodies of the mighty figures who had obtained the power of the Lord tremble and almost collapse. The
 Chaos even shattered into several pieces. Even the blank domain cracked and space-time lightning interwove.
 “That’s all you’ve got? And you want to kill me?” “What a joke! What a huge joke!” The Dark Forbidden Lord laughed wantonly,
 causing thousands of mighty figures to be moved.
 Could such power not kill the Dark Forbidden
 Lord?
 “If the power of all the living beings in the
 Chaos is insufficient, what if I join in?”
 Just as the mighty figures were panicking, Han Jue’s voice sounded, pulling them into
 hope again.
 The Divine Might Heavenly Sage, who was as majestic as the Dark Forbidden Lord, raised his right hand and extended his index finger. “That is…”
 The Hidden Sect disciples were excited, especially the disciples from the Reroll World who were too familiar with this move! Back then, when the evil devils wreaked havoc
 in the mortal world, Han Jue stood on the
 world. He destroyed the evil devils with a finger and saved all living beings.
 Heaven Earth Mystic Yellow World Piercing
 Sword Finger!
 the Creator
 Lord shot out. The sword Qi wreaked havoc above the strongest Emperor Soldier and shattered the black wall that was
 larger than the Chaos with an extremely
 domineering aura!


 The powerful Heaven Earth Mystic Yellow World Piercing Sword Finger pierced through the power of darkness. The Dark Forbidden Lord wanted to block it, but the layers of dark power he created were all pierced through. In the end, a huge hole appeared in his body. The blank domain behind tore open a long black crack. Just the width was enough to contain the Chaos. Thousands of mighty figures were shocked.
 This was even more shocking than Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction Venerable’s huge hand!
 How strong was the Divine Might Heavenly Sage?
 The Dark Forbidden Lord was not dispersed. He roared, “Divine Might Heavenly Sage, you actually have such power! However, it’s impossible to kill me! A Dao Creator is undying and indestructible!”
 Han Jue snorted. “If I can’t kill you, I’ll suppress you forever!”
 With that, a vast Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal appeared above the Dark Forbidden Lord. It was ten thousand times larger than the Chaos and descended with a world-destroying divine might.
 The Dark Forbidden Lord wanted to dodge, but strange lightning appeared around him. It was like a prison that wrapped around him, not allowing him to escape.
 Under the excited expressions of thousands of mighty figures and the anticipation of all living beings, the Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal crushed the Dark Forbidden Lord into ashes. His soul struggled with all its might in the Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal.
 “Impossible… Impossible… Why do you have such power! Why don’t you fight since you’re so strong? Why keep a low profile…” the Dark Forbidden Lord roared hoarsely. He seemed to be at the end of the line.
 These words left a deep impression on the mighty figures present.
 Under the gaze of all living beings, the Dark Forbidden Lord was sealed by the Ultimate
 Origin Heaven Seal. Han Jue retracted it
 through the air, and the Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal disappeared. Four jade pendants
 appeared in his hand.
 With a casual throw, the four jade pendants
 transformed into four Dao Creators.
 Chaotic Consciousness, Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction Venerable,
 Formless Transcendent Deity, Yin-Yang
 Purity Nirvana Deity.
 They had been sealed previously, but they didn’t lose their will. They had been watching the battle. From the point of view of the Dark Forbidden Lord, the Chaos was so weak, but they didn’t expect that with Han Jue’s appearance, everything would be reversed.
 Han Jue looked down at the shattered Chaos
 and said, “The Chaos has been broken. The old order should pass. In that case, the Endless Era can begin.”
 He waved his right hand and the Chaotic Space shattered. Heaven and earth scattered into the blank domain. In an instant, it was as if a force swept through the blank domain from the Chaos and spread endlessly. The mighty figures clearly felt that the blank
 domain had changed. It was no longer as heavy as before. They were as relaxed as if they were in the Chaos. Endless Spirit Qi filled
 the blank domain.
 The Endless Era had arrived!
 It’s over?
 The mighty figures looked at each other in
 disbelief.
 The living beings scattered in all directions
 began to cheer.
 “Thank you for your help, Divine Might Heavenly Sage!”
 The Formless Transcendent Deity was the first to bow to Han Jue. The other three Dao Creators followed suit.
 Thousands of mighty figures knelt down to Han Jue and looked at him fanatically.
 If not for Han Jue, the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity would have ended with the destruction of the Chaos and they
 would have died.
 Han Jue said, “The dead are already gone. The new era needs order and transcendence. From now on, you will control the prelude of the
 Endless Era. The other three Dao Creators will assist and confer the creation of this Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity. As for…
 “As for Primordial Despair, he has killed too many people and is sealed outside the order with the Dark Forbidden Lord. He will never
 transcend.”
 Primordial Despair let out a shrill cry of
 despair as it turned into dust under the gazes of all living beings.
 Han Huang frowned and turned his head away, unable to bear it.
 Han Ling noticed her second brother’s expression and had a guess. Her eyes revealed
 pity.
 “The Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity has ended.”
 After Han Jue finished speaking, his body that
 was shining with divine light gradually faded
 until it disappeared. The Chaotic Consciousness, Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction Venerable, and the Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity looked at the
 Formless Transcendent Deity enviously. The Formless Transcendent Deity was glad. He was also grateful to Han Jue. He had bet correctly. Han Jue was so magnanimous. The Formless Transcendent Deity began to teach everyone. He condensed the creation of the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity and prepared to reward it.
 The so-called creation was actually the power of the Chaos itself. The Chaos no longer existed and its power would be eaten by them.
 In the third Dao Field.
 Han Jue returned and was surrounded by
 Women.
 “Husband, you’re really too powerful!” “That Dark Forbidden Lord is far inferior to
