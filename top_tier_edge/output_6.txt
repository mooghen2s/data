 Han Tuo cursed. His sudden outburst shocked Yi Tian.
 Han Tuo frowned. “What do you mean? You don’t plan to return?”
 Han Tuo wanted to say, ‘I’ve already reached the Zenith Heaven Realm.’
 Yi Tian continued, “The Immortal World has already formed a fixed hierarchy. The teachings of the Sages are eternal. Even if you and I attain the Dao, we will still be controlled by the Heavenly Dao. Don’t you want to walk your own path?
 “Do You want to continue growing under the contributions of your predecessors?”
 His words touched Han Tuo deeply.
 He thought of his father.
 If he grew up in the Immortal World, it might be very safe, but it was impossible for him to surpass Han Jue.
 If even Han Jue didn’t dare to leave the Heavenly Dao, didn’t that mean that there was an existence stronger than Han Jue outside the Heavenly Dao? Then, there would naturally be stronger opportunities!
 Han Tuo was convinced.
 Han Tuo gritted his teeth. “Alright!”
 The two of them began to pursue the dark beast.
 Another thousand years passed.
 Han Jue’s cultivation level had increased a little, but there was still a long way before he could break through.
 He checked his emails as he preached.
 As he read, an email attracted his attention.
 [Your good friend Ancestor Xitian was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure and was expelled from the Heavenly Dao.]
 Ancestor Xitian was expelled from the Heavenly Dao?
 Han Jue’s heart trembled.
 Ancestor Xitian was the strongest protective umbrella of the Heavenly Dao. Previously, when the Dao Heavenly Devil attacked, it had taken advantage of Ancestor Xitian’s departure.
 Was something going to happen next!
 Han Jue looked at the 33rd Heaven and suddenly discovered another Sage.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du, South Extreme Heavenly Venerate, Sect Master Tian Jue, Emperor Xiao, Heavenly Venerate Wufa, Qiu Xilai, Shi Dudao, Li Daokong, and Fang Liang. Other than the Nine Sages, there was also another Sage!
 In other words, there were already ten Sages in the 33rd Heaven!
 Including Han Jue, there were eleven Sages in the Heavenly Dao!
 Han Jue was puzzled.
 From the looks of it, the limit of the Heavenly Dao was not the nine Sages.
 No!
 Why was the providence of the Heavenly Dao so much stronger?
 Han Jue was suddenly moved. Compared to a thousand years ago, the Heavenly Dao’s providence was like a stream turning into a river. It was not even inferior to the Heavenly Dao before the calamity.
 He counted with his fingers and discovered that it was related to Fang Liang.
 Is this kid cheating?
 Han Jue thought of the Dao Ancestor and felt that it was reasonable.
 Han Jue thought as he explained.
 A hundred years later.
 Han Jue came to the 33rd Heaven. He came to the Sage’s Dao Field and used the simulation trial to test.
 [Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage: Perfected Heavenly Dao Freedom Sage, Immeasurable Emperor, Golden Crow Ancestor, Primordial Heavenly Emperor]
 Heavenly Dao Freedom Sage?
 Han Jue was shocked and immediately left. He came to the Universal Hall and visited Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du.
 After entering the hall, the two of them sat opposite each other.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du sighed. His tone was filled with emotions and helplessness.
 Han Jue asked why he sighed.
 Han Jue asked curiously, “Whose Primordial Purple Qi did you give him?”
 He had always been curious about who the remaining Primordial Purple Qi in the hands of the Sages belonged to. Sage Fated Secrets and Sage Jin’an had died in exchange for Heavenly Venerate Wufa and Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du. Li Muyi had given the Primordial Purple Qi in his possession to Li Daokong. One of the Primordial Purple Qi in Empress Nüwa and Fuxitian had been given to Shi Dudao. The remaining one was nowhere to be seen. The two of them had already died and should not be seen.
 “The Dao Ancestor’s Primordial Purple Qi,” Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said helplessly.
 Dao Ancestor…
 No wonder the Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage could reach the perfected Freedom Sage Realm. No wonder his arrival was silent, and Han Jue, who was in seclusion, couldn’t sense it.
 Han Jue showed a frown.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “This Primordial Purple Qi has been fused by the Dao Ancestor and the Heavenly Dao. It can allow the Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage to maintain a cultivation level that surpasses the Freedom Sage. However, like us, he’s restricted by the Heavenly Dao. After leaving the Heavenly Dao, his cultivation will be affected. It’s said to be freedom, but it’s actually not. It’s just that his cultivation level is as strong as the Freedom Realm.”
 “Why didn’t you keep such a powerful Primordial Purple Qi for yourself?” Han Jue asked in surprise. Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du was also a Freedom Sage and used ordinary Primordial Purple Qi. His cultivation had to be damaged.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du shook his head. “This Primordial Purple Qi is in Ancestor Xitian’s hands. Before the Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage came, Ancestor Xitian left. It’s said that Ancestor Xitian and the elder brother of the Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage are good friends. I can’t have such a relationship.”
 Han Jue frowned.
 He knew that Ancestor Xitian had been expelled from the Heavenly Dao. Could it be that Dijun had attacked him?
 However, was Dijun stronger than Ancestor Xitian?
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du changed the topic. “Fang Liang has recently been roping in the South Extreme Heavenly Venerate, Sect Master Tian Jue, Emperor Xiao, and Qiu Xilai. The situation outside the 33rd Heaven will change.”
 Han Jue narrowed his eyes and stood up. “I’ll go see him.”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du nodded and did not stop him.
 Han Jue went to the Heavenly Dao Palace. The door opened, and Han Jue cautiously activated all his Supreme Treasures.


 Han Jue came in front of him and asked, “You still acknowledge me?”
 Fang Liang said, “I’ll acknowledge you forever. If not for you, I wouldn’t be here today. In Fang Liang’s heart, Grandmaster’s kindness is the greatest.”
 Han Jue asked, “Then, can you tell me why you want to rope in other Sages?”
 Fang Liang was silent.
 Han Jue said, “The battle of the Sages has nothing to do with me. However, if it affects the Heavenly Dao, I will also help. I want to cultivate in peace. The Heavenly Dao can protect me from being disturbed.”
 Fang Liang sighed. “What I’m doing is precisely to support the Heavenly Dao. Grandmaster, you should already know. These Sages are actually puppets with the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End controlling them. If we can’t sever karma, the Heavenly Dao will always be the puppets of the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End.
 “I want the Heavenly Dao to escape its shackles. This is also the Dao Ancestor’s will.”
 With that said, Fang Liang’s eyes became firm.
 He felt the same as the previous Heavenly Emperor. Even if he stood at the peak of the immortals, he was still a puppet in the hands of the Sages.
 Many times, they wanted to do something for the Heavenly Dao, but when it involved their benefits, they had no choice but to give up. This feeling was of extreme grievance.
 Han Jue asked, “The Dao Ancestor is already dead?”
 If not for his death, how could he be called a will?
 “Yes, the reason why the Dao Ancestor disappeared was to destroy an extremely terrifying existence. That terrifying existence wanted to devour the Heavenly Dao and the Great Dao. After the will left behind by the Dao Ancestor chose me, it told me that the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End has already been infiltrated by that terrifying existence. If the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End devours the Heavenly Dao and releases the countless terrifying things imprisoned in the Ancient Desolate, the next to suffer will be the Chaos,” Fang Liang said in a low voice.
 “Grandmaster, I know that you only want to cultivate in peace. I don’t want to drag you into the problem, but please don’t stop me. I’m already determined to dedicate myself to the Dao and risk my life for it.”
 Fang Liang’s tone was determined and no longer as indifferent as before.
 Han Jue silently used the derivation function and consumed 4 billion years of his lifespan to see that Fang Liang was not lying.
 From the looks of it, he really cared about the Heavenly Dao.
 Perhaps this was also the reason why the Heavenly Dao chose him.
 Han Jue said, “I hope you can do what you say. What do you think about the Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage?”
 The Dao Ancestor was not dead, but he told Fang Liang that he wasn’t. Han Jue felt that things might not be that simple.
 However, he couldn’t say it clearly. The current Dao Ancestor was an existence he couldn’t provoke. Even if he said it, Fang Liang wouldn’t believe him. Fang Liang was determined to stir up trouble himself.
 Fang Liang said, “We have to suppress him. He’s the saber arranged by the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End, and he won’t be the last. After the Heavenly Dao restarted, the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End has already planted three blades in the Heavenly Dao. It’s ridiculous. They didn’t choose from all living beings but sent them from the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End. Their intentions are already clear. Perhaps in their opinion, the current Heavenly Dao is nothing to fear. There’s no need to hide it. After all, the Dao Ancestor is already gone.”
 Han Jue was relieved after understanding Fang Liang’s thoughts.
 He was afraid that this fellow would collude with the Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage.
 The two of them chatted for a while more. When Han Jue left, Fang Liang personally sent him to the entrance of the hall.
 After returning to the Hundred Peak Immortal River, Han Jue sat on the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus. The first thing he did was enter the simulation trial and fight the Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage.
 An hour later.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and frowned. He couldn’t kill him!
 The Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage was not his match, but in the Heavenly Dao, the immense providence of the Heavenly Dao supported him. If Han Jue killed him ten thousand times, he would revive ten thousand times.
 It was a little difficult to deal with.
 If Han Jue became enemies with the Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage, he could only trick him out of the Heavenly Dao.
 However, if he did so, he might be killed by the mighty figures in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End.
 Han Jue began to try to subdue the Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage, but he was too powerful and difficult to suppress. If Han Jue used too much strength, he would kill him and start the revival loop.
 The Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage was truly too powerful. Even if the other Sages joined forces, they weren’t his match. Han Jue couldn’t allow such an existence to control the providence of the Heavenly Dao alone.
 Han Jue suddenly thought of the Great Dao fragment.
 When he gathered another nine Great Dao fragments, he could create a Great Dao Mystical Power that was especially used to suppress enemies.
 He currently had six Great Dao fragments and only had three left.
 As his cultivation level increased, the difficulty of triggering the system’s choice also increased.
 The Mystical Powers he had created with the Great Dao fragment were the Primordial Chaos Reincarnation Great Dao, the Great Dao of Extreme Origin, the Dark Nightmare, and the Primordial Divine Rage. They were all impressive opportunities.
 After confirming his target, Han Jue continued cultivating
 …
 More than two thousand years later, Han Jue passed the 140,000th year but still didn’t trigger the system’s choice. It was probably only triggered once every hundred thousand years.
 On this day.
 An uninvited guest arrived outside the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 Great Loose Heaven’s voice entered the Hundred Peak Immortal River, causing the disciples to be in an uproar.
 They were very familiar with the name Great Loose Heaven. If they closed their eyes and looked at the Heavenly Dao Providence Board, they would see this name there. It was still in the top position.
 After Li Daokong, Shi Dudao, and Fang Liang successfully attained the Dao, their names disappeared. They couldn’t encounter any opponents for the time being.
 Of course, the more important reason was that the Heavenly Dao Providence Board was already useless. All living beings did not care about it at all.
 As the Supreme Buddha in his previous life, Chu Shiren knew too well.
 With a word from a Sage, all living beings would fight even if they had to risk their lives.
 However, Sages were not omnipotent!
 Han Jue didn’t reply.
 Great Loose Heaven knelt in front of the Hundred Peak Immortal River, looking determined to stay.
 The living beings witnessed this scene. News spread throughout the Immortal World in the following decades and shocked all living beings.
 The Hidden Sect squeezed into the eyes of all living beings again!
 Outside the 33rd Heaven.
 Sect Master Tian Jue nodded.
 In the eyes of the Sages, Great Loose Heaven thought too highly of himself.
 Without the help of a Sage, the Immeasurable Calamity could obliterate him!


 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “You don’t have to care about Great Loose Heaven anymore. Regardless of whether he can join Han Jue in the end, you can’t suppress him.”
 There were only the Sages of the three schools of the Dao Sect in the hall. This was a small circle among the Sages.
 Even if the Jie School, the Human School, and the Chan School broke up, they were still connected inherently.
 The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate nodded. “I understand. No matter what, Han Jue is also on good terms with us.”
 Although the Hidden Sect was rapidly expanding, the South Extreme Heavenly Venerate still had a good impression of Han Jue.
 The situation of the forces in the Immortal World was ultimately a small matter. Even if the Hidden Sect controlled the Immortal World alone, they did not care. The calamity was a calamity for all living beings, but to Sages, it was only a game of chess.
 In a game, there were losses and wins. It was normal.
 “Tell me about Fang Liang. Why is he looking for you?” Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du asked.
 Sect Master Tian Jue said, “Fang Liang is testing our relationship with the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End.”
 The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate nodded.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du narrowed his eyes. “Then, what do you think?”
 The two Sages weren’t fools and naturally understood what Fang Liang meant.
 Ever since the Dark Sage King died, they had objections to the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End, but they didn’t dare to say anything.
 “Senior, speak first!” The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate said in a low voice.
 Sect Master Tian Jue also stared at him.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du understood what they meant. The two Sages did not dare to act recklessly and needed someone to lead them.
 His tone was very serious and even made one feel hysterical.
 The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate and Sect Master Tian Jue were shocked. They were only testing him. They didn’t expect Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du to be so determined.
 There was also the Great Dao outside the Heavenly Dao!
 The Heavenly Dao was controlled by the Great Dao!
 The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate said, “Since Senior said so, we can’t beat around the bush anymore. That’s right, we can’t stand the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End either! I even suspect that the Dark Sage King’s backing is those mighty figures in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End. They’re acting!”
 “I even suspect that Nüwa and Fuxitian are not dead at all!”
 Speaking of this, the South Extreme Heavenly Venerate was very angry.
 The Deity Realm of the Ruins of End always wanted to restrict the Heavenly Dao’s development. Every time the calamity erupted, the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End would send news, specifying who would win.
 The previous Heavenly Race was arranged by the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End!
 Sage Fated Secrets and Sage Jin’an obediently became dogs. What happened in the end?
 They didn’t want to be a blade that would definitely kill them. Besides, Han Jue could help them protect the Heavenly Dao.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “Since you understand, I’ll tell you the plan directly. The Heavenly Dao Sages have to stand on the same side. Fang Liang should mean this. Li Daokong is Han Jue’s disciple. Don’t worry. Heavenly Venerate Wufa, Qiu Xilai, the Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage, and Shi Dudao will be our targets.”
 “We have to pull them to our side.”
 Sect Master Tian Jue frowned. “The Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage is so powerful. What if he’s unwilling?”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said indifferently, “If Han Jue can cripple a Sage, so can we!”
 The two Sages were shocked. They didn’t expect Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du to be so determined.
 “I don’t know what happened in the depths of the Chaos. The Deity Realm of the Ruins of End’s killing intent towards the Heavenly Dao is already very obvious. The Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage is a signal. In order to support him, they even dare to attack the ancestor!” Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du’s expression darkened.
 The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate asked, “But we aren’t the Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage’s match...”
 “We can’t kill him, but in the Heavenly Dao, he can’t kill us either. What we have to do is restrain him and not let him nurture a force. When Han Jue has absolute confidence in killing the Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage, he will definitely attack. Han Jue is very smart. He will protect the Heavenly Dao.”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said firmly, “From today onwards, the three schools of the Dao Sect will target the Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage and the demons. If the Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage dares to support the demons or other factions, the three schools of the Dao Sect will besiege him! We won’t give him a chance!”
 Hearing this, the South Extreme Heavenly Venerate and Sect Master Tian Jue agreed.
 After kneeling for a hundred years, Han Jue finally moved Great Loose Heaven into the Daoist temple.
 After seeing him, Great Loose Heaven was pleasantly surprised and hurriedly kowtowed.
 Facing a Sage, what was kowtowing? I
 t was not embarrassing.
 Han Jue said, “The Sage positions are already full. Why do you feel that joining me is useful?”
 Great Loose Heaven gritted his teeth. “The Sage positions are already full even without you!”
 Han Jue smiled, but the divine light on his body covered his expression.
 Great Loose Heaven replied without hesitation, “Eternal loyalty!”
 “Oh? Then do you mind if I plot against you?”
 “I don’t mind!”
 “It seems that you’re very determined.”
 “The Sages have let me down. This is my only way. Instead of being a dog for the other Sages, I’d rather be a dog for you. I can see your attitude towards your disciples from Li Daokong. I won’t regret it. Sage, please give me a chance!”
 Great Loose Heaven placed his forehead on the ground again.
 He trembled. Even a Pseudo-Sage couldn’t suppress his emotions.
 He was gambling.
 He could only gamble like this.
 “No problem!”
 Great Loose Heaven agreed in surprise.
 (Great Loose Heaven has a favorable impression of you. Current favorability: 5 stars] Han Jue waved his hand and sent him out of the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 Great Loose Heaven’s worship was both a good and not so good thing for Han Jue.
 In his eyes, the game of Heavenly Dao was not too important.
 He cared more about the power of Sages now.
 On that day.
 A dignified voice resounded through the myriad worlds.
 “I am the Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage. I was born in the Golden Crow Divine Clan and was once the first Heavenly Emperor of the demons. The order of the Heavenly Dao has collapsed and the Sages have changed. When I return, I will set up the order of the demons and set up the order of the Immortal World. We Heavenly Dao living beings should not only kill each other and fight for providence. We should also be united and expand the Heavenly Dao in the chaos!
 “From today onwards, the demons must cultivate for the expansion of the Heavenly Dao. I am willing to use my great providence to descend on the demons. All living beings can enter the demon race and enjoy the providence of the Sages!”


 How righteous!
 In the past, the Sages had always declared what they wanted to do in the Heavenly Dao. The Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage had directly raised his target to outside the Heavenly Dao.
 However, did the Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage really think so?
 Han Jue felt that it was impossible.
 The Deity Realm of the Ruins of End couldn’t send out only fence-sitters twice. It was already ridiculous for a Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du to appear. The Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage would definitely destroy the Heavenly Dao and at least restrain its development.
 In that case, his declaration was only to rope in more living beings to join the demons and form a greater momentum.
 “I am the Human School’s Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du. The demons are no longer part of the Heavenly Dao Race. Struggling at death’s door will only hinder the development of the Heavenly Dao. From today onwards, the demons will be eliminated. If you see demons, all living beings can eliminate them!”
 “I am Fang Liang of the Heavenly Dao Sect. The Heavenly Dao Sect feels that the demons are an obstacle to the development of the Heavenly Dao and must be eradicated. The demons will immediately leave. Those who ignore the Heavenly Dao Sect will be punished by the Heavenly Dao, and the cycle of reincarnation will not tolerate it!”
 “I am the South Extreme Heavenly Venerate of the Chan School…”
 “I am Sect Master Tian Jue of the Jie School…”
 “I am Qiu Xilai of the Buddhist Sect…”
 The five Sages spoke one after another, forcefully challenging the Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage. All living beings were in an uproar.
 The demons were still celebrating just now. With the backing of a Sage, they would definitely rise in the future. In the end, five Sages wanted to eradicate them.
 They were all in despair.
 How could a Sage defeat five Sages?
 Han Jue’s impression of Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du and the other Sages changed. This shouldn’t be a self-directed act. It seemed that Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du really wanted to protect the Heavenly Dao.
 He looked up at the 33rd Heaven. There was no battle. It was silent and strange.
 It was impossible for the Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage to remain indifferent.
 Han Jue began to look forward to their battle.
 In the area of the Heavenly Dao, it was impossible for the Heavenly Dao Sages to be killed. The Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage couldn’t do anything to the Sages and would probably use the mighty figures in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End.
 With the Sages’ powerful declarations, the situation in the Immortal World changed. The demons were the most affected. Many races who had joined them left. For a time, the demons seemed to collapse.
 Jie School, in the Sect Master’s Daoist temple.
 Huang Zuntian slowly put down the jade in his hand. Sect Master Tian Jue had already given him an order to eliminate the demons at all costs.
 “Why is the battle between Sages so obvious?” Huang Zuntian found it strange.
 In the past, Sages had always been plotting in secret. Unlike this time, they were all angry on the surface.
 Huang Zuntian had a feeling that something big was about to happen.
 He fell into deep thought.
 He wanted to contact Han Jue and understand the truth. Otherwise, if he rashly targeted the demons, Sect Master Tian Jue could withstand it, but he couldn’t.
 The current demons had the backing of a Sage. The Sage couldn’t kill Sect Master Tian Jue, but killing him was as easy as flipping his palm.
 Huang Zuntian felt a headache.
 He still wanted to cultivate well and increase his cultivation level.
 Huang Zuntian thought for a moment and still ordered the disciples to besiege the demons, but it could not be too big.
 As for contacting Han Jue, he couldn’t for the time being. If Han Jue needed it, he would definitely take the initiative to contact him. If he contacted him now, it might let the unknown enemy find a flaw.
 At the same time, the forces supported by the five Sages began to issue orders to besiege the demons.
 This matter couldn’t be delayed. If it dragged on, the demons would think that the Sages were just playing around.
 The demons’ true end had just begun.
 In the blink of an eye, another thousand years passed.
 Han Jue opened his eyes.
 He was slightly satisfied.
 Han Jue checked the emails.
 (Your good friend Emperor Xiao was cursed by a mysterious curse.]
 [Your good friend Yang Du has entered the Dark Forbidden Zone.)
 (Your good friend Evil Heavenly Emperor has transformed into darkness and was enlightened by a mysterious mighty figure.)
 [Your good friend Shi Dudao was attacked by your good friend Li Daokong.]
 (Your good friend Ancestor Xitian was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure] x129
 (Your good friend Fang Liang has stepped into the River of Time. His soul has passed through the primordial era.)
 [Your good friend Ancestor Xitian was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure and was severely injured.)
 The ancestor was injured!
 Han Jue was shocked.
 Ancestor Xitian was a Transcendent Dao Expert. Even now, Han Jue couldn’t hurt him at all in the simulation trial.
 Han Jue silently used the derivation function to ask who had severely injured Ancestor Xitian.
 [Karma Heaven: Great Dao Divine Spirit, formed by the Great Dao of Karma. Later, it was controlled by Ancestor Xitian and was deprived of the Great Dao Origin. Therefore, it hates the Heavenly Dao. Because you stopped its plan to destroy the Heavenly Dao, it has developed hatred towards you. Current Hatred Points: 4 stars]
 It was him!
 Han Jue mourned for Ancestor Xitian.
 Being targeted by a mortal enemy was probably not as simple as being severely injured.
 Han Jue couldn’t help but think of Dijun, Jade Bodhi, and Seven Dao Sage. Thinking about it, the four of them had a favorable impression of him. They must have a good relationship. He didn’t expect them to stab Ancestor Xitian in the back.
 Ancestor Xitian’s tragedy strengthened Han Jue’s determination not to leave the Heavenly Dao.
 He looked at Great Loose Heaven and said, “Cultivate outside the Daoist temple and explore the Hundred Peak Immortal River.”
 Hearing this, Great Loose Heaven opened his eyes and bowed before leaving.
 He was also very curious about the Hundred Peak Immortal River, but Han Jue’s Daoist temple isolated his divine sense and he couldn’t spy on it.
 After Great Loose Heaven left, Han Jue took out the Book of Misfortune.
 He prepared to reinforce Ancestor Xitian. Coincidentally, Karma Heaven wanted to kill him.
 It would be great if Ancestor Xitian and Karma Heaven were still fighting.
 Five days later.
 Han Jue’s lifespan began to decrease. He opened his attributes panel and emails and stared at them.
 10 billion years!
 100 billion years!
 A trillion years!
 10 trillion years!
 Han Jue’s mentality was still considered calm. Perhaps he had gotten arrogant. As long as he didn’t spend more than a quadrillion years of his lifespan, it felt fine.
 His lifespan continued to decrease!
 500 trillion years!
 600 trillion years!
 [Because of your curse, your enemy Karma Heaven’s Dao heart has wavered.)
 (Your enemy, Karma Heaven, was attacked by your good friend Ancestor Xitian and was severely injured.]
 Han Jue immediately stopped.
 He sighed silently. “Ancestor, I’ve returned the favor of your preaching back then.”
 After resting for a few days, Han Jue started cursing Cundi.
 He would curse based on his Hatred Points. The higher the Hatred Points, the more he would curse first. There was no need to curse anyone below three stars.
 A month later.
 Han Jue gave Cundi and the Chaotic Deity a quadrillion years of lifespan each. The two mighty figures were cursed until their Dao hearts were damaged.
 Han Jue had an octillion years of lifespan. He didn’t even spend a significant number now.
 He suddenly had a bold thought.
 Should he take out ten quadrillion years to play?
 Even if he couldn’t curse the Chaotic Deity to death, he could at least severely injure him.
 The moment this thought appeared, Han Jue’s heart started to beat faster.
 Try!
 The Chaotic Deity had 6.5 stars of hatred towards him. The earlier he got rid of him, the better!
 Han Jue adjusted his condition for a few days and took out the Book of Misfortune again.


 Half a month later!
 Han Jue had already deducted nearly 5 quadrillion years of his lifespan. His eyes began to fill with blood. This was a huge gamble. A huge waste of lifespan! During this period of time, three emails appeared.
 (Your enemy, the Chaotic Deity, has suffered damage to his Dao heart due to your curse.]
 (Because of your curse, the Great Dao of your enemy, the Chaotic Deity, has entered chaos. The power of order has begun to collapse.) With another 5 quadrillion years of lifespan, the Chaotic Deity should be crippled. Han Jue gritted his teeth and persisted.
 There was nothing wrong with his body for the time being, but his lifespan had been deducted until his heart bled.
 5 quadrillion years.
 Even the Heavenly Dao probably did not exist for so long! “Bear with it. If I can curse the Chaotic Deity to death, the other enemies will probably be shocked.”
 Han Jue felt relieved.
 In terms of strength, he was inferior to the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End.
 He couldn’t be bothered to play tricks.
 No matter how powerful and how scheming you are, I will use this sinister method to break through!
 (The Chaotic Deity sent you a dream. Do you accept?] (The Chaotic Deity sent you a dream. Do you accept?)
 (The Chaotic Deity sent you a dream. Do you accept?]
 These notifications suddenly appeared in front of Han Jue.
 He was stunned. The Chaotic Deity had already discovered that he was the Dark Forbidden Lord? Killing intent instantly burst out from Han Jue’s eyes. Then, you’ll die even more thoroughly! After grinding dozens of times, the Chaotic Deity no longer tried to visit him in his dreams, but Han Jue’s curse was still ongoing.
 When Han Jue consumed nearly 8 quadrillion years of his lifespan, he saw two more emails.
 [Your enemy, the Chaotic Deity, has suffered damage to his Dao heart due to your curse.]
 (Your enemy, the Chaotic Deity, used a Dao Division Divine Technique to disperse karma and the chaos lost order.]
 Han Jue’s curse missed.
 This feeling was very strange, but it was also very obvious. He couldn’t curse the Chaotic Deity, as if he had already died.
 Han Jue checked his interpersonal relationships and discovered that the Chaotic Deity’s portrait was still there.
 This fellow...
 Not bad.
 Han Jue asked in his mind, “What’s the Chaotic Deity’s state now?”
 (160 billion years of lifespan will be consumed. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 He looked at the Book of Misfortune. As expected of a Freedom Numinous Treasure. How powerful! The Book of Misfortune was technically trash. Its only characteristic was that it couldn’t be deduced by others. Its curse power consumed too much lifespan. If it was thrown to other living beings, they would probably treat it as evil and not dare to use it.
 Han Jue nurtured it step by step until now. In addition, his lifespan was already terrifying, so it could have such an effect. [Dijun sent you a dream. Do you accept?]
 Another dream notification appeared. Han Jue hesitated for a moment but still chose to accept it. His identity as the Dark Forbidden Lord might have been exposed, but he still wanted to act. As long as he did not admit it, it did not count!
 This was a dream realm above the sea of clouds. The scene was beautiful, the wind was gentle, and the sun was beautiful.
 Dijun stared at him and asked, “Do you know the Dark Forbidden Lord?”
 Han Jue frowned. “Why do you ask?”
 “Are you really being cursed?”
 “Of course! What, you think I’m the Dark Forbidden Lord and want to blame me?
 I, Han Jue, have always been in seclusion and don’t take the initiative to provoke others, but I’m not afraid of trouble.
 If you insist on slandering me, I won’t admit it!”
 Han Jue said indignantly, “Senior, you’ve visited me in my dreams several times recently. You’ve changed. You’re always testing me. Have you forgotten that you wanted to fight for opportunities for me in the past? Why are you like this? What did I do wrong that made you dissatisfied?
 Remember, I didn’t use your help!”
 Hearing that, Dijun frowned.
 He sighed and said, “Something big has happened in the Chaos.”
 “What does the incident in the Chaos have to do with me? Other than the last time I dealt with the Dark Sage King, I didn’t leave the Immortal World!”
 Han Jue was still furious.
 Dijun said faintly, “The Chaotic Deity who controls the Chaotic Order was cursed by the Dark Forbidden Lord and died. Now that the Chaotic Order is in chaos, those restrained sinister devils will wreak havoc in the chaos.
 Even the restrictions of the Ancient Desolate will loosen.”
 “Who is the Chaotic Deity? What evil devil? The restrictions of the Ancient Desolate? What’s hidden there?”
 Han Jue looked confused. It didn’t matter if Dijun believed it or not. In his mind, he wasn’t the Dark Forbidden Lord at all! He didn’t know the Chaotic Deity at all! Dijun sighed. “I hope you have nothing to do with the Dark Forbidden Lord. Otherwise, you will be implicated.”
 With that, Dijun waved his sleeve and the dream shattered.
 Han Jue’s consciousness returned to reality.
 [Dijun’s hatred towards you has increased. Current Hatred Points: 3 stars]
 Hehe.
 Sages really knew how to change sides. Han Jue couldn’t be bothered to guess if Dijun believed him.
 In any case, he was hiding in the Dao Field. He would curse whoever provoked him!
 He adjusted his state of mind and continued cultivating
 In the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End, at the top of a huge tower, more than ten mysterious figures gathered in the hall.
 One of the figures said in a low voice, “He doesn’t admit it.”
 It was Dijun.
 “It’s normal for him to deny it.”
 “Didn’t he just attain freedom? How can he curse the Chaotic Deity to death?”
 “That’s right. The higher one’s cultivation realm goes, the greater the difference. Even if a Great Dao Sage is defenseless, it’s impossible for him to be killed by a Freedom Sage.”
 “Is the Dark Forbidden Lord really from the Heavenly Dao?”
 “Now that the Chaotic Deity has perished, the Dao Devils in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End have begun to kill without restraint. We still have to guard against the restrictions of the Ancient Desolate.”
 “Compared to the Dao Devils, the existence in the Ancient Desolate is what we should be most afraid of.”
 The other figures spoke.
 Cundi, Nüwa, and Fuxitian were among them.
 Nüwa sighed. “We shouldn’t have sent the Dark Sage King to attack the Heavenly Dao. I think the Dark Forbidden Lord should have nothing to do with Han Jue. Only one person might be the Dark Forbidden Lord and is most suitable for his strength.”
 All the figures were silent.
 Nüwa didn’t say it clearly, but they all knew.
 Dao Ancestor! They could visit Han Jue in his dreams, but they couldn’t deduce who the Dark Forbidden Lord was.
 There was only one existence that could make them so helpless, and that was the Dao Ancestor!
 A tall figure said, “Perhaps the reason why the Dark Forbidden Lord targeted the Chaotic Deity is not to protect the Heavenly Dao.”
 “What do you mean?” Dijun asked.
 The tall figure said, “Legend has it that the Dao Ancestor established the Ancient Desolate and suppressed all the providence of the Primordial World in the Ancient Desolate, including the Buzhou Divine Mountain, the Endless Sea of Blood, the Ancestral Magus’s corpse, and the Heavenly Sect Master.
 The Buzhou Divine Mountain is Pangu’s spine. The Ancestral Magus is Pangu’s blood essence. The Heavenly Sect Master is formed by Pangu’s Essence Soul...”
 Everyone was shocked.
 “What? You mean that the Dao Ancestor wants to revive Pangu?”
 “How is that possible? Has he gone mad?”
 “Indeed. The Dao Ancestor seems to be afraid of something. If he’s not a match, he can only hope to revive Pangu, the ancestor of legends, and seek a way out...”
 “This... If Pangu revived and discovered that we were plotting against the Heavenly Dao...” Panic and uneasiness began to fill the hall.
