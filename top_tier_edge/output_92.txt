 Yu Yuan’s trip to the Chaos had officially
 stepped onto the right track. At the same time, the third Chaotic Assembly created momentum again. After tens of millions of years, another generation of geniuses appeared, coveting the Supreme Divine Throne that represented geniuses.
 Han Jue decided not to go personally to the Chaotic Assembly this time.
 He had clones in all three Dao Fields. If any disciple was willing to leave, they could look for his clone at any time.
 Millions of years later.
 Han Jue was 110 million years old. However, he didn’t trigger the reward option, but there was an additional Creation Heaven’s Chosen.
 It seemed that he had to increase his seclusion cycle to once every ten million years. Otherwise, it would be too difficult to wait.
 
 Moreover, he also felt that five million years was too short recently.
 Han Jue started to check his emails.
 In the past five million years, his descendants and disciples had stopped fighting. Compared to the tens of millions of years before, it was indeed much quieter.
 Han Jue asked after reading the emails, “Shan’e, the Chaotic Assembly is about to
 begin. Do you want to go?”
 Shan’e opened his eyes and asked carefully, “Can I go?”
 Shan’e was pleasantly surprised and hurriedly thanked him.
 “Of course!”
 Han Jue stood up and walked out of the Daoist temple to visit his Dao Companions.
 At that time, he would send them to the second Dao Field and follow Li Yao, Dao
 Comprehension Sword, and the other
 Fiendcelestials.
 Li Yao had been keeping a low profile all these
 years, but every time Han Jue visited her, he discovered that her cultivation level had been advancing by leaps and bounds. She had long reached the perfected Great Dao Supreme Realm and was still cultivating diligently.
 It was not difficult for them to dominate the Chaos with Li Yao and the Chaotic
 Fiendcelestials around.
 Han Jue came to the second Dao Field several
 days later.
 Pleasantly surprised to see him, Dao Comprehension Sword immediately pounced forward.
 Li Yao also opened her eyes and looked at him
 quietly.
 Han Jue sat down and chatted with them about cultivation.
 Two hours later, the three of them entered the simulation trial. Han Jue fought Li Yao and Dao Comprehension Sword to test their strength.
 The two women were both Chaotic Fiendcelestials, so the difference in potential was naturally not great. It was just that Li Yao was more determined and focused on cultivating. Dao Comprehension Sword would occasionally slack off, so the cultivation years she had accumulated were inferior.
 The battle began.
 Han Jue didn’t attack but. He let the two
 women use all sorts of Mystical Powers first.
 Han Jue discovered that Li Yao’s Dao had changed. It was the Sword Dao in the past. Now, it was still the Dao of Weapons, but there were other types of weapons. Using the power of the Great Dao to transform into a weapon, it
 was even sharper.
 As for Dao Comprehension Sword, it was still the Sword Dao.
  Five minutes later.
 The simulation trial ended. The two women
 admitted defeat. Han Jue didn’t attack from the beginning to the end.
 Li Yao sighed. “We can’t shorten the difference between us no matter how hard we cultivate.” Dao Comprehension Sword nodded and looked at him with admiration.
 “I infuse Dao with all sorts of weapons, but I actually control the Dao. I want to control all powers. My Dao is to control the Dao. What do you think?” Li Yao asked seriously. Han Jue said, “That’s feasible. If you control the Dao, you can do the same thing and return
 the favor. With all sorts of divine weapons as the formation, you can reverse the stars and overturn the world.”
 The two of them began to discuss the Dao
 while Dao Comprehension Sword listened carefully.
 Han Jue finally returned to the third Dao Field
 after discussing the Dao for a thousand years and interacting with them for decades. He sat on the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus and began to look at the Chaos.
 himself. His status had risen very quickly. The Creation Emperor Court’s reputation also erupted. With the addition of the number one
 expert of the Chaos, Han Huang, how could the various overlords not be afraid?
 From the looks of it, the Creation Emperor Court was unstoppable. They would definitely be able to obtain great providence when the
 Endless Era arrived.
 Han Jue’s gaze landed on Life again.
 Life had already turned to the edge of the Chaos and was constantly spreading. Recently, it had not caused much trouble and seemed to
 be keeping a low profile.
 Han Jue discovered that Huang Zuntian was missing.
 He couldn’t find his aura in the entire Chaos,
 so he checked his friends list. Huang Zuntian’s portrait was still there.
 Han Jue was not too worried. He had greater confidence in Huang Zuntian than in Han Huang. This fellow was very capable of
 survival. His gaze landed on Li Daokong next. The current Li Daokong was the strongest Calamity Life Controller in the Life faction and was also the leader on the surface. He had fought with Laozi several times and had both
 wins and losses. He dominated the Sword Dao and became a peak existence that countless sword cultivators looked up to. Shi Dudao and Jing Tiangong were still in the
 Life faction. As believers of the Dark Forbidden Lord, they were very careful. Perhaps because the Dark Forbidden Lord had not appeared for a long time, they did not have the confidence. He looked at the Heavenly Dao next and saw that it had already entered a bottleneck. It lived in the domain under the Divine Robe Daoist
 and could be considered the overlord of a region. However, the surrounding domains were all transcendent factions, causing the Heavenly Dao to not dare to expand anymore. The Divine Robe Daoist had instructed that if the Heavenly Dao developed more than a region, it would be surrounded by the Great Dao Divine Spirits. Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du had no choice but to stop expanding. Han Jue felt that this was enough for the
 Heavenly Dao. If not for him, how could the
 Heavenly Dao be where it was today? The Heavenly Dao should be satisfied. The Heavenly Dao wasn’t his Great Dao World, so
 he naturally wouldn’t support it under
 pressure.
 Even now, Han Jue didn’t know if this Heavenly Dao was Pangu’s Great Dao World or
 the Dao Ancestor’s. Pangu had already revived and was far from
 the Heavenly Dao. He seemed to have severed ties with the Heavenly Dao and had no contact with it at all. The more this was the case, the more Han Jue felt that there was something fishy.
  Han Jue’s gaze landed on the Ultimate Origin
 World in the blank domain after observing the Chaos and the Heavenly Dao.
 At this moment, a huge battle was erupting in
 the Ultimate Origin World. Hundreds of Chaotic Fiendcelestials participated, including the figures of the Ultimate Origin Soul Race and the Nether Race, as if they were fighting for the right to speak in the Ultimate Origin World.
 Han Jue watched the battle without the slightest intention of interfering.
 The first Life Fiendcelestial to be born had already established a connection with the Nether Race. It was even Han Jue who pulled the strings. This battle could only be won by
 them in the end. If they didn’t fight, the other Fiendcelestials would probably not be convinced, so Han Jue left them to it. Even if the Chaotic Fiendcelestial died, Han Jue could use his will to create a new Chaotic Fiendcelestial.
 The Chaotic Fiendcelestials in the Ultimate Origin World had already changed greatly. They would transform one day. They would no longer be Chaotic Fiendcelestials, but Ultimate Origin Fiendcelestials.
 Of course, they were still far inferior to Han
 Jue, the Extreme Dao Ultimate Origin Body. They were only equivalent to descendants of
 the Extreme Dao Ultimate Origin Body. 


 “Progenitor, the mysterious figure I saw earlier has appeared again. He even spoke to me this time!” Shan’e suddenly opened his eyes and said with a solemn tone. If it were an ordinary person, they would definitely be shocked by him. It was too sudden.
 Han Jue, who was observing the Ultimate Origin World, frowned and asked, “What did he say?”
 “What else?”
 “That’s it…”
 That’s it?
 Han Jue didn’t understand. He stared at Shan’e.
 Shan’e smiled bitterly. “I can’t figure out this sentence, either.”
 “Why are you so shocked if you can’t figure it out? Are you deliberately teasing me?” Han Jue said in a low voice. A trace of pressure erupted, scaring Shan’e so much that he knelt down and hurriedly kowtowed to apologize.
 
 He said with a sobbing tone, “I really don’t know, but when he said this, it made me very uneasy. I keep feeling that I can’t let my guard down, much less ignore it…”
 Han Jue felt that it made sense and asked in his mind, “Why did the figure say that to Shan’e?”
 [Unable to derive its karma. The other party might have an Ultimate Dao Treasure.]
 Han Jue had no choice but to change his train of thought. “In the following hundred million years, other than the Ninth Chaos, can there be an existence that threatens my life?”
 [9 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?] Continue!
 [Impossible]
 Han Jue was relieved.
 He reminded him, “You did the right thing. You have to tell me everything no matter what happens, but pay attention to your attitude. Don’t be shocked, understand?”
 Shan’e hurriedly said, “I know my mistake. I understand!”
 Then, Han Jue stopped paying attention to the Ultimate Origin World and entered seclusion.
 He planned to spend ten million years in seclusion, so he instructed Shan’e to directly leave the Daoist temple and find his clone if he wanted to go to the Chaotic Assembly.
 Han Jue was immersed in cultivation.
 His will surpassed the Ultimate Origin World and looked down on the audience. The battles and conflicts of all living beings were only a reflection of history in his eyes. The three thousand Great Dao formed the veins of the Great Dao World. The Supreme Rules were the beams of the house. The entire world
 constantly expanded and perfected the power of rules. His cultivation level also constantly increased.
 Somehow, Han Jue saw his own Transcendent Rule.
 To a Dao Creator, the Transcendent Rule was his soul. It absorbed the Ultimate Origin World’s providence, constantly strengthening itself.
 As the Transcendent Rule strengthened, the various life forms in the Ultimate Origin World reflected in his will. Countless images
 exploded, looking extremely vast.
 This process could be said to be fast or slow.
 Ten million years had passed when Han Jue next woke up. The Chaotic Assembly had long ended, and Shan’e had already returned to his
 side.
 Han Jue’s cultivation level increased greatly. He was getting closer and closer to the late-stage Dao Creator.
 He also had another Creation Heaven’s Chosen.
 Han Jue looked at Shan’e and asked, “Was the Chaotic Assembly fun?”
 Shan’e opened his eyes and was stunned. Then, he said excitedly, “Fun! Looks good! It’s so
 lively!
 “Progenitor, I didn’t expect your identity to be so high. Those mighty figures that all living
 beings admire are actually your disciples and children. My horizons have been broadened this time. The Chaos is really big. Even if I participate in the Chaotic Assembly, it will be very difficult for me to make a name for
 myself.”
 Shan’e was extremely excited. He began to talk
 about what he had seen and heard. Han Jue
 also listened with relish.
 The Ultimate God of Punishment could
  successfully carry out the Chaotic Assembly without him around.
 Ever since the Ultimate God of Punishment
 obtained the recognition of the Ninth Chaos, his strength and authority had changed drastically. Other than Han Huang, no one
 below the Dao Creator Realm dared to provoke
 him.
 Even so, the Hidden Sect’s reputation was not humiliated. Shan’e followed Xing Hongxuan and the others and could be said to have received all sorts of treatment. No matter how strong a giant was, they could smile and treat them with extreme enthusiasm.
 Han Jue asked, “Why didn’t you participate?”
 Shan’e scratched his head. “I know my ability. I’ll just play with curses. I can’t win if we really
 fight.” Han Jue smiled and didn’t ask further.
 Shan’e said, “Progenitor, I saw a figure in this
 Chaotic Assembly. It feels very similar to the mysterious figure I encountered previously. I mean figure. As for aura, I can’t sense it.”
 “Oh? Who is it? Tell me.”
 “I think his name is Huang Zuntian. Yes, it’s Huang Zuntian!”
 Shan’e frowned. Han Jue was surprised. Han Jue didn’t show it to prevent others from
 thinking that he was related to Huang Zuntian.
 “Really?”
 “Really. It’s Life Lord Huang Zuntian. He also went to the Chaotic Assembly, but as a Chaotic Powerhouse. I was in a daze when I saw him stand up,” Shan’e said seriously. Han Jue couldn’t help but look at him in surprise. This
 Huang Zuntian was beginning to involve the Dao of Karma? Han Jue thought of Primordial Origin in Huang
 Zuntian’s body. It might be related to him.
 If not for Han Jue, Primordial Origin should have evolved into a Primordial Fiendcelestial. He might even be the son of the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity that opened the Endless Era. Now that Primordial Origin had
 perished, he could only parasitize Huang Zuntian.
 Han Jue said, “I understand. Continue cultivating.”
 Shan’e wanted to continue, but since Han Jue said so, he could only shut up.
 Han Jue began to check his emails after Shan’e
 closed his eyes.
 The Chaos stirred again after the Chaotic Assembly ended.
 Han Jue noticed that many of his good friends
 had created their own world, the embryonic Great Dao World.
 Before the Great Dao World succeeded, these
 worlds could only be considered Supreme Worlds.
 More and more Supreme Worlds appeared,
  He visited Huang Zuntian in his dreams after reading the emails.
 The dream was the Jade Pure Sacred Sect. As usual, Huang Zuntian asked for opportunities first and bowed after confirming his identity.
 Han Jue smiled and asked, “How have you been?”
 Huang Zuntian said, “Everything is fine. I’m currently in the Ancient Primordial World.” “Ancient Primordial World?”
 “That’s right. I didn’t expect the legend to be true. Primordial Origin brought me into this world. I don’t even know how I entered. In
 addition, I feel that there’s something wrong with Primordial Origin. He has already left my
 body. I can feel him absorbing a mysterious force.” Huang Zuntian frowned. Han Jue said, “The Invocation Technique I
 taught you can summon me. Don’t panic if you encounter trouble.”
 Huang Zuntian said, “Thank you, Master, but I can’t summon anyone. You shouldn’t be able to guess where I am. The Ancient Primordial World is filled with terrifying corpses. I’ve never seen such a purgatory. I’m worried that
 Primordial Origin might lose himself. Master, is Han Huang really a Primordial Fiendcelestial? Primordial Origin said that he’s the Primordial Fiendcelestial, the only
 Primordial Fiendcelestial.” 


 “I’m not sure if Han Huang is a Primordial Fiendcelestial. After all, I’m not a Primordial Fiendcelestial. However, from his potential alone, he’s indeed very suitable. Perhaps the Primordial Fiendcelestial was not nurtured by nature but relied on great providence,” Han Jue said in a low voice.
 Huang Zuntian nodded.
 The Primordial Fiendcelestial was a legend, after all. If Han Jue also knew, didn’t that mean that his background was deeper than the entire Chaos?
 “Master, it’s best to be careful. If I can’t control Primordial Origin, he will definitely take revenge on the Chaos. At that time, Han Huang will be the first to bear the brunt,” Huang Zuntian reminded.
 Han Jue nodded. “You have to be careful too. You can’t lose your life no matter what. If you can’t suppress it, then don’t. The Chaos is not as weak as you think.”
 Huang Zuntian was touched. He cupped his hands and said, “I will listen to Master.”
 The two of them chatted for a while more before the dream ended.
 Han Jue asked in his mind, “Can Primordial Origin transform into a Primordial
 
 Fiendcelestial in the Ancient Primordial World?”
 [500 trillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [Yes]
 Han Jue’s heart sank. He tried to deduce the Ancient Primordial World but failed.
 He had no choice but to use the system’s
 derivation function.
 [Unable to deduce the Ancient Primordial World’s location.]
 Han Jue teleported to the Daoist temple of the main Dao Field after seeing this. He took out the Book of Misfortune and started cursing Primordial Origin.
 However, the Book of Misfortune couldn’t capture Primordial Origin at all.
 In other words, the Ancient Primordial World
 was not in the Chaos or the blank domain at all, but in an unimaginable space.
 It seemed that he could only put Primordial
 Origin aside for the time being.
 Han Jue was hesitating to use the Invocation Dao to summon Huang Zuntian back. With his current cultivation level, he could already summon only one and not all existences who had grasped the Invocation Technique.
 He immediately tried to summon Huang Zuntian. After all, he was loyal to him.
 He suddenly frowned.
 No matter how he tried, he could not sense
 Huang Zuntian’s aura.
 “Forget it, I can only wait quietly.”
 Han Jue thought like this. It was strange. He
 summon him. Where was the Ancient
 Primordial World?
 Unable to figure it out, Han Jue could only
 cultivate diligently.
 He had to break through to the late-stage Dao
 Creator Realm first!
 Han Jue closed his eyes and started cultivating.
 …
 In the blank domain.
 The Ninth Chaos and the Immeasurable
 Destruction Venerable gathered.
 The Ninth Chaos was still a black shadow. It was not as big as the Immeasurable Destruction Venerable, but he knelt in front of
 him.
 The Immeasurable Destruction Venerable was like a condensed black cloud. His true appearance could not be seen. His posture was inhuman and emitted the vast domineering
 aura of a god.
 “How’s the situation?” Ninth Chaos asked.
 The Immeasurable Destruction Venerable replied, “We can’t find it, but the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity’s fate is getting closer and closer. We need to be prepared. When will you start the Endless Era?”
 The Ninth Chaos said, “I originally wanted to use the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity to open the Endless Era, but I need the power to surpass the Dao Creator Realm to do it. I’m still
 a little lacking. Now that the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity is attacking, this is the general trend. It can’t be stopped.”
 The Immeasurable Destruction Venerable was
 silent.
 The Ninth Chaos said, “When the Endless Era
 arrives, I will retire and you will take over my authority. However, if you want to take over this authority, you have to have power that surpasses all the other Dao Creators. This Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity is a good opportunity. If you can obtain the providence of the entire Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity, you will shake off the other Dao Creators!”
 The Immeasurable Destruction Venerable said, “I understand. I’ll prepare now.”
 The Ninth Chaos vanished.
 The Immeasurable Destruction Venerable stood
 there for a while before disappearing.
 …
 In the purple void.
 Blood Qi and Primordial Purple Qi interwove.
 Endless corpses were everywhere, like a desperate purgatory. Countless Resentful Devils seemed to be crying silently, causing space to distort.
 Huang Zuntian sat on the head of a huge
 skeleton and looked at a huge egg at the end of the Primordial Chaos. There were countless veins on the surface of the egg and light burst
 out from its depths as if a huge heart was beating inside.
 Huang Zuntian frowned and thought that all
 along, it was all thanks to Primordial Origin’s help that he could be where he was today. However, he knew that Primordial Origin also had his own goals.
 If not for his body, Primordial Origin would not
 have been able to recover his cultivation. Both sides did not owe the other anything. However, now, Primordial Origin hated Han Huang and the Chaos. He wanted to bring calamity to the
 Chaos and kill Han Huang. He couldn’t sit by and watch.
 The Calamity Life Controllers wouldn’t be able to escape death if the Chaos was destroyed. Han Huang was even his master’s son. No
 matter what, he couldn’t sit by and watch.
 “Should I attack him?”
 Huang Zuntian
 hesitated.
 He couldn’t figure out Primordial Origin’s
 current strength. He didn’t even dare to
 guarantee that Primordial Origin still needed him.
 At this moment, a tired voice floated over. “Huang Zuntian, I can’t withstand this
 Primordial Power alone. Are you willing to withstand it together with me? It can at least save you ten billion years of bitter cultivation.” Primordial Origin’s voice!
 Huang Zuntian felt that this was a trap. This was too coincidental.
 He was about to attack him when Primordial
 Origin suggested this and even pretended to be tired.
 No! Killing intent was obvious!
 Huang Zuntian stood up and flew towards the
 huge egg. He suppressed the killing intent in
 his chest.
 He was extremely nervous. He knew that he
 only had one chance. He would either live or
 die.
 …
 Ten million years later.
 Han Jue opened his eyes. This seclusion made
 him extremely close to the late-stage Dao Creator Realm. He finally smelled the opportunity to break through again. It had been nearly 70 million years since his
 last breakthrough. It was equivalent to breaking through from the mid-stage to the late-stage. It was equivalent to going from a mortal to the mid-stage Dao Creator Realm. It was obvious how difficult it was to cultivate as
 a Dao Creator.
 Han Jue estimated that he would break through in at most a million years.
 He checked the emails mainly to see Huang
 Zuntian’s situation. Soon, he frowned.
 [Your good friend Huang Zuntian was attacked
 by a mysterious mighty figure and was severely injured.] [Your good friend Huang Zuntian was possessed by a mysterious mighty figure.]
 [Your good friend Huang Zuntian only has a
 remnant soul left. He was sealed by a mysterious force and lost his will.]
 So tragic?
 Sigh.
 Poor thing.
 Han Jue still couldn’t deduce Huang Zuntian’s
 location. He was probably still in the Ancient Primordial World.
 In that case, he would break through first.
 At that time, he would wait for Primordial
 Han Jue said, “Shan’e, go out for a while. I’m preparing to cultivate a Mystical Power. I’m afraid that I’ll hurt you.”
 Shan’e, who was cultivating, opened his eyes. He nodded respectfully and left. With no more worries, Han Jue immediately
 prepared to break through with all his might. His cultivation was a secret. No one could tell he was so powerful. Only then could he hide it and surpass the Ninth Chaos! 


 Three million years later.
 Han Jue began to break through. His cultivation had already been suppressed to the extreme and was about to erupt like a volcano.
 He finally broke through after a million years. Late-stage Dao Creator!
 His Ultimate Origin Power began to increase. Even the Ultimate Origin World began to
 rapidly expand and devour the nearby blank domain.
 He checked his attributes panel as he consolidated his cultivation.

 …
 Awesome!
 This series of origin lifespans fascinated Han Jue.
 Most importantly, after reaching the late stage, one could look forward to the perfected Dao Creator Realm. Above that was the Creator Lord Realm that no one had reached since ancient times.
 Just thinking of the Creator Lord Realm made Han Jue’s blood boil.
 He was already very close to invincibility!
 Han Jue’s cultivation finally stabilized after spending nearly 800,000 years.
 The first thing he did when he opened his eyes was to take out the Book of Misfortune. Shan’e was still outside the Daoist temple. He could curse the Ninth Chaos without being discovered.
 He immediately started.
 Five days later, his lifespan decreased. A second was equivalent to ten thousand
 lifetimes.
 This time, Han Jue only spent 200 quadrillion
 years of his lifespan to damage the Ninth Chaos’ Dao heart and reduce his cultivation.
 As for how much he had fallen, he did not know. However, the Chaos showed signs of collapsing again. He did not dare to continue.
 It was fine to delay the Ninth Chaos’ progress. Han Jue didn’t mind letting the Ninth Chaos or others step into the Lord Realm after he surpassed the Creator Lord Realm.
 It was safer to have the strongest position in
 his hands. Han Jue didn’t trust others. He could give peace to all living beings, but as a living being, he didn’t believe that invincible people could protect him forever.
 After cursing, Han Jue put away the Book of
 Misfortune and let Shan’e in.
 Shan’e couldn’t wait anymore. He quickly entered the temple and knelt down.
 “Progenitor, you’ve succeeded?” Shan’e asked
 carefully. To expel him for so long, it had to be
 an impressive Mystical Power.
 Han Jue smiled and nodded. “I’m in a good
 mood. How about I preach the Dao for you and
 teach you a Mystical Power?”
 “Sure!” Shan’e agreed in surprise.
 Han Jue began to preach the Dao. During the
 techniques.
 Gradually, his Great Dao voice covered the
 entire third Dao Field, immersing all the
 disciples.
 The living beings in the third Dao Field were all enlightened by Han Jue. Their potential was not considered impressive, but with the help of the Spirit Qi in the Dao Field and Han Jue’s occasional lecture, their cultivation levels were all very strong. They were all already Freedom Sages, but because they didn’t go out, they
 didn’t make a name for themselves in the universe of stars.
 Ten thousand years passed in the blink of an
 eye.
 Han Jue began the simulation trial upon seeing
 that Shan’e was still immersed in Dao
 He challenged 200,000 Immeasurable Destruction Venerables!
 Very easy!
 As expected of a late-stage Dao Creator. The
 difference in every minor realm was worlds
 apart!
 Han Jue continued to increase the number of enemies.
 Three hundred thousand!
 An increase of one hundred thousand in one
 go!
 They were easily killed!
 It was very difficult to insta-kill those in this
 realm, but Han Jue didn’t feel any pressure.
 Four hundred thousand!
 It was still relaxed!
 Five hundred thousand!
 Han Jue began to find it difficult. The pressure
 strong.
 He stopped here. Perhaps this was not his
 limit, but as long as it was difficult, he had to be cautious. Only then would he not develop a lazy and disdainful mentality.
 Han Jue was very satisfied with his improvement. He stood up and started to stretch his muscles while checking his emails.
 [Your daughter Han Ling was cursed by a mysterious curse.]
 [Your good friend Huang Zuntian has grasped Supreme Misfortune.]
 [Your son Han Huang was attacked by your
 good friend Huang Zuntian in his dreams. His soul was damaged.]
 [Your good friend Zhao Shuangquan was attacked by your good friend Huang Zuntian in
 his dreams and was severely injured.] [Your disciple Ji Xianshen fell into a crack in
 the blank domain and into an unknown domain.]
 [Your good friend Huang Zuntian has absorbed
 the Ancient Primordial World’s providence and his cultivation has increased greatly.]
 [Your disciple Dao Sovereign was attacked by the evil devils of Shi Tian] x80092283
 [Your disciple…]
 [Your good friend Evil Heavenly Emperor has received guidance from a transcendent existence. His cultivation has increased.]
 [Your descendant Han Ye obtained a dream from a transcendent existence and learned a Great Dao Mystical Power.]
 How lively!
 Huang Zuntian was too active. To be precise,
 Primordial Origin was too active. It was unknown if Primordial Origin had snatched Huang Zuntian’s memories. Currently, Huang
 Zuntian’s favorability towards Han Jue didn’t decrease.
 In addition, transcendent existences appeared again. It seemed that the Chaotic Consciousness and the Formless Transcendent Deity had been released.
 Tsk tsk, the Dao Creator was playing chess. It was going to be good in the future.
 As Dao Creators, they were constantly suppressed. If it were Han Jue, he would definitely be furious.
 However, the Ninth Chaos was too strong. They
 were angry but did not dare to say anything. If
 they knew that the Ninth Chaos was injured or that the Dark Forbidden Lord could threaten it, they would definitely have a plan, especially
 the Chaotic Consciousness. It was extremely rebellious.
 Han Jue continued reading. The emails were abundant, but fortunately, nothing happened to the people he cared about.
 Now, he was waiting for Huang Zuntian to
 appear.
 He would attack him as long as Huang Zuntian appeared in the Chaos.
 Huang Zuntian had been loyal for so many
 years. How could Han Jue let him be harmed? However, he still couldn’t deduce Huang Zuntian’s whereabouts. He was either hiding with a Supreme Treasure or was still in the Ancient Primordial World.
 Huang Zuntian would definitely find Han
 Huang. Once the battle started, Han Huang would borrow the Ultimate Origin Power and he could find Huang Zuntian then.
 Han Jue closed his eyes and continued cultivating.
 …
 In a dark palace in the Creation Emperor Court.
 Han Huang was meditating and cultivating. His expression changed and his neck twitched slightly. Something was wrong. After a while, he suddenly opened his eyes and
 exhaled. His eyes were filled with killing intent. “You want to snatch the name of the Primordial Fiendcelestial from me? Are you worthy?” Han Huang muttered to himself with
 a murderous expression.
 He stood up and appeared in front of Han Ling.
 “Fourth Sister, I’m leaving for a period of time,” Han Huang said. Han Ling frowned. “Why?”
 Han Huang did not hide anything and told her
 about
  Life Lord provoking him. Han Ling said, “Second Brother must be
 careful. The other party is clearly provoking
 you,
 which means that he’s confident.”
 Han Huang waved his hand. “I know, so I have
 to leave to prevent that fellow from attacking
 and affecting the Creation Emperor Court.”
 one-on-one battle?”
 Han Huang laughed and left, not giving Han
 Ling a chance to say anything. Han Ling frowned as she looked in the direction he left. 


Han Ling sent a dream to Han Jue and told him about the situation after Han Huang left. Han Ling felt that this matter was very dangerous. After all, Han Huang had already made himself invincible. Under such circumstances, the other party still dared to provoke him. He was definitely confident.
The Life Lord wasn’t a nobody!
Han Jue expressed that he understood and told Han Ling not to worry.
After that, he continued cultivating.
The Chaos stirred again while Han Jue was waiting for Primordial Origin to challenge Han Huang.
Shi Tian, Consciousnessless, and the
Transcendent Great Dao Worlds all had Eternal Giants that existed in legends. They quickly gathered forces and swept through the various Great Dao Worlds, forming a giant that surpassed the various factions of the Chaos.
The consolidation of the forces of the three Great Dao Worlds also made the Chaos uneasy. The Great Dao Divine Spirits went to the Ultimate God of Punishment.
The Ultimate God of Punishment controlled the Great Dao Divine Spirits, and they supervised the various domains. The Great Dao Divine Spirits still had restrictions on the various factions, but they usually did not interfere without permission.
Under the sky, on the round platform, the gods gathered.
Apart from the Great Dao Divine Spirits, the Divine Punishers also came. All the mighty figures were waiting for the Ultimate God of Punishment to appear.
They first discussed and exchanged views. They were all uneasy about the situation of the three Great Dao Worlds. They didn’t know the Dao Creators’ game, so they had always treated Shi Tian, Transcendent, and Consciousnessless as great enemies.
Han Tuo listened silently and did not say anything.
Chi Fa also smiled. “So be it. I’m curious about who’s the Son of the Immeasurable Calamity and who can control the situation.”
Guan Bubai walked over and asked, “Where’s Han Huang? Why isn’t he here?”
Han Tuo shook his head. “How would I know where that kid is? Ask Han Ye and the others.” Guan Bubai looked at Han Ye not far away.
Han Ye replied, “Ancestor Han Huang should have gone into seclusion. We can’t find him, either.”
Seclusion?
The Divine Punishers were shocked. They had all experienced Han Huang’s strength. He was so strong but could still enter seclusion. Such potential was really terrifying.
“Looks like he’s really a Primordial Fiendcelestial.” Yi Tian sighed.
Han Huang called himself the Primordial Fiendcelestial. All living beings had always thought that he only used the Primordial Fiendcelestial as the strongest name. After all, no one had seen a true Primordial Fiendcelestial, and Han Huang was the son of a Chaotic Fiendcelestial.
Soon, the Ultimate God of Punishment appeared. All the Great Dao Divine Spirits
bowed to him.
The Ultimate God of Punishment had already
had long been forgotten.
The Ultimate God of Punishment was extremely dignified. He scanned everyone present and slowly said, “I already know why
The Holy Mother of Order asked, “Then, should we imitate the Chaos?”
The Ultimate God of Punishment shook his
head. “You don’t have to worry. The Chaos is the center of everything. Even if the other Great Dao Worlds are united, they can’t devour
can exist indefinitely, including the high cultivation realm.”
The Great Dao Divine Spirits’ blood boiled.
“Will they give the other Great Dao Worlds a chance if they kill each other?” a Great Dao Divine Spirit asked. Such rules were really strange. Would the Chaos really be fine if more than half of the Chaotic forces died?
The Ultimate God of Punishment said, “You should be able to sense that in the past hundred million years, other than the number
The Great Dao Divine Spirits were enlightened. So that was the case.
Thinking about it carefully, that was indeed the
case. If not for the Chaotic Assembly, they would have really not known that there were so many hidden geniuses. Furthermore, the Great Dao Sages that had appeared in the past
hundred million years far exceeded any previous era. This was definitely an unprecedented golden age. “In addition, regarding the Primordial Fiendcelestial, it is not the jinx that destroyed the Chaos. The Primordial Fiendcelestial will
They will surpass the Great Dao Supreme Realm and reach the unknown and mysterious
Supreme Realm!” the Ultimate God of Punishment said meaningfully.
All the Great Dao Divine Spirits’ eyes lit up. Was this opportunity so great?
Han Tuo, Guan Bubai, Murong Qi, and the
others were also tempted.
Their cultivation levels had reached the end of
their lifespan and could no longer increase even with the Chaotic Fiendcelestial’s potential. They naturally would not miss such an opportunity!
The Ultimate God of Punishment waved his
sleeve and said, “All of you, impart what I just said to all living beings. This is an opportunity for all living beings. You’re not allowed to keep
the news to yourselves!”
With that, the Ultimate God of Punishment dissipated.
These words meant that the Chaos would be
even more chaotic. To be precise, it would
…
In the center of the Chaos, countless meteors
floated in the void. Black mist floated past from time to time. It was unknown how many Inauspicious Evils were roaring silently inside.
Dressed in divine armor, Han Huang sat on the largest meteor like a statue.
At this moment, a figure flew over from afar. It was a fairy in a dress that carried seven-colored light. She was devastatingly beautiful and had a weak, pitiful appearance. She stopped in front of Han Huang and said, “Benefactor, I’ve found everything you want.” After a while, countless stones, crystal jades, and strange tendons appeared in her right hand. They circled around Han Huang like the rings of a star.
Han Huang opened his eyes and raised his
hand to cast a spell. At the same time, he said, “Thank you. You can leave.” “No, I’m willing to serve you forever.” “You know who I am. Do you think I need to be served?”
the number one mighty figure in the Chaos, Han Huang, and even the Primordial Fiendcelestial. You saved my life. I want to stay by your side,” the woman in the immortal
dress said carefully.
huge battle. With your Freedom Realm cultivation, you’ll only be reduced to ashes. Go
back. You’re a Sage and stand above all living beings in your world, but you’ll be nothing if you follow me. It’s not worth it.” The woman in the immortal dress said seriously, “I’m willing to follow you even if I’m reduced to ashes.”
