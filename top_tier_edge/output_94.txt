 “Not bad.”
 Han Jue thought as he looked at the Nine Divine Stars.
 Then, he began to check his emails and discovered that the most active person in the past ten million years was not Han Huang, not Huang Zuntian, but Zhao Shuangquan.
 Many good friends were besieging him, and the number of times he was attacked was also in the mass emails.
 Tsk tsk, was he following Han Huang’s path?
 Han Jue noticed that Zhao Shuangquan had established the Nine Extremes Orthodoxy. Could this be the prelude of the nine Chaos? Interesting!
 Wouldn’t it be even more explosive for the Nine Divine Stars to fight against the Nine Extremes Orthodoxy in the future?
 Yes!
 That’s it!
 Han Jue’s goal for the Nine Divine Stars directly grew to the nine Chaos.
 This was more meaningful!
 Han Jue smiled and didn’t say anything else.
 He began to check on Huang Zuntian. Although he was attacked, sealed, and devoured from time to time, Huang Zuntian had always been alive.
 “Why isn’t Primordial Origin here? Could it be because of Han Huang’s previous performance?”
 Han Jue thought silently. This was not a good thing. The longer Primordial Origin delayed, the more Huang Zuntian suffered.
 He secretly teleported to the main Dao Field, took out the Book of Misfortune, and started cursing Primordial Origin.
 However, his curse missed. The other party couldn’t be cursed.
 Although the Book of Misfortune was an Ultimate Supreme Treasure, it had never been to the Ancient Primordial World. Its karma couldn’t involve the Ancient Primordial World.
 What a good place. It was suitable for cultivation.
 Han Jue sighed in his mind.
 However, since the Book of Misfortune had been taken out, there was no reason to put it back.
 He would let the Ninth Chaos bear Primordial Origin’s sins!
 Han Jue started cursing the Ninth Chaos.
 Five days later, his lifespan began to decrease.
 Recently, the Chaos’ providence had increased greatly. Han Jue had to spend more lifespan to prevent the Ninth Chaos from breaking
 100 million years of lifespan!
 10 billion years of lifespan!
 A trillion years of lifespan!
 100 trillion years!
 1 quadrillion years!
 10 quadrillion years!
 100 quadrillion years!
 Han Jue saw the email that Ninth Chaos was injured, but there were no new injuries. He decided to continue cursing.
 Han Jue paused after spending 1.3 quintillion years of his lifespan. An email appeared in
 front of him.
 [Because of your curse, your good friend Ninth
 Chaos’ Dao heart shattered and he developed
 mental demons.]
 Even a powerful Dao Creator would develop mental demons?
 Han Jue didn’t dare to continue, afraid that the
 Ninth Chaos would go mad and slaughter the innocent.
 He put away the Book of Misfortune and looked
 at the Chaos.
 Indeed, the Chaos’ order collapsed. The edge absorbed countless grudges and gave birth to evil devils. They were formed by the Ninth Chaos’ mental demons and were extremely savage and terrifying.
 However, there were many Chaotic experts. These evil devils could not threaten the Chaos’
 foundation.
 Han Jue returned to the third Dao Field and
 went to visit Mo Zhu.
 On the other side.
 In a mysterious dark space.
 Two figures emitting divine light gathered. One
 of them had a huge head with eight eyes and was ghastly and terrifying. The other looked
 like a human, but his true appearance could not be seen.
 Chaotic Consciousness, Formless Transcendent
 Deity! “Do you sense it?” the Chaotic Consciousness
 asked.
 The Formless Transcendent Deity replied, “Yes, the Chaotic Rule is in chaos again. It seems that his cultivation is in trouble. It’s not that simple to surpass the Dao Creator Realm.” The Chaotic Consciousness said, “There are more and more evil devils in the Chaos. I can’t
 deduce their background. I’m afraid it’s related to him. This is not good.”
 The Formless Transcendent Deity was silent.
 The Formless Transcendent Deity asked, “But
 if he really is possessed, what is the reason?”
 to a small hill.
 The Immeasurable Destruction Venerable said,
 “I know the reason.”
 “What’s the reason?”
 “Dark Forbidden Lord!” “What? Dark Forbidden Lord?”
 The Chaotic Consciousness was a little surprised. He was the earliest Dao Creator to pay attention to the Dark Forbidden Lord.
 A long time ago, he had felt that the Dark Forbidden Lord was very dangerous, but too many living beings in the Chaos pretended to be him. Too many living beings might be the Dark Forbidden Lord. After all, the Chaos did not belong to him. He didn’t dare to kill without restraint.
 “That’s right. He asked me and the Divine Might Heavenly Sage to investigate the Dark Forbidden Lord.”
 The Formless Transcendent Deity said, “Speaking of which, the Dark Forbidden Lord
 and the Divine Might Heavenly Sage rose at the same time. However, what happened previously proved that the Dark Forbidden Lord
 was someone else. We can’t suspect him.”
 The Chaotic Consciousness said, “The Divine Might Heavenly Sage has also been cursed. The
 two sides are probably enemies. The Divine
 Might Heavenly Sage’s rise was already unbelievable. Perhaps he used some kind of fortuitous encounter. This fortuitous encounter
 might have given birth to an opposite force.”
 The two Dao Creators were silent and pondered.
 “Where’s Nirvana? When will he arrive?” The
 Chaotic Consciousness asked. The Immeasurable Destruction Venerable replied, “I can’t contact him. He should still be
 in seclusion.”
 The Chaotic Consciousness suddenly asked, “Could it be him? Could the Divine Might Heavenly Sage be related to him?” The two Dao Creators fell silent again.
 A Dao Creator couldn’t be kind to another Dao
 Creator, so they were very wary of each other. The Formless Transcendent Deity said, “Alright, let him guess. We’re only Dao
 Creators who are about to be suppressed. Instead of thinking about this, why don’t you think about how to deal with it? What should
 we do if what we guessed happens?” The Immeasurable Destruction Venerable said, “We have to join forces with the other Dao
 Creators. But, we will be easily discovered if we do this.”
 The Chaotic Consciousness said, “Let’s do it here. We can rope in the other two Dao
 Creators and open our hearts. We can only gamble.”
 The two Dao Creators hesitated for a moment before nodding.
 In the Daoist temple of the third Dao Field.
 Han Jue was cultivating when a line of words suddenly appeared in front of him.
 [The Chaotic Consciousness sent you a dream. Do you accept?]
 Han Jue ignored him. His seclusion period was not over yet. How could it be interrupted? Thousands of years later.
 [The Immeasurable Destruction Venerable sent
 you a dream. Do you accept?] Ignore!
 How annoying!
 Han Jue was unhappy. Another hundred thousand years passed. Someone sent another dream.
 [The Formless Transcendent Deity sent you a dream. Do you accept?]
 So many? Did something happen in the Chaos?
 Han Jue opened his eyes and looked at the Chaos. Everything was fine. His good friends
 were still alive.
 It was probably a trap.
 He closed his eyes again. He waited until his ten million years of
 seclusion were up before opening his eyes again. Han Jue, who was already 170 million years old, thought for a moment and sent a dream to the Immeasurable Destruction Venerable. The dream was a blank domain. Han Jue asked when he saw the other party,
 “What is it? Why did you visit my dream?”
 The Immeasurable Destruction Venerable was
 silent for a moment before saying, “Why didn’t you accept it?”
 “I was cultivating. You were not the only one. There were two others. What’s the matter?” Han Jue asked in confusion. His performance
 dispelled the other party’s suspicion.


 “Come to the blank domain. I’ll bring you to a place.”
 The Immeasurable Destruction Venerable looked at him for a while before speaking.
 Han Jue asked warily, “Where?”
 With that, the Immeasurable Destruction Venerable forcefully broke through the dream.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and asked in his mind, “Is it dangerous to meet the Immeasurable Destruction Venerable now?”
 [2 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [No]
 Han Jue secretly heaved a sigh of relief. It was good that it was not a trap.
 Actually, he wasn’t afraid. He had a way to escape even if he was trapped. His
 Transcendent Rule had long been scattered into countless parts. He could revive at any time even if he died.
 In a sense, a Dao Creator could not be killed.
 Han Jue immediately headed to the blank domain.
 In next to no time, he was enveloped by the Immeasurable Destruction Venerable’s power. He didn’t resist and let him take him away.
 Han Jue’s vision blurred, then he arrived in a mysterious dark space.
 His will swept out and discovered that this space was endless. It was actually larger than the entire Chaos. There was no life here, and it was absolutely empty.
 Vast auras descended. They were the
 Immeasurable Destruction Venerable, the Chaotic Consciousness, and the Formless Transcendent Deity.
 This was…
 Han Jue was secretly curious. They shouldn’t be surrounding him. After all, killing him like this was impossible. A Dao Creator wouldn’t be so stupid.
 The Chaotic Consciousness said, “Fellow Daoist Han, you’re really an ascetic. You ignored us even though we visited you in your dreams.” Han Jue said, “I’m not worried because I didn’t offend you. I need to focus on cultivating.”
 The Formless Transcendent Deity said, “The Chaos suffered many waves recently, and evil devils have appeared. We gathered for this matter. Now that the Great Dao Worlds have already fused with the Chaos, we will all be affected if something changes in the Chaos.” So that was it.
 Han Jue frowned. “I also sensed it before and thought that it was a sign of the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity, so I didn’t care. Could there be another reason?”
 The Chaotic Consciousness told him their
 guess. Han Jue’s expression turned ugly.
 “What should I do…”
 Han Jue was in a dilemma, as if he was thinking of a desperate situation. His expression darkened.
 The Formless Transcendent Deity said, “Now, we have to join forces and prepare early to protect our Great Dao World.”
 The Immeasurable Destruction Venerable looked at Han Jue and said, “Although your Great Dao World isn’t close to the Chaos yet, it’s only a matter of time. Therefore, let’s join forces. We won’t be discovered by that
 existence.”
 Han Jue asked in his mind, “Does the Ninth
 Chaos really not know this world?”
 [100 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [No]
 That’s good!
 Han Jue looked at the three Dao Creators and asked, “Then, how should we prepare?”
 The Chaotic Consciousness said, “We create clones and teach Dao techniques to increase the strength of the various Great Dao Worlds to
 resist the Chaotic Evil Devils.”
 That’s it?
 “We can’t directly interfere with the Chaos, that will alarm him. The number of Chaotic Evil Devils is increasing. Only by protecting our living beings can we be prepared for the next step,” the Chaotic Consciousness said. Han Jue could only nod in agreement.
 The Immeasurable Destruction Venerable said, “Come here if you think of anything in the future. This space has already been opened for you. News can’t be spread.”
 Han Jue said, “I know what not to do.”
 The Dao Creators chatted for a while more before leaving.
 Han Jue returned to the third Dao Field and
 started to think.
 Just now, when the Dao Creators mentioned
 the Dark Forbidden Lord, they all suspected the most mysterious Dao Creator.
 Han Jue was thinking about how to use the
 Dark Forbidden Lord next.
 He only had one goal. He wanted to delay the
 He wouldn’t help the other Dao Creators overthrow the Ninth Chaos because he did not have a good impression of them.
 He had to consider the balance.
 At this moment, the leader of the Nine Divine
 Stars, Han Zongdao, woke up. He asked softly, “Progenitor, is there anything you’re worried about? We’re willing to resolve your problem for you.”
 The other descendants also woke up. It was the same for Shan’e.
 Han Jue smiled. “It’s nothing. It’s just that
 more and more evil devils have appeared in the Chaos. I can’t deduce their roots, but they can’t pose a threat to the Chaos for the time being. Cultivate well. If you want to serve me, you have to at least reach the perfected Great Dao Supreme Realm.”
 Perfected Great Dao Supreme Realm! Their expressions changed drastically. It was the same for Shan’e.
 The perfected Great Dao Supreme Realm was equivalent to the peak of cultivation. They actually had to cultivate to the end before they
 could do anything for the progenitor. This was too terrifying!
 They were all mortals before they came here.
 They panicked when they thought of how long they would be in seclusion in the future. Han Jue saw through their thoughts but didn’t
 A voice came from outside at this moment.
 “Master, I’m here to visit.”
 Su Qi!
 He first entered the Hundred Peak Immortal
 River and found Han Jue’s clone before being teleported to the third Dao Field.
 Han Jue doted on Su Qi very much, so his clone
 Han Jue said, “Come in.”
 The door to the Daoist temple opened and Su Qi immediately stepped in.
 The former jinx was already one of the Sages with the highest status in the Heavenly Dao. His bearing was extraordinary and he did not look like a jinx at all.
 The Nine Divine Stars and Shan’e looked at him with curious eyes.
 Su Qi was also stunned when he saw them. He
 didn’t expect there to be so many people in the Daoist temple.
 He stopped in front of Han Jue and knelt down
 respectfully.
 Han Jue smiled and asked, “What is it?”
 Su Qi looked around.
 “Go ahead. They’re all my descendants and
 won’t be able to leave for hundreds of millions
 of years. You don’t have to worry about them knowing your matters.” Han Jue smiled.
 The Nine Divine Stars smiled bitterly. Su Qi didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. How boring would hundreds of millions of years be?
 Su Qi took a deep breath and said, “Master, I don’t want to stay in the Heavenly Dao anymore. I want to return to cultivate and
 The strongest in the Heavenly Dao was also a Great Dao Sage. Those geniuses who had reached the Great Dao Supreme Realm, such as Zhao Shuangquan, Azure Heaven Mystic, Ling, and others, left the Heavenly Dao and
 Qin
 established a force outside alone. The current Heavenly Dao had already reached its limit. Be it strength or faction, it could not increase anymore.
 Han Jue looked at him and said, “Then stay
 here and cultivate.”


 A thousand years later.
 Han Jue’s lecture ended. He discovered that although Su Qi’s cultivation level had improved, it was very slow.
 It seemed that the Heavenly Dao had really made Su Qi relax.
 How should he wake him up?
 Han Jue suddenly thought of something.
 He wanted Su Qi to seek refuge with the Creation Emperor Court. After his bad luck lost control, he would have no choice but to enter the Transcendent World, just like in the mortal world.
 Han Jue brought Su Qi to the main Daoist temple. He handed this mission to him when he woke up.
 “I see that you’re not very willing to cultivate diligently. I’ll send you to the Creation Emperor Court to fight for opportunities. I’ll visit you
 in your dreams in the future and
 preach the Dao to you,” Han Jue said.
 Su Qi looked up with a happy expression. “I’m ashamed to say this. I think so too. If I cultivate diligently, in terms of potential, I can never catch up to others. Only by pursuing opportunities can I have a chance.”
 Han Jue said meaningfully, “The Endless Era is about to arrive. Indeed, countless opportunities are about to arrive. However, don’t be used and schemed against like in the Immeasurable Calamity. Remember to visit me in my dreams in any situation.”
 Ashamed, Su Qi hurriedly said, “I won’t repeat the same mistake. If I encounter trouble that I can’t resolve, I’ll definitely look for you and won’t force myself anymore.
 11
 Han Jue said, “I’m prepared to make you lose control of the Great Dao power of your Death
 Fiendcelestial. This way, you can
 subconsciously go to the Transcendent World. I’ll erase this memory and give it back to you when you succeed.”
 Su Qi was first stunned, but then he instantly understood Han Jue’s intentions. He said, “No problem. It’s a good opportunity for me to suffer and awaken my past temperament. It’ll make me shape up.”
 Han Jue was very glad upon seeing his fighting spirit.
 Not bad, not bad.
 “Cultivate for a period of time here first. I’ll
 especially send a clone to guide you. We’ll leave in ten thousand years,” Han Jue said in a low voice.
 Su Qi naturally had no objections. Ten thousand years was not a long time for him.
 Han Jue began to check his emails after his
 main body returned to the third Dao Field.
 It was as chaotic as ever. The Chaotic Assembly
 did not cause much of a stir this time. The attention of all living beings was still on the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity.
 increased.
 It seemed that these two were also about to
 enter the calamity.
 Han Jue closed his eyes and continued cultivating after reading the emails.
 Ten thousand years later.
 Su Qi, who had a portion of his memories erased by Han Jue’s clone, left the Heavenly Dao and went to seek refuge with the Creation Emperor Court.
 Su Qi just didn’t remember that his bad luck had been strengthened by Han Jue and would lose control. It was still stable now, but as long as he encountered a fierce battle, it was very easy for him to lose control and go berserk.
 The reason was that Han Jue hoped to deceive the world. It would be too obvious if he rushed to the Transcendent World with uncontrollable
 bad luck.
 It would be fine if it was after a period of time. Now, it was not only the Chaos. The Transcendent World was also about to face a
 calamity. Chaotic battles were endless, and countless experts had been driven mad. Such a
 development was very reasonable.
 Time passed.
 Ten million years passed quickly.
 Han Jue opened his eyes. He was already 180 million years old and automatically obtained a Creation Heaven’s Chosen.
 His gaze passed through the Chaos, and,
 reputation.
 Su Qi took in a disciple after joining the
 Creation Emperor Court. That disciple died
 tragically when he went out to fight, causing Su Qi to be extremely angry. Misfortune erupted, and, after realizing that he could not restrain his bad luck, he left the Creation
 Emperor Court and began to travel alone. Wherever he passed, bad luck filled the air and the stars dried up. The Spirit Qi dissipated and the living beings found it even more difficult to withstand.
 Han Ling and Han Huang tried to help him, but
 Although Su Qi lacked his memories, he also
 realized that this was his master’s true goal, so
 he didn’t visit Han Jue in his dreams. He hadn’t encountered a desperate situation yet. Now, he was no longer a pawn that could be slaughtered at will. He could definitely run rampant in the void as a Great Dao Supreme.
 “Not bad.”
 Han Jue thought silently. He saw the Formless
 Transcendent Deity’s clone preaching everywhere.
 The Formless Transcendent Deity did not seem
 to care about Su Qi.
 Han Jue began to deduce and discovered that
 this fellow had also arranged many pawns in the Chaos, Shi Tian, and Consciousnessless. His methods were similar to Han Jue’s. In any case,
 he was causing trouble for the other Dao Creators.
 It was not only the Formless Transcendent Deity. The Chaotic Consciousness and the Immeasurable Destruction Venerable also had a
 plan.
 Good fellow, they had just formed an alliance
 and were already using such methods. Did I lead the way? Han Jue noticed that Yu Yuan, who had
 inherited the First Chaos’ Will, had already left
 hunted down and by chance, came to the Ultimate Origin World through the
 netherworld.
 Apart from Yu Yuan, cultivators from the other
 Great Dao Worlds also infiltrated the Ultimate Origin World.
 Although the Ultimate Origin World had a slow
 start, the Ultimate Origin Qi suppressed the cultivation of the outsiders. Therefore, these intruders did not cause trouble for the time
 being. They were all very well-behaved and hid in a corner to cultivate.
 They didn’t know that they were pawns and only thought that this was their opportunity. Han Jue hesitated to throw them out, but on second thought, this would offend the other Dao Creators, including the Ninth Chaos. In any case, these pawns couldn’t threaten the
 Ultimate Origin World at all. Han Jue could destroy them at any time.
 “The Ultimate Origin World’s foundation didn’t attract their fear?”
 Han Jue thought in confusion.
 His Ultimate Origin World was extraordinary.
 On second thought, they should have noticed. They wouldn’t have sent so many pawns
 otherwise.
 “If it really doesn’t work, everyone behind me
 can curse. I’ll pretend to be cursed too. In that
 case, they won’t have the time to care about me.” Han Jue’s eyes lit up.
 this unstable alliance be united.
 Han Jue first sent a dream to the Immeasurable Destruction Venerable and said that he was cursed by the Dark Forbidden Lord. At the same time, he made some cracks appear in the
 Ultimate Origin World like what happened in the Chaos.
 Han Jue came to the main Dao Field after
 ending the dream. He took out the Book of Misfortune and started cursing the Immeasurable Destruction This fellow was too weak.
 Venerable.
 Han Jue only used 10 quadrillion years of his
 lifespan to damage his Dao heart. He cursed the Chaotic Consciousness next,
 causing its Dao heart to be damaged. Then, he
 put the Book of Misfortune away. Thousands of years later. The Immeasurable Destruction Venerable gathered them again.
 It was still that mysterious space.
 He said in a low voice, “The Dark Forbidden
 Lord attacked us. Who wasn’t cursed?”
 The Chaotic Consciousness said, “I was cursed.”
 The Formless Transcendent Deity added, “Me
 too.”
 Oh my god, you really know how to act. I didn’t
 curse you!
 Han Jue ridiculed him in his heart. His expression was very ugly, and he didn’t say a
 word.


“Fellow Daoist Han, what about you?” The Chaotic Consciousness looked at Han Jue and asked.
The Formless Transcendent Deity also looked at him.
The Immeasurable Destruction Venerable said before he could speak, “He was also cursed. He looked for me before I was cursed. At that time, I even asked him to calm down. I didn’t expect us to be cursed too. The Dark Forbidden Lord is too arrogant. Does he want to challenge all the Dao Creators?”
Han Jue didn’t look at the Formless
Transcendent Deity, but even without using his gaze, a Dao Creator could observe everyone’s reaction.
This fellow was really stable.
It was as if he was really cursed.
However, he wasn’t cursed now. Instead, he was a suspect.
The Formless Transcendent Deity asked, “Where’s the Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity? Should we ask him?”
“What if he answers that he was not cursed?”
“Then, can you guarantee that he’s not the Dark Forbidden Lord? He deliberately confessed that he was not cursed, causing us to be even more suspicious.”
“Indeed not. The most troublesome thing about the Dark Forbidden Lord is not the curse, but the fact that there are no traces of him.”
The four Dao Creators fell silent.
Han Jue said coldly, “This fellow has cursed me and the Heavenly Dao Sages since I was in the Heavenly Dao. Could he be related to the Heavenly Dao?”
He would appear anxious if he suspected the other Dao Creators. It would seem true to target the Heavenly Dao he protected.
“There’s no such existence in the Heavenly Dao. Pangu and the Dao Ancestor are not Dao Creators. They’re just struggling at death’s door,” the Chaotic Consciousness replied.
The Chaotic Consciousness said, “That’s right. The Dark Forbidden Lord said that he wants to overthrow the order established by the Ninth Chaos!”
Han Jue nodded.
The three Dao Creators continued to discuss. As a junior, Han Jue listened most of the time.
They left several hours later.
They still did not understand after discussing it
for a long time. In the end, they trusted each other and exchanged more information. Han Jue sighed after returning to the third Dao Field.
Not only was a Dao Creator’s cultivation impressive, but they were also impressive
actors.
He would have believed them if not for the fact
that he was really the Dark Forbidden Lord.
These people all had ulterior motives. Although they were cursed by the Dark Forbidden Lord, they still wanted to use the situation to their advantage.
No matter what, it was fine as long as they were in chaos and couldn’t care about him.
Han Jue wouldn’t really look for the Dark Forbidden Lord. He wanted to cultivate in
peace.
Shan’e hesitated as he looked at him.
What Shan’e wanted to say was indeed related
to curses. He was still very smart and knew to be wary of the Nine Divine Stars.
They would have to go out sooner or later. As
long as they went out, he might expose his
curse power.
“Progenitor, I felt a very powerful curse earlier. It’s very likely the Dark Forbidden Lord!” Shan’e said in a low voice.
Han Jue was surprised. He didn’t expect this
fellow to really be able to walk on the path of
curses.
Han Jue said, “What did you see?”
Shan’e shook his head. “I didn’t see it clearly. I could only see a book.”
This was a scene that only the cursed could see.
Han Jue said, “I was cursed by the Dark Forbidden Lord previously. Not only me but also other transcendent existences. That’s why I left. The Dark Forbidden Lord is busy now. Be careful not to bump into him.”
Shan’e nodded. “I know. I’m indeed far from
being his match. That curse power is too
terrifying. I’ve never seen such a powerful force, even if…
“Progenitor, who are those transcendent existences you mentioned?”
He wanted to say that even he might not be that strong, but he felt that it was inappropriate, Thus, he changed the topic.
Han Jue said, “You can’t say the names of existences like me. You will bear great karma if you do. You can’t withstand it.”
Shan’e did not understand, but he felt that it
was impressive. He subconsciously shook his head and did not dare to ask anymore.
Shan’e continued cultivating after the dream
ended.
The Nine Divine Stars were still cultivating and did not notice their situation.
Han Jue was also prepared to continue cultivating, but he suddenly felt a powerful
aura.
The Nine Divine Stars opened their eyes and looked in the same direction.
The border of Chaos and the Transcendent
World!
faction. He gained dozens of domains in just ten million years. In terms of faction, he was already the number one in the Chaos. In order
to consolidate his power, he was determined to march into the Transcendent World and show off the might of the Chaos.
Han Jue saw that the Nine-Headed Divine
Spirit was also working for Zhao Shuangquan.
Wow.
This was the support of the Lord of Chaos! It wouldn’t make sense for Zhao Shuangquan not to unite the Chaos with the Ninth Chaos’
secret support.
Han Ye was younger than Zhao Shuangquan, but his strength kept increasing with his crazy slaughter. He was actually not at a disadvantage in a one-on-one battle with the other party.
The Nine Divine Stars were already Great Dao
Sages and could easily spy on this battle. They watched with relish and even discussed. Shan’e introduced Han Ye to them. He was their ancestor. They were surprised and hoped that Han Ye could win.
Han Ye was extremely powerful as he held the World Piercing Divine Origin Bow. The arrows shot out like stars and tore the Chaotic Void into countless cracks.
Zhao Shuangquan held two divine weapons
formed by the Supreme Rules in his hands. They were also powerful. His insufferably arrogant aura made all living beings think of Han Huang from a long time ago.
Han Huang had the same attitude when he
defeated all the living beings in the Chaos! Han Jue lost interest after watching for a while.
Han Huang was still around even if Han Ye lost.
Dozens of years later.
Han Ye was defeated. While the Nine Divine
Stars felt that it was a pity, another expert appeared in the Creation Emperor Court, making them exclaim and also making Han Jue open his eyes.
The Emperor of the Creation Emperor Court
had made a move!
Han Ling drowned Zhao Shuangquan with ten million Emperor Soldiers, shocking the various Great Dao Worlds!
Although ten million perfected Great Dao Supreme Emperor Soldiers were not adaptable, they crushed Zhao Shuangquan with absolute numbers.
Zhao Shuangquan’s Supreme Rules were quickly shattered. Seeing that the situation was not right, the Nine-Headed Divine Spirit immediately entered the battle and saved Zhao Shuangquan. However, they were not Han Ling’s match even after joining forces. The mighty figures of the Nine Extremes were
shocked, but they were not stunned. They joined the battle.
Han Ling’s aura was like a rainbow. She controlled ten million Emperor Soldiers to sweep through the Nine Extremes Orthodoxy, and there was no help from the Creation Emperor Court.
She fought the famous Nine Extremes
Orthodoxy alone!


They weren’t the Emperor’s match even if the Nine Extremes Orthodoxy attacked together!
All living beings saw a new invincible person when the Nine Extremes Orthodoxy fled under Zhao Shuangquan’s lead.
Creation Emperor Court, Emperor!
Ten million Emperor Soldiers were too powerful and spectacular, leaving an indelible impression on all the spectators.
In the third Dao Field.
The Nine Divine Stars and Shan’e walked out of the Daoist temple and discussed outside, afraid of disturbing Han Jue.
“That’s Ancestor Han Ling? How powerful.”
“My Han family is really strong. We can’t be a burden.”
“Han Huang, Han Ling, Han Ye, Han Tuo, Han Yao, and Han Bashen. Tsk tsk, these are all existences whose names shake the Chaos. I wonder when we can make our own name.”
“Cultivate well. The progenitor still thinks highly of you. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have specially brought you to his side to cultivate.”
“When did Ancestor Han Huang go out?” “How many Han family disciples are there in the Creation Emperor Court?”
His descendants discussed animatedly. Even the disciples of the third Dao Field surrounded him and spoke excitedly.
Although the disciples of the third Dao Field did not go out, in the long years, they grew to like to observe the Chaos. What they saw and heard far exceeded the Nine Divine Stars, so they listened to their words very seriously.
Han Jue was immersed in cultivation and didn’t care about this.
The battle between Zhao Shuangquan and Han Ling was a battle between juniors. He wouldn’t
care as long as the Ninth Chaos did not
interfere.
Han Jue was already at the late-stage Dao Creator Realm. Perhaps he couldn’t insta-kill the Ninth Chaos, but he wouldn’t be afraid of the other party if they really fought.
He was just afraid of trouble.
…
At the edge of the Chaos.
Li Daokong stepped on a long sword and swept through the void.
A huge darkness ahead kept squirming. It was ghastly and terrifying.
Upon a careful look, the darkness was actually formed by countless evil devils. These evil
“It’s already so serious…” Li Daokong frowned as he muttered to himself.
His eyes narrowed as countless sword Qi shot
out from his eyes. They were like a torrent of time that drowned the endless evil devils, wanting to kill them all.
The evil devils vanished after the sword Qi dissipated.
Li Daokong wanted to turn around and leave.
At this moment, he suddenly saw countless evil devils appear in the depths of the void. The space in all directions cracked and huge evil devils crawled out.
In an instant, Li Daokong was surrounded.
Li Daokong frowned. Countless green gazes landed on him, but he did not panic.
Li Daokong thought silently. At this moment,
the evil devils from all directions roared and attacked at the same time. Their speed was extremely fast, like countless black beams of light.
A huge battle instantly erupted!
This was only a reflection of the situation in
the Chaos. When the forces in the center were
fighting with the other Great Dao Worlds, the forces at the edge were attacked by the evil
devils.
These evil devils were different from the evil
devils they knew. The power of the Great Dao
could not hurt them, so they could only use Dharmic powers. Furthermore, the evil devils’ cultivation was very strong. Ordinary living beings were not their match at all. Millions of years later.
The number of Chaotic Evil Devils did not
decrease but increased instead. Furthermore, they erupted with unstoppable momentum and endangered the entire Chaos. It was not only the Chaos. Evil devils also appeared in Shi Tian, Transcendent, and Consciousnessless. The number had already reached an uncontrollable level, causing the various factions to have no choice but to stop fighting.
[The Ninth Chaos has developed hatred towards you. Current Hatred Points: 5 stars]
Han Jue, who was cultivating, was shocked when he saw this notification.
He hurriedly asked in his mind, “The Ninth
Chaos is certain that I’m the Dark Forbidden
Lord?”
[100 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
Continue!
[It’s just suspicion.]
“Then, does he suspect all the Dao Creators?”
[Yes] The two questions were similar, so his lifespan was not deducted again.
Han Jue hesitated for a moment before continuing, “Can I curse the Ninth Chaos to death if I use all my strength?”
Five stars of hatred was too high. Han Jue also
surged with killing intent.
[100 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
Continue!
[No, but the Ninth Chaos will lose his will. His
power will cause chaos everywhere.]
Seeing this, Han Jue had no choice but to give
up on using the Book of Misfortune. Losing his will was actually equivalent to death to a Dao Creator, but the Ninth Chaos’ power
would wreak havoc. This couldn’t be ignored. Once that happened, other than his Dao Field,
all existences would be destroyed, including his Ultimate Origin World.
He couldn’t take the Ultimate Origin World into
the Dao Field. Han Jue’s cultivation would stop growing once his Great Dao World was destroyed. Therefore, be it for public or private reasons, he couldn’t do that.
Forget it.
So be it if he couldn’t control it.
He continued cultivating.
Han Jue retracted his thoughts.
He ended his seclusion after ten million years.
190 million years old, accumulating five
Creation Heaven’s Chosen!
Han Jue opened his eyes and smiled. His cultivation level could still improve after
reaching the late-stage Dao Creator Realm. Although he was far from perfection, this
“Progenitor, you’re awake. Something big has happened in the Chaos!” Shan’e said with a nervous expression, causing the Nine Divine Stars to open their eyes.
“Yes, yes!”
“There are too many evil devils. We can’t kill
Han Huang was even born!”
“The Chaos is already in chaos.” “What does that have to do with us? Didn’t
demons attack the Dao Field previously? They can’t barge in at all.”
“They can’t break in now, but what about in
the future? We can’t just sit and wait for
death.”
Han Jue looked at the Chaos after hearing what they said.
He saw an extremely powerful evil devil that was stronger than ordinary perfected Great Dao Supremes. In terms of aura, it was indeed not inferior to Han Huang. Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil!
The Ninth Chaos’ mental demon! Could it be that the Ninth Chaos was really about to lose control?
Han Jue said, “Alright, cultivate well. What happens outside the Dao Field has nothing to do with you.
His descendants immediately quietened
down.
Their uneasiness immediately dissipated upon seeing Han Jue’s calm expression. Han Jue continued to observe the Chaos and discovered that many worlds had been slaughtered by the evil devils. These evil devils
liked to eat living beings raw and then refine their souls to strengthen themselves. It could be said to be extremely sinister. If they died in
the hands of the evil devils, they wouldn’t even have a chance to reincarnate. “Eh? He’s here too?”
Han Jue raised his eyebrows and joy flashed
across his eyes.
