 Han Jue could only use the derivation function.
 (200 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 A figure appeared in Han Jue’s mind. It was Huang Zuntian.
 He heaved a sigh of relief. It seemed a waste, but at least he was certain that it was not taken away by an unknown existence.
 With Primordial Origin, perhaps Huang Zuntian could rise, just like the relationship between Long Hao and Hao Tian.
  Speaking of Long Hao, his development was not bad. The Dragon Race was also one of the top races in the Heavenly Dao. Their forces had also spread to the Chaos.
 The Heavenly Dao Sage Seat later could help him fight for it.
 Although Long Hao was restless, he treated Han Yu quite well. The Dragon Race also took good care of the Hidden Sect disciples and did not forget their roots.
 Han Jue smiled and went to the second Dao Field.
 She had already been a Pseudo-Sage before she became a Chaotic Fiendcelestial, so it wasn’t strange for her to attain the Dao.
 Li Yao opened her eyes and hurriedly stood up when she saw him.
 Han Jue smiled and said, “There’s no need to be so polite. What’s our relationship? Why are you always so distant?”
 How cautious.
 As expected of someone like me.
 Han Jue sighed in his heart. He still liked Xing Hongxuan the most.
 Xing Hongxuan had never made him feel distant, and she was very proactive!
 Han Jue chatted with Li Yao for a while before returning to the main Dao Field to continue cultivating
 It had been too long since he had broken through, causing him to inexplicably feel a sense of danger.
 He had not broken through for 120,000 years.
 A hundred and twenty thousand years!
 Han Jue felt his scalp tingle.
 Time passed quickly.
 More than ten thousand years had passed.
 This time, Han Jue didn’t rest but continued cultivating until his 400,000th birthday.
 [Detected that you are 400,000 years old and your life has taken another step forward. You have the following choices:]
 [1: Exit seclusion immediately and promote the reputation of the Primordial Fiendcelestial. You can obtain a Creation Spirit Stone, a Great Dao Fragment, a Heavenly Dao Spirit Stone, and a new function of the system.]
 [2: Cultivate in a low-profile manner and maintain your original intention. You can obtain a Creation Spirit Stone and a Great Dao Fragment.]
 Han Jue wanted to curse when he saw the new function option.
 Trying to tempt me again!
 Promote the reputation of the Primordial Fiendcelestial?
 Wasn’t that courting death?!
 Han Jue silently chose the second option.
 It had to be said that the 400,000th birthday disappointed him.
 However, it was a good thing to have another Chaotic Fiendcelestial.
 Han Jue took out the Creation Spirit Stone and focused on the Primordial World.
 Which Chaotic Fiendcelestial should he nurture this time?
 Exposure Fiendcelestial!
 The Exposure Fiendcelestial could see through all karma, Mystical Powers, illusions, and so on. Perhaps his strength was not top-notch among the Fiendcelestials, but he would be a very good support character.
 Han Jue immediately started moving.
 He continued cultivating after the Creation Spirit Stone began to fuse with the Fiendcelestial Qi.
  Time passed quickly.
 Han Jue had to break through a minor realm as soon as possible. Otherwise, he would feel suffocated.
 Although it had been peaceful recently, Han Jue never dared to fall into the trap.
 After Han Jue immersed himself in cultivation, time began to pass quickly from his point of view.
 The Heavenly Dao changed day by day. It would increase by a huge step every ten thousand years.
 During this period of time, countless geniuses appeared in the Immortal World. Some of them even spread their names in the Chaos.
 Among them was Qin Ling.
 But he still couldn’t be the only one.
 The new Sage Li Taigu ruled the Chaotic Heavenly Road with his sword and also made a name for himself. Many mighty figures who survived the previous calamity thought that he had potential that was not inferior to Li Daokong. Furthermore, he also cultivated with the ambition to surpass him.
 Li Daokong had disappeared for a long time. Li Taigu gradually replaced his name as the number one Sword Sage of the Heavenly Dao.
 Fifty thousand years passed quickly.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and heaved a sigh of relief. He started to stretch.
 Awesome!
 No wonder the Chaotic mighty figures spent a million, ten million, or even a hundred million years in seclusion.
 Han Jue already had the strongest potential. It would take him more than ten thousand years to feel improvement, let alone other cultivators.
 He wanted to continue cultivating, but a few years ago, Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du sent him a voice transmission, so he set the time at 50,000 years.
 After fifty thousand years, the Time Fiendcelestial, the Traversal Fiendcelestial, and the Fog Fiendcelestial attained the Dao one after another.
 Apart from Dong Zhuo, there were already nine Sage-level Fiendcelestials in the second Dao Field!
 There were no Heavenly Dao restrictions here. The Fiendcelestials also walked the path of attaining the Dao with their strength, so there were no restrictions on the Sage position.
 The Spirit Qi in the second Dao Field was also abundant. The space inside was vast and was enough for them to survive.
 Han Jue was very satisfied. Perhaps the Fiendcelestial Army would only show its might ten million years later, but at least they were improving.
 After chatting with Li Yao, Han Jue returned to the main Dao Field and jumped to the 33rd Heaven, then entered the Universal Hall.
 Seeing Han Jue appear, Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du immediately sent a voice transmission to the Sages still in the Heavenly Dao.
 Soon, the South Extreme Heavenly Venerate, Sect Master Tian Jue, Emperor Xiao, Heavenly Venerate Wufa, Qiu Xilai, Fang Liang, Jin Shen, Xu Dudao, Su Qi, and Li Taigu arrived.
 The Sages sat down in a row facing Han Jue and Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du smiled and introduced Li Taigu to Han Jue. Clearly, he was very satisfied with him.
 “Junior Li Taigu greets the Divine Might Heavenly Sage,” Li Taigu said respectfully. He didn’t directly hate Han Jue like the previous Xu Dudao.
 [Li Taigu has a favorable impression of you. Current favorability: 3 stars]
 Li Taigu hurriedly thanked him with an excited expression.
 He had been tense before, but in fact, he admired Han Jue.
 Before he attained the Dao, he was a prodigy who shocked the Immortal World. However, in this era, there was a person who looked down on all prodigies.
  Achieving the Dao at thirty thousand years old.
 That was an unparalleled feat since ancient times!
 In terms of contributions, the Divine Might Heavenly Sage had saved the Heavenly Dao several times. If not for him, the Heavenly Dao would have long been gone!
 It had to be said that the Sages did a good job. They packaged Han Jue’s prestige extremely well. This flattery also made Han Jue very happy.
 The other Sages smiled and nodded.
 Xu Dudao felt ashamed. Compared to Han Jue, he was indeed rash back then. However, it was a coincidence. Now that he had latched onto Han Jue, he was very satisfied and glad.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “This meeting only has one agenda. The Heavenly Dao is in danger again!”


 The Sages frowned. They had just rested for three hundred thousand years and the Heavenly Dao was about to face danger again.
 However, seeing Han Jue’s calm expression, the uneasiness in their hearts vanished.
 Including the new Sage, Li Taigu.
 “As expected of the Divine Might Heavenly Sage. He’s calm in the face of danger,” Li Taigu thought silently.
  Qiu Xilai asked, “This Divine Robe Daoist was born in the Heavenly Dao?”
 Heavenly Venerate Wufa said, “That’s right. I’ve also heard of the Divine Robe Daoist. He’s one of the ancient Great Dao Divine Spirits. The Great Dao Divine Spirits are also divided into levels. The new Great Dao Divine Spirits are all relatively low profile, but the Divine Robe Daoist and the Despair Dao Spirit are at the ancient level. In order to consolidate his status and power, he will stir up a bloody storm every once in a while and shock the Chaos. The Despair Dao Spirit has just died and the prestige of the Great Dao Divine Spirits has been damaged. The Divine Robe Daoist wants to use this chance to rebuild his prestige. This is only a signal. He will definitely attack the Heavenly Dao.”
 The Sages frowned even more.
 The atmosphere was a little oppressive.
 After all, he had never seen a Great Dao Divine Spirit or even fought with a Freedom Sage.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du glared at him. “Don’t talk nonsense. How can a Great Dao Divine Spirit be so easy to kill? Since ancient times, those that died…”
 Before he could finish, Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du stopped.
 He suddenly remembered that the Despair Dao Spirit died in Han Jue’s hands.
 He looked at him.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du continued speaking and introduced the power of the Great Dao Divine Spirits and the Great Dao Sages.
 Han Jue asked in his mind, “Can I insta-kill the Divine Robe Daoist?”
 (300 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [No]
 Han Jue’s heart trembled.
 No!
 “Can I kill him?”
 (Yes]
 This time, his lifespan was not deducted. After all, both questions involved the Divine Robe Daoist’s strength.
 Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief.
 However, there was still a risk if he couldn’t kill him instantly.
 “If I kill the Divine Robe Daoist, will I attract the anger of the Chaotic Deities?”
 After all, the Divine Robe Daoist did things in the name of maintaining the Chaotic Order.
 [1 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 (No]
 Interesting
 These Great Dao Divine Spirits all held the Chaotic Deities’ banner, but the deities did not care about them.
 Su Qi couldn’t help but ask, “Then, aren’t they stronger than the Heavenly Dao now?”
 Heavenly Venerate Wufa glanced at him and said softly, “No, the Dao Ancestor destroyed it.”
 The Sages were silent.
 Han Jue was also a little surprised.
 The Dao Ancestor was so domineering?
 The Sages relaxed when they heard that there was Great Dao merit.
 In their hearts, the Dao Ancestor was benevolent.
 “Fellow Daoist Han, what do you think?” Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du looked at Han Jue and asked. The other Sages were the same.
 The only Sage who had a chance to deal with the Great Dao Divine Spirit was Han Jue.
 Han Jue said in a low voice, “To be honest, I’m not confident. However, we have to fight if the Heavenly Dao is in trouble. Even if we survive this calamity, stronger existences will definitely threaten the Heavenly Dao in the future. We have to have the determination to protect the Heavenly Dao. This determination has to be transmitted to all living beings.
 “Fighting for the Heavenly Dao is to protect my hometown. I won’t regret it even if I die.”
 Infected by his speech, the Sages readily agreed.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du sighed. “Fight for the Heavenly Dao and don’t regret it even if you die. Alright! These words must be transmitted to the Immortal World and the myriad worlds! This will be the righteousness of the Heavenly Dao’s cultivation!”
 The Sages looked at Han Jue in admiration, especially Li Taigu. He was no longer as cold and arrogant as when they first met.
 Han Jue was secretly ashamed. I just want you to work harder. I might be the first to escape if the Heavenly Dao is really destroyed.
 An hour later, the Sages left. They were going to prepare for the Heavenly Dao Defense Battle.
 Han Jue returned to the Daoist temple. He didn’t continue cultivating but observed the Immortal World.
 He discovered that Dao Comprehension Sword, Long Hao, Dao Sovereign, Zhao Xuanyuan, Han Yu, and the others were not in the Immortal World.
 It was obvious how attractive the Chaos was to cultivators.
 Eh?
 Han Jue suddenly deduced that Dao Comprehension Sword was severely injured and was hiding in a mysterious domain.
  Tracing the karma, she and the disciples of the sect had been hunted down for hundreds of years.
 Han Jue also calculated who was chasing after them.
 He couldn’t be bothered if the difference in cultivation was not great.
 Han Jue narrowed his eyes.
 A Sage had plotted this.
 It was not a Heavenly Dao Sage, but a Sage in the Chaos.
 He continued to deduce. As long as there were no special Supreme Treasures, he could deduce existences with lower cultivation levels than him without the system’s derivation function.
 He discovered that this Chaos Sage was not only targeting the Holy Mother Sect, but also the other providence sects of the Heavenly Dao. He sent his disciples to split into dozens of groups and kill the disciples of the Heavenly Dao Providence Sects.


 Han Jue snorted. A Sage dared to scheme against the Heavenly Dao. He was courting death!
 He immediately sent a dream to Zhou Fan and passed on the image and karma of this Sage to him, asking him to kill him.
 Han Jue could also kill the other party, but there was no need.
 The difference in cultivation level was too great. How could an adult bicker with a child?
 Zhou Fan immediately agreed to this. He was very excited. Han Jue rarely instructed him to do anything, so he naturally wanted to prove himself.
 Then, Han Jue sent a dream to Dao Comprehension Sword.
  Before this, he had already deduced that Dao Comprehension Sword was not in danger for the time being and was hiding somewhere to recuperate.
 Previously, he almost caused Zhou Fan’s death. Han Jue felt bad and didn’t want to repeat the same mistake.
 The dream was under the Fusang Tree.
 The current Dao Comprehension Sword was no longer the simple and cold girl from back then. She was very similar to the past Tai Sutian. Her temperament was excellent, her beautiful face was cold, and her bearing was even more extraordinary. She had the bearing of an expert. Even if she did not open her eyes, it made people feel that she wouldn’t change even if the world collapsed in front of her.
 Dao Comprehension Sword opened her eyes and was stunned when she saw Han Jue.
 She blinked, unable to believe her eyes.
 To Han Jue, time passed very quickly, but it was not the same for Dao Comprehension Sword and the disciples outside. Compared to the last time they met, the world had already changed.
 Dao Comprehension Sword hurriedly bowed. “Master!”
 In front of Han Jue, she no longer had the dignity of the Holy Mother Sect Master. She was like a flattered disciple.
 Han Jue said, “Why don’t you ask for help if you’re in danger? Other than me, you can still ask for help through the Myriad Worlds Projection. Why insist?”
 Dao Comprehension Sword felt ashamed and touched. She thought that Han Jue had long forgotten about her.
 She replied, “I think I can still hold on. After all, the others are developing very well. Zhou Fan established the Great Dao Tower by himself, Hao’er controls the Dragon Race alone, and Su Qi controls the cycle of reincarnation of the netherworld. I…”
 Dao Comprehension Sword was extremely ashamed and wished that there was a hole in the ground for her to hide in.
 She was also enlightened.
 She was indeed a little petty.
 Many disciples died because she cared about her face.
 Dao Comprehension Sword couldn’t control her emotions. She knelt on the ground, her forehead touching the ground, and choked. “Master, please save the Holy Mother Sect!”
 Han Jue snorted. “I’ve already instructed Zhou Fan that if he encounters an enemy he can’t defeat, he can use the Invocation Technique.
 “Come back at any time if you’re tired. The Holy Mother Sect can be passed down to another disciple as long as you want to.”
 The dream shattered.
 Dao Comprehension Sword suddenly woke up. In front of her was the cave they were hiding in. The light was dim and there were hundreds of female disciples meditating and recuperating A female disciple beside him asked nervously, “Sect Master, what’s wrong?”
 Dao Comprehension Sword came back to her senses. Scanning all the disciples, her eyes became firm. She smiled softly and said, “It’s nothing. We won’t suffer anymore. It’s just that I fell into a narrow-minded state previously. The danger in front of us is actually nothing.”
 The disciples looked at each other in worry.
 Had the Sect Master gone mad?
 Han Jue continued cultivating after ending the dream.
 In his opinion, the Divine Robe Daoist would not be the last enemy of the Heavenly Dao.
 Just like that.
 Year after year passed.
 In less than eight thousand years, the reputation of the Great Dao Tower spread throughout the Immortal World. Because of their help, the vicinity of the Chaotic Heavenly Road became even safer. The Sage who had chased after the Heavenly Dao Providence Sects was suppressed by Zhou Fan in the Great Dao Tower.
 The history of how Zhou Fan became a Sage had also been dug out.
 He was also a prodigy!
 He could already defeat a Sage before he reached 400,000 years of age!
 Furthermore, he was the disciple of the Divine Might Heavenly Sage.
 Because of Zhou Fan, the Divine Might Heavenly Sage became a topic of conversation for all living beings during their meals and cultivation.
 At the same time, the Sage Sects were also taking action. They transmitted Han Jue’s spirit of ‘Fight for the Heavenly Dao and die without regrets’ to all living beings. In order to increase the effect, their disciples especially recounted the legends of the Divine Might Heavenly Sage protecting the Heavenly Dao. It made the cultivators’ blood boil.
 As time passed, this philosophy began to flourish.
 Unknowingly.
 Thirty-six thousand years passed.
 The Sages still maintained their vigilance, but all living beings did not know that they had their own wonders.
 This was an absolutely dark spatial domain where nothing existed.
 Suddenly, a hand appeared. The forearm and palm of this hand emitted a faint light, but it was extremely dazzling in the darkness.
 The mysterious hand opened and pressed down, causing a drop of water to fall down.
 The drop of water fell faster and faster, passing through the endless darkness.
 After an unknown period of time, light appeared below.
 From above, it was a cloud. The clouds below grew larger and more numerous. Countless stars gathered near the clouds. Many cities were built in all directions. One of the paths of light connected to the depths of the darkness and could not be seen.
 Heavenly Dao!
 This drop of water quickly landed at the top of the Heavenly Dao, outside the 33rd Heaven.
 An invisible force blocked the drop of water. After the water splashed, the invisible force shattered like glass. Space seemed to fold and intersect.
 After the water droplet splashed out, it transformed into countless tiny water droplets and continued to fall. Every small water droplet quickly lengthened like spears, the tips reflecting a cold light. Almost at the same time, the Sages appeared on the eaves of their respective Dao Field and looked up.
  The rain arrows that filled the sky pierced through the void clouds and fell towards the Immortal World. They were dense and extremely spectacular as if the Heavenly Dao had collapsed.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du’s voice spread into the ears of the Sages, startling them.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du waved his horsetail whisk. The white fur of the horsetail whisk turned as huge as a sea and wanted to sweep away the rain arrows that filled the sky. In the end, it was torn apart by countless rain arrows and continued to fall. It was unstoppable.
 He couldn’t block it at all!
 All the Dao Fields and buildings outside the 33rd Heaven were destroyed!
 The majestic rain arrows pierced through the sea of clouds and continued to sweep down, looking like they were going to collapse the entire Heavenly Dao!


 He suddenly opened his eyes and looked up.
 He happened to see the 33rd Heaven being pierced by countless rain arrows. The 32nd Heaven was about to suffer. This level had the main sun and the main moon. If it was destroyed, the Heavenly Dao would really suffer heavy losses.
 He clearly felt that the power of the Heavenly Dao had shattered. In other words, Chaos Sages could also forcefully enter the Heavenly Dao now.
 Han Jue immediately appeared in the 32nd Heaven. Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols appeared above his head and fused into one of them. It was the Fire Fiendcelestial.
 The Fire Fiendcelestial roared and punched out. Endless flames soared into the sky, unstoppable.
 The rain arrows that filled the sky collided with the endless flames and instantly evaporated.
  The terrifying pressure shook the 32nd Heaven. The sea of clouds churned violently, as did the sky below.
 All the living beings in the Immortal World heard the roar of the Fire Fiendcelestial and looked up in fear. The sky turned red and the sea of clouds churned as if the sky had changed. A terrifying pressure enveloped the entire Immortal World.
 Everyone was in an uproar.
 What happened?
 This was the first time they had encountered such a phenomenon.
 The terrifying pressure made all living beings uneasy, terrified, and even desperate.
 “Everyone, don’t panic. This phenomenon is the power of the Divine Might Heavenly Sage to resist the invasion!”  Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du’s voice sounded.
 The moment the words Divine Might Heavenly Sage were spoken, all living beings were instantly relieved.
 Mortals loved to argue.
 On the 32nd Heaven, the flames dissipated and the rain of arrows no longer existed.
 Han Jue immediately checked the surroundings and didn’t find any experts.
 He quickly jumped back into the temple.
 “Who did this?”
 (500 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Han Jue’s heart sank.
 This value was definitely above the Great Dao!
 Continue!
 A figure appeared in Han Jue’s mind. It was a graceful woman with a glow on her body. She was mysterious and strange.
 (Holy Mother of Order: Late-stage Great Dao Supreme Realm, Great Dao Divine Spirit]
 I knew it!
 Han Jue’s heart sank. He couldn’t stop such an existence from attacking the Heavenly Dao.
 “Why did the Holy Mother of Order attack the Heavenly Dao?”
 (500 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 Han Jue entered the illusion.
 When he opened his eyes again, Han Jue came to a blue sky. Below him was an endless sea, and he couldn’t see land. A mighty figure was at the end of the sea level. Only his upper body floated up to the surface. The sun above his head stood above the sea like a god of creation.
 Holy Mother of Order!
 There was a figure in front of the Holy Mother of Order. It was the Divine Robe Daoist.
 The Divine Robe Daoist’s robes fluttered as he smiled and said, “Holy Mother, you have to help me break through the Heavenly Dao. I’m protecting the Chaotic Order and helping the Despair Dao Spirit take revenge.”
 The Holy Mother of Order’s voice followed, extremely solemn, “The Heavenly Dao is the great karma supported by Pangu and the Dao Ancestor. I advise you, as a Great Dao Divine Spirit, not to be involved in this karma.”
 “Holy Mother, you only need to help me break through the power of the Heavenly Dao. Leave the rest to me. I won’t spread this matter. It has nothing to do with you.”
 The Holy Mother of Order was silent.
 The Divine Robe Daoist said, “Take it as the last time you help me. I won’t disturb your cultivation in the future.”
 The Holy Mother of Order said, “There’s a very strong Great Dao Sage hidden in the Heavenly Dao. I won’t help if you encounter a life and death crisis.”
 prepared.”
 “Mm.”
  The illusion shattered.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and still frowned. “I want to know if the Holy Mother of Order will help if I try to kill the Divine Robe Daoist?”
 (500 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [No]
 Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief.
 He might as well run if he had to face the Holy Mother of Order.
 It had to be said that these Transcendent mighty figures still had principles.
 “Will I die if the Divine Robe Daoist attacks the Heavenly Dao next?”
 (200 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [Only a slight possibility.]
 “How slight?”
 [If you don’t fight back.]
 Han Jue cursed silently. Was the system mocking him?
 He stood up and came to the 33rd Heaven.
 At this moment, the Sages were repairing the top of the Heavenly Dao and pouring providence into it. Han Jue wasn’t a Heavenly Dao Sage and couldn’t interfere.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du’s expression was solemn as he said, “At least a thousand years.”
 A thousand years!
 Han Jue frowned. So serious.
 It might not be only the Divine Robe Daoist who would attack in this period.
 Han Jue had no choice but to move Great Sage Void Soul out of the Hundred Peak Immortal River. He instructed, “In the future, stay here and protect the Heavenly Dao until it recovers.”
 Great Sage Void Soul had already returned to his original appearance, the black aura that refused to report.
 “Yes!”
 Great Sage Void Soul cupped his fists respectfully.
 Han Jue disappeared.
 The Sages looked at Great Sage Void Soul in surprise. Who was this person?
 Heavenly Venerate Wufa’s eyes suddenly widened and he said, “You’re Great Sage Void Soul? Aren’t you suppressed at the edge of the Chaos?”
 Great Sage Void Soul glanced at him and said, “Don’t mention the past.”
 Heavenly Venerate Wufa was shocked. He knew that he had said something wrong and hurriedly nodded.
 A smile appeared on his face. With Great Sage Void Soul around, the Heavenly Dao was even safer.
 Then, he sent a voice transmission to the other Sages.
 Knowing that Great Sage Void Soul was a Great Dao Sage, the Sages were very excited. At the same time, they were very curious about how Han Jue subdued him.
 Didn’t he always stay in the Heavenly Dao?
 Li Taigu stared at Great Sage Void Soul and had a bold thought.
 He wanted to spar with him and understand his strength.
 With Han Jue around, Great Sage Void Soul shouldn’t kill him. They could spar politely.
 However, he definitely couldn’t do it now. He had to protect the Heavenly Dao first.
 In the Daoist temple.
 He placed all existences above the Sages in the template into a simulation trial and fought all of them at once!
 One-on-one was no longer enough to satisfy Han Jue.
 He needed pressure.
 Only pressure could make people stronger. Han Jue still lost the first simulation trial.
 The simulation trial was different from reality. The opponent wouldn’t talk nonsense and would directly start fighting. In addition to his uneven methods, it was very difficult for Han Jue to withstand it.
 This was even more impressive than a hundred Ancestor Xitian. After all, the hundred Ancestor Xitian used the same method. He was facing different enemies and different Great Dao powers and methods.
 Continue!


 There were at least ten thousand such yellow leaves.
 Ten thousand yellow leaves later, a mighty figure advanced. These yellow leaves were not even as big as a grain of sand in front of him.
 It was the Divine Robe Daoist.
 The Divine Robe Daoist looked ahead and slowly walked forward.
 On his shoulder stood two figures.
 One of them was the Curse Fiendcelestial.
  The other was a woman.
 Her lower body was like smoke and her upper body was covered in armor. Her head looked very small, but her face was beautiful. Her eyes were dark and sharp. Overall, she looked extraordinary, but she exuded an extremely dangerous aura. The Curse Fiendcelestial couldn’t help but ask, “Deity, are you sure this trip is guaranteed? That Han Jue can’t be underestimated. He’s almost invincible among his peers.”
 “The Despair Dao Spirit suffered a loss because of arrogance. It’s not Fellow Daoist Divine Robe’s match.”
 The Curse Fiendcelestial frowned. The poisonous bugs on its face stopped and did not move.
 “Of course not…” the Curse Fiendcelestial replied. He knew that Han Jue’s potential was ridiculous, but it was impossible for him to reach the Great Dao Supreme Realm so quickly.
 Very few could successfully reach the Supreme Sage Realm even among the talented Great Dao Divine Spirits.
 A trace of hope appeared in the Curse Fiendcelestial’s heart.
 It would be best if the Divine Robe Daoist could kill Han Jue.
 The Curse Fiendcelestial was very heroic and felt that he could definitely kill Han Jue when he was born. He could also take advantage of Han Jue’s reckless cursing to rope in his subordinates.
 However, Divine Lord Peacock gave him a warning
 The Divine Robe Daoist smiled. “If you succeed, your people will live in the Heavenly Dao in the future. You will control the Heavenly Dao for me, but you still have to follow the rules.”
 The woman smiled. “Don’t worry. If the Heavenly Dao grows up, it won’t be good for me either.”
 The Curse Fiendcelestial was silent, but his heart was filled with jealousy.
 The expressions of the two people in front of him made him very unhappy. However, he had no choice but to bow his head.
 He would be on par with the Great Dao Divine Spirit one day!
 Wait, no!
 Outside the 33rd Heaven, in front of the Universal Hall.
 The Sages gathered here and were still working together to repair the Heavenly Dao.
 Not far away, Great Sage Void Soul suddenly opened his eyes and said, “They’re here. Two Great Dao Sages and a huge race.”
 His words shocked the Sages.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du immediately ordered, “All of you, send orders to the various providence sects to strictly guard the Chaotic City and the Chaotic Heavenly Road. Leave the repairing of the Heavenly Dao to me. All of you, guard your own areas!”
 “Yes!”
 The Sages immediately vanished.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du turned to look at Great Sage Void Soul and asked, “Are you confident?”
 Great Sage Void Soul snorted. Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du heaved a sigh of relief.
 It was good that the other party was confident
 Great Sage Void Soul said, “Of course not. How can I defeat two by myself?”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du’s face twitched. Even he, who had a stable Dao heart and excellent quality, almost wanted to curse.
 Why was this fellow so sarcastic?
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du couldn’t figure out how he had offended Great Sage Void Soul.
 For a time, the Immortal World surged. Some were terrified, some were nervous, some did not believe it, and some were excited.
 The excited were all geniuses or mighty figures.
 Heroes appeared in troubled times. If they wanted to leave their names in history forever, they had to kill their way out!
 “Finally!”
 “Fight for the Heavenly Dao without regrets. So the Divine Might Heavenly Sage had already expected this.”
 “It’s said that when the Flame Race and the Calamity Race attacked, the war was extremely cruel. The enemy this time will only be stronger.”
 “We cultivators have cultivated for thousands of years, isn’t it for such a battle? To prove the value of a lifetime. Fellow Daoists, let’s go to the edge of the Immortal World together!”
 “Good, good timing!”
 “Aren’t cultivators like us who haven’t even reached the Emperor Realm go just cannon fodder?”
 Han Jue was still in the simulation trial. He wouldn’t be insta-killed by the enemies in the simulation trial as he was covered in treasures. However, it was difficult to insta-kill the enemies.
 Han Jue still couldn’t do it even after thousands of battles.
 He ended the latest simulation trial and was about to enter another when he suddenly felt two powerful auras approaching the Heavenly Dao.
 Han Jue immediately used the simulation trial. The current system was far better than before and could already detect experts in the nearby domains outside the Heavenly Dao.
 [Divine Robe Daoist: Perfected Great Dao Primordial Chaos Realm, Great Dao Divine Spirit] (Hatred Concubine: Perfected Great Dao Primordial Chaos Realm, Transcendent Dao Expert]
 Two of them!
 Han Jue wasn’t in a hurry. After all, Great Sage Void Soul was outside.
 He would first enter a simulation trial to prevent a failure.
 He closed his eyes.
 Ten breaths later, he suddenly opened his eyes.
 “Damn it, what the hell!”
 Han Jue cursed again and entered the simulation trial again.
 Twenty breaths later.
 He opened his eyes and exhaled.
 Damn it.
 Fortunately, he had entered the simulation trial in advance. Otherwise, he would have failed.
 In the first battle, he was caught off guard by the Divine Robe Daoist’s mysterious Supreme Treasure and was severely injured. He couldn’t move his entire body and was so frightened that he immediately ended the simulation trial because it would be the same as the possibility that the system had deduced.
 In the second battle, he used the ability of the Substitution Fiendcelestial to dodge the attack of the mysterious Supreme Treasure. Then, he easily suppressed the Divine Robe Daoist.
 This Supreme Treasure could only be used
 once.
 Han Jue was secretly vigilant. He had to be like this in the future and not be reckless.
 Perhaps their cultivation realms were the same, but Dharma treasures were immeasurable.
 Han Jue guessed that this treasure was borrowed by the Divine Robe Daoist recently. If not for Han Jue’s prediction in advance, he might not have been killed, but the Heavenly Dao would definitely be destroyed. Once he was trapped, the enemy would be able to destroy the Heavenly Dao.
 Han Jue slowly stood up, his eyes filled with killing intent.
 The other party had a killing move, clearly targeting him!
  (300 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [No]
 Han Jue smiled and prepared to jump out of the Daoist temple. Then, he thought of something and paused. He asked in his mind, “Who is the strongest helper invited by the Divine Robe Daoist?”
 (300 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 300 billion years?
 Han Jue suddenly wanted to curse.
 This dog actually had a trump card!
