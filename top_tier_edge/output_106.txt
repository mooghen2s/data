 A hundred million years later.
 The blank domain became lively and colorful. It was no longer as pale as before. Countless worlds were distributed. From the Great Dao Supremes to the Zenith Heaven Golden Immortals, they were all creating worlds and adding a hint of vitality to the Endless Era.
 In a great world, in an inconspicuous small world among the billions of small worlds.
 Under the blue sky, green mountains rose and fell.
 Han Jue sat at the edge of the cliff halfway up the mountain. Fog filled the air ahead and the tall mountain opposite was faintly
 discernible.
 The Supreme Treasure on his body shed its divine light. He wore a white robe that fluttered in the wind. His gray hair fluttered in the air. His face was still young and handsome. Coupled with his gray hair, he could be said to have white hair and a youthful look. He had an immortal aura.
 “I wonder how long it will take to surpass the Creator Lord Realm. Fortunately, as I
 cultivate, my origin lifespan will continue to increase.”
 Han Jue opened his eyes and looked at the sky-covering fog ahead.
 Many changes occurred after the Endless Era began. All living beings only saw a truly endless world, and what he saw was the change in the basic rules of the blank domain.

 All living beings spread out a blank domain and countless tiny creations scattered, causing the basic rules to produce some new creations. For some creations, Han Jue needed some time to understand.
 Perhaps this was a self-defense ability of the blank domain, just like the Primordial Fiendcelestial and the Ninth Chaos. It would
 subconsciously create trouble for the
 invincible and push for its development.
 Han Jue could only control the basic rules now
 and couldn’t truly own them. True
 domination was that he could create and
 destroy them at will.
 Of course, it was acceptable to relax occasionally.
 Just like now.
 “Hahaha! I know how to control a sword!”
 A slightly childish laugh sounded. A youth flew out of the mist on a wooden sword. He wore clothes made of brown beast skin and had a slightly dark face. He looked to be fourteen or fifteen years old, but his facial features were sharp and bright.
 The youth stood on the wooden sword and swayed as if he would fall at any moment.
 Han Jue looked at him and smiled.
 “After ten thousand years, this kid’s
 personality is always like this in every life. It’s interesting. It seems that even the Fusang Tree’s Space-time Reincarnation can’t erase his nature. The Primordial Fiendcelestial’s nature is still powerful.”
 Han Jue looked at the youth and thought
 silently.
 The youth’s name in this life was Chu Xiaoqi. He was born into an ordinary family in the mortal world. Because he was the seventh and
 youngest, he was given the name Xiaoqi by his parents.
 Chu Xiaoqi had yearned to cultivate since he
 was young, so he ran away from home when he was thirteen and wandered the world. In the end, it was naturally very bleak. First, his luggage was snatched by bandits, and later, he almost died in the mouth of a beast. He stumbled and wandered for a year. When he was being hunted down by a certain spirit monster, he fell off a cliff and met Han Jue, an ‘immortal’.
 The two of them had already interacted for
 half a year. Han Jue taught Chu Xiaoqi the basic cultivation technique and the flying
 Most of Chu Xiaoqi’s previous ten thousand
 lifetimes were mortals. He had lived mediocre
 lives and had also cultivated. The highest he had reached was the Pseudo-Sage Realm. He had just stepped into the Pseudo-Sage Realm when he was surrounded and killed by his enemies. This matter was still discussed by his descendants in that world. Of course, it was not a good story, but a joke.
 Han Jue found it funny. He could clearly lie down, but he insisted on kneeling. He supported himself with both hands and stuck out his tongue like a dog.
 However, this posture was somewhat similar
 to Primordial Despair.
 Han Jue didn’t appear in Chu Xiaoqi’s life in
 the previous reincarnations. This was the first
 time.
 “Immortal, how long can your flying sword technique last?
 “It must be a long time. Are you a Golden Core cultivator?
 “Legend has it that Golden Core cultivators
 can fly.
 “How long have you been here? “Ah! I’m so hungry. Immortal, can you make a roasted chicken for me? I’m too tired and don’t want to hunt by myself. I don’t want to fast yet.” Chu Xiaoqi chattered non-stop. He was
 clearly tired, but he refused to shut up.
 Han Jue smiled and didn’t say anything. He waved his right hand, and a fragrant roasted chicken appeared in front of the kid. Chu Xiaoqi’s eyes lit up. He immediately became lively and began to tear the roasted
 chicken apart.
 Han Jue wanted to refuse and let Chu Xiaoqi rely on himself, but his heart softened. Strangely, he couldn’t be bothered by his
 children’s suffering. Instead, he doted on his reincarnated grandson.
 he was born. Even before he died, he was very
 puzzled that his father did not help him.
 After Chu Xiaoqi was full, he lay on the ground and stretched. Then, he continued to chatter and fell asleep.
 Han Jue waved his hand, and a white robe covered Chu Xiaoqi.
 He closed his eyes again and continued cultivating.
 Two years later.
 Chu Xiaoqi had successfully reached the Foundation Establishment realm and his body was much stronger. He was flying on his sword in the mountains and plains. He kept casting spells with both hands and chased
 after a bird demon.
 The bird demon was like a golden eagle. Its
 feathers were golden and its wingspan was ten feet wide.
 Chu Xiaoqi’s spells landed on the bird demon, causing its feathers to fly and blood to flow.
 In the end, the bird demon’s wings were broken. With a cry, it fell into the cliff.
 Chu Xiaoqi took out a rope. It was a piece of equipment that stretched out at will and tied the bird demon into a ball. Then, he carried it and landed in front of Han Jue. “Hehe, Grandpa, am I powerful?” Chu Xiaoqi smiled proudly. He placed his hands on his hips and looked extremely arrogant.
 He called him grandpa because Han Jue didn’t
 want to have a master-disciple relationship with him, and he couldn’t always call him an immortal.
 “Not bad,” Han Jue said without opening his
 eyes.
 Chu Xiaoqi curled his lips and began to deal with the bird demon. After a while, in order to survive, the bird demon acknowledged Chu Xiaoqi as its master and was named Chu
 Xiaoniao.
 Han Jue’s face twitched upon hearing this
 name.
 Night fell.
 Chu Xiaoqi hesitated as he sat beside him.
 eyes.
 Why was he in this mortal world? “Grandpa, I want to go home and take a look.
 Can I?” Chu Xiaoqi asked softly. This immortal had taught him for so long, but
 he didn’t ask for anything in return. Therefore, he felt that he would let the
 immortal down by leaving.
 What if the immortal did not agree? “Yes, of course.”
 Han Jue’s answer stunned Chu Xiaoqi. He had thought of all sorts of answers but didn’t expect the other party to agree so casually.


 “You agreed? Don’t worry, I’ll definitely return to be filial to you!”
 Chu Xiaoqi was very excited and spoke respectfully. He had always been rude in the past.
 Han Jue smiled and nodded.
 Chu Xiaoqi decided to return after dawn. He was very excited tonight. He looked forward to returning home. He wanted to prove to his family that his choice was not wrong. He was not daydreaming or possessed!
 !!
 That night, Chu Xiaoqi struggled until almost dawn and only woke up at noon.
 Chu Xiaoqi kowtowed before leaving. Han Jue kept his eyes closed and continued cultivating, ignoring him.
 For some reason, Chu Xiaoqi’s heart ached.
 Grandfather was definitely the person who treated him the best. He was even better than his parents. At home, he had too many
 siblings. His parents were busy making a living and did not dote on him much. Some of his elder brothers even bullied him.
 Chu Xiaoqi walked to the edge of the cliff and prepared to ride his sword. He couldn’t help but turn his head and say, “Grandpa, do you want to walk with me?”
 He was filled with anticipation, but he knew that it was impossible.
 How could immortals be so easy?
 “Alright!” Han Jue replied and stood up.
 Chu Xiaoqi’s eyes widened in disbelief.
 “Really?”
 “Yes.”
 “Don’t you want to cultivate?”
 “The world is vast. I can cultivate anywhere.” “Great!”
 Chu Xiaoqi was extremely excited. He also wanted to introduce Han Jue to his family.
 Han Jue let Chu Xiaoqi fly on his sword while he rode a cloud. He sat on the cloud and continued cultivating.
 “Damn, Grandpa, why didn’t you teach me this move?”
 Chu Xiaoqi’s eyes widened again and shouted.
 This kid always liked to glare, making Han Jue feel he was very similar to the
 hot-blooded male protagonists he had seen in his previous life.
 times when he was weak. It was just that humans were like this. The other races were not like this.
 The nature of humans was to value
 relationships, no matter what.
 himself from this. He was him. He wanted to be himself and not try to be like other
 existences.
 Along the way, Chu Xiaoqi became talkative again.
 “Grandpa, do you have family?”
 “Yes.”
 “Where are they?”
 “They’re very, very far away. So far that you
 might never reach them in your lifetime.”
 “Ah, this… Sorry.”
 “Hehe.”
 Chu Xiaoqi thought that Han Jue’s family was all dead and knew that he had said something wrong. He hurriedly changed the topic.
 He began to introduce his family. Actually, he did not like his family much. He just wanted to go back and prove himself.
 Chu Xiaoqi kept talking, and Han Jue listened
 silently.
 The two of them flew to the horizon together. Chu Xiaoqi’s carefree laughter echoed in the
 sky.
 Figures gathered in a vast palace. The weakest was a Pseudo-Sage. Standing at the front were three Primordial Chaos Sages.
 Their eyes were filled with reverence as they looked in one direction.
 In front of them sat a figure in the position of
 the master of this world. It was Huang
 Zuntian.
 Huang Zuntian obtained a Great Creation
 after the Great Dao Immeasurable Calami ended. The name of the Primordial Fiendcelestial shocked the Endless Era. His cultivation level was considered top-notch below the Dao Creator Realm.
 The living beings present did not know his
 identity. The difference in status was too great and they were not qualified to know. However, Huang Zuntian was too strong. Just the pressure was enough to make Sages lose their will to resist.
 The World Lord was a gray-robed Daoist. He frowned and asked, “Senior, did you find what you wanted?”
 Huang Zuntian opened his eyes. In an instant,
 everyone in the hall lowered their heads, not daring to look at him.
 “No, but perhaps in the future. All of you, help me pay attention. One day, a talented person will appear in this world. He is bloodthirsty and will bring calamity to all living beings. It’s not only your world. If that
 With that, Huang Zuntian vanished. A black
 token floated above the throne. A strange figure was carved on it.
 Everyone looked at each other. Huang Zuntian leaving just like that made them heave a sigh
 of relief, but his words cast a shadow on everyone’s hearts.
 This world was about to face a calamity?
 They couldn’t deduce it, but they didn’t dare to ignore Huang Zuntian’s words.
 Chu Xiaoqi’s home was in a town. The nearest
 city was a hundred miles away. Most of the people in this town hunted and fished for a living.
 Han Jue followed Chu Xiaoqi home after entering the town.
 Chu Xiaoqi’s parents were already fifty years
 old. His father had a hunched back and held a
 walking stick. He looked ten years older than his actual age. His parents were very excited to see Chu
 Xiaoqi. His mother cried in joy, but in less
 than ten breaths of time, his father began to chase after her. The two sisters at home also came out and were very surprised by his
 return. As for the three brothers, they were still hunting in the forest.
 After a while, Chu Xiaoqi introduced Han Jue
 to his family. Their eyes locked on him the moment they saw him. Han Jue had white hair, but his face was extremely young. They had never seen such a handsome man. Chu Xiaoqi’s two sisters were so shy that they blushed and didn’t dare to stare at him. “Thank you for saving him, Immortal…” Chu Xiaoqi’s father, Chu Dazhu, said with a trembling voice. He didn’t believe that Han
 Jue was an immortal, but he had saved his son, after all.
 Chu Xiaoqi suddenly leaped, and a wooden sword appeared under his feet. He began to circle above the courtyard and cried out, attracting the attention of his neighbors.
 Chu Dazhu and the others were dumbfounded in disbelief.
 The neighbors exclaimed.
 Han Jue looked at Chu Xiaoqi with a smile.
 This was how youth should be.
 He’s really unlike me, but very similar to his
 father.
 Soon, even the mayor was alarmed. The news
 Even Han Jue was sought after. He wasn’t angry at their enthusiasm. Fortunately, Chu Xiaoqi was not a fool and asked his mother to
 arrange a room for Han Jue to cultivate in and stay away from trouble.
 Han Jue hid in the room and started
 cultivating.
 In the evening, Chu Xiaoqi’s three brothers
 returned. They were shocked to know that he had succeeded in seeking immortality. That night, they knelt in front of Han Jue’s house and wanted to acknowledge him as their master, but he rejected them.
 In the following days, Chu Xiaoqi publicized his spells everywhere, causing the entire town to be extremely lively. He even alerted the
 nearby cities, and the City Lord personally came to receive the immortals. Han Jue didn’t appear, but Chu Xiaoqi handled
 it well. The City Lord even wanted to marry his daughter to him. Such a fast pace made
 Chu Xiaoqi realize the influence of cultivation on mortals.
 She also wants to get close to me. I’m so angry. She’s not as good-looking as the little flower in town. With her figure, tsk tsk…”
 A wretched smile appeared on his face as he spoke.


 Facing Chu Xiaoqi, who was smiling like a pig, Han Jue asked, “Then, are you willing to marry Xiaohua?”
 Like young girls, it was normal for youths to yearn for love.
 Chu Xiaoqi scratched his head. “How can I cultivate if I get married? In the future, won’t I have to help her cultivate? If her potential is not good, she might even drag me down and distract me. No, I shouldn’t get married. There are many beauties in this world.”
 Han Jue chuckled. “You just like her beauty?”
 !!
 “Nonsense. I haven’t even interacted much with them. How can I fall in love with them at first sight?”
 “As long as you’re happy.”
 “Grandpa, how did you get married back then?” Chu Xiaoqi sat beside Han Jue and asked curiously.
 Han Jue smiled. “Back then, I was a herb garden servant and an outer disciple of a cultivation sect. I happened to meet a female cultivator…”
 He told the story of him and Xing Hongxuan. Xing Hongxuan was a spy, but she met Han Jue by chance and fell in love with him at first sight. After that, she pestered him every day. She also repeatedly gave him treasures. Such a story fascinated Chu Xiaoqi.
 He had always heard that men chased after women, but it was rare for women to chase after men.
 He couldn’t help but look at Han Jue. Such looks were indeed liked by girls. Even his two sisters secretly asked him about Han Jue.
 Chu Xiaoqi suddenly clapped his hands and said in shock, “I’ve decided. I can’t marry easily in the future. I want beauties to pursue me. I’ll marry whoever is the most sincere!”
 Han Jue found it funny and didn’t discourage him.
 Who could say for sure about the future?
 Han Jue could see the future, but he wouldn’t look easily. That would make things meaningless. He only needed to be vigilant and wary of the future. As long as there was a possibility that the future threatened him, he would check it. He had such foresight as the Creator Lord.
 Of course, he still had to take the time to check his fate every once in a while.
 “Grandpa, aren’t you curious about my other brother?” Chu Xiaoqi changed the topic.
 Currently, other than Chu Xiaoqi, there were two sisters and three brothers in the family. They were still missing one.
 Chu Xiaoqi chuckled. “I want to cultivate because of my big brother. I’ve never seen him since I was young. He also went out to search for immortals when he was very young and never returned. A few years ago, he replied that he had joined the Darkness Sect. We all thought that he had been deceived.”
 Darkness Sect…
 Han Jue was not surprised to hear this name.
 The Darkness Sect collapsed and began to disperse after the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity ended. The Dao Creators didn’t kill all their members because Han Jue had told the Formless Transcendent Deity that there was white and there was black. If he killed the Darkness Sect, other sects would appear. It was better to keep the remaining members pave the way for another Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity in the future.
 and
 Instead of choosing the disciples of the various families, it was better to let the evil descendants continue to be evil.
 Of course, Han Jue was still thinking for Shi Dudao, Jing Tiangong, and the others. The Formless Transcendent Deity also felt that it made sense.
 Many mighty figures of the Darkness Sect
 were killed. Only a few people related to Han
 Jue survived.
 From this point of view, Han Jue was very selfish.
 But so what if he was selfish?
 He was the strongest. He decided everything.
 Who had the right to blame him?
 It was only a rule set to protect the same level
 of benefits.
 Chu Xiaoqi told Han Jue about his brother for a while and only left late at night.
 Chu Xiaoqi was still glorious in the following
 days. He didn’t even have time to cultivate. He either helped the hunters kill spirits and beasts or taught the children in the town to cultivate.
 Han Jue didn’t stop him. He would occasionally go out for a walk. At first, the people were surprised by his appearance, but later, they got used to it.
 In the blink of an eye, half a year passed.
 Chu Xiaoqi found Han Jue again and said, “Grandpa, I want to cultivate. Let’s leave.”
 Han Jue didn’t even open his eyes. “Should we part for now or forever?”
 Chu Xiaoqi was stunned.
 He fell silent and then understood what Han
 Jue meant.
 a cultivator. His family did not have the
 potential to cultivate. If he stayed, not only would it delay him, but he might also cause trouble for his family in the future. There was also the parting of life and death. It
 was even more exciting.
 After a long while…
 Chu Xiaoqi clenched his fists. “Forever.”
 …
 At dawn.
 Chu Xiaoqi left a letter. Before leaving the
 town, he even went to see Xiaohua. In the
 end, he severed his mortal thoughts and left with Han Jue.
 “Grandpa, should we go back and cultivate?”
 “I don’t have to go back. I can walk around.”
 “Alright! I also want to see if the world is
 exciting. Do the cultivation sects you mentioned really exist?”
 “Do you want to join a sect? It’s a good opportunity to train.”
 “What will happen to you, then?”
 “I’ll find a place nearby to hide and cultivate.”
 “Wuwuwu. Grandpa, you’re the best! I’m so touched that I’m crying! I’ll kidnap a beautiful nun for you when I join the sect.
 She’s definitely the most beautiful fairy in the
 sect!”
 “Hehe.”
 One rode a cloud and the other on a sword.
 They flew side by side and laughed as they flew towards the horizon. Three months later, they came to a cultivation
 sect. Han Jue asked Chu Xiaoqi to join them while he opened a cave abode in the nearby forest.
 “I’ll only teach you cultivation. I won’t
 interfere if you encounter danger. You have to rely on yourself.’
 Han Jue warned him before leaving.
 Han Jue couldn’t help but look at Chu Xiaoqi
 as he sat in the cave abode.
 Chu Xiaoqi was already at the Foundation Establishment realm, so it was naturally not difficult for him to enter the sect. The most powerful expert of this sect, the sect master, was only at the Soul Formation realm.
 Qi Refinement, Foundation Establishment, Golden Core, Nascent Soul, Soul Formation, Void Amalgamation, Fusion, Tribulation Transcendence, Mahayana…
 Han Jue couldn’t help but recall his cultivation years.
 Chu Xiaoqi first became an outer sect disciple. With his cheerful personality, he quickly made a group of good friends. The cultivation technique Han Jue taught him was stronger than the cultivation techniques in the mortal world. Therefore, in less than
 three years, Chu Xiaoqi passed the inner sect assessment and was chosen by an elder.
 The elder was very curious about his cultivation technique, but everyone had their own opportunities, so he did not force him to
 hand it over.
 Chu Xiaoqi began to encounter trouble after
 entering the inner sect. One of his brothers
 had his Dao Companion snatched by a genius. Later, he was murdered while training outside. Chu Xiaoqi was furious and also became enemies with that prodigy. This prodigy was the personal disciple of the
 Sect Master, but Han Jue could tell that he was actually an illegitimate son.
 On the surface, the Sect Master did not care
 about this matter, but if it really reached the point of no return, Chu Xiaoqi would definitely die.
 Han Jue looked forward to Chu Xiaoqi’s next performance.
 ‘Grandpa! Someone wants to kill me. Save me!”
 Chu Xiaoqi came to visit Han Jue and cried on
 his lap. He was clearly grown up, but he was
 deliberately acting like a child.
 Han Jue could clearly tell that this kid was not really crying. He was just pretending. Furthermore, no one was chasing after him.


 “That’s good. Just die.”
 Han Jue stroked Chu Xiaoqi’s head and smiled benevolently, startling him so much that he suddenly looked up.
 No tears could be seen on this kid’s face. He pretended not to care at all.
 Chu Xiaoqi said aggrievedly, “Who will be filial to you if I die? You’ve nurtured me for so many years. You definitely won’t let me die casually.”
 “Not necessarily. I’ve taught countless disciples.”
 “Wow, Grandpa, what’s your cultivation level? Are you like our Sect Master? No, no one noticed you hiding here. Your cultivation level is definitely stronger than our Sect Master.”
 “My cultivation has nothing to do with you. Cultivate well. This hatred has nothing to do with you. Why get involved?”
 “That won’t do. In life, you have to dare to love and hate. He killed my brother. I hate him. I have to kill him!” Chu Xiaoqi said indignantly. His expression turned sinister, inadvertently showing a hint of Primordial Despair.
 Han Jue smiled. “Then kill him. Don’t look for me.”
 “I can’t. Grandpa, teach me a spell. I can’t defeat him with my current strength!”
 Chu Xiaoqi stood up and started to massage Han Jue’s shoulders and back. His expression was fawning, and he didn’t care about his reputation at all.
 Han Jue enjoyed it and smiled. “Then, I’ll teach you a Mystical Power.”
 “Mystical Power?”
 Chu Xiaoqi’s body shook. He had heard of Mystical Powers after joining the sect. They
 appeared in ancient books. They were
 superior to spells and could only be learned by immortals.
 Han Jue smiled and said, “This is the Heavenly Punishment Ghost Deity Sword. With one strike, it can shock the world and make ghosts and gods weep. Don’t use it unless you are in a desperate situation.” Heavenly Punishment Ghost Deity Sword!
 Chu Xiaoqi’s eyes widened. He immediately knelt down and started to kowtow, thanking Han Jue for his guidance.
 Han Jue used the barrier and made the space in the cave abode a hundred miles wide, making it convenient for Chu Xiaoqi to
 cultivate her Mystical Power. Chu Xiaoqi was shocked. Han Jue’s image in his heart
 increased infinitely.
 It seemed that he had still underestimated his
 grandfather.
 Could he really be an immortal?!
 Several months later.
 Under Chu Xiaoqi’s relentless cultivation, he
 finally learned the Heavenly Punishment Ghost Deity Sword. The world-shattering power made him unable to stop and his blood
 boiled.
 Chu Xiaoqi left excitedly after cultivating the Mystical Power. Han Jue also continued
 cultivating.
 Han Jue enjoyed his current life. There was less fighting and killing. Participating in the lives of others was also a form of training and
 a feeling.
 Dao spells that the disciples of the sect could learn. His reputation could be said to have risen greatly. Even the Sect Master had personally received him.
 Chu Xiaoqi did not act recklessly. Facing the prodigy of the enemy, he did not argue and
 kept looking for an opportunity.
 all. As long as they did not betray the sect, the sect only valued cultivation and potential. Han Jue paid attention to Chu Xiaoqi as he cultivated.
 Chu Xiaoqi would visit him every once in a
 while. Other than him, no one else knew of Han Jue’s existence.
 Chu Xiaoqi was also puzzled. Was this place really difficult to find?
 However, as his cultivation level increased, he
 realized that it might be because his grandfather had allowed him to find it.
 Ten years later.
 Chu Xiaoqi was outside killing the prodigy.
 Because other fellow disciples saw it, the news quickly spread to the sect. The sect
 master was furious and issued a kill order. For
 a time, Chu Xiaoqi fled in all directions in a sorry state.
 He didn’t even have a chance to go back and
 taken good care of her, and it was all thanks
 to her seducing that prodigy that he managed to kill him.
 In the mountains, Chu Xiaoqi flew on his
 handsome face and cold eyes. He had the aura of a sword immortal. Behind him was a young woman with an oval face and a sweet
 appearance. She gently held Chu Xiaoqi’s
 waist.
 Tang Wan leaned her head on Chu Xiaoqi’s back and whispered, “Brother Xiaoqi, where are we going… Where can we escape to…
 Chu Xiaoqi replied, “I’ll find a place to settle you down and find an elder of mine. He can protect us.”
 “Why don’t you go directly?”
 “He’s still in the sect.”
 Tang Wan was silent. She thought that Chu
 Xiaoqi’s elder was a sect elder.
 Master?
 At this moment, a sword Qi crossed
 mountains and rivers, devouring ten thousand miles.
 Chu Xiaoqi subconsciously turned around.
 That sword Qi was too fast. He couldn’t dodge
 in time.
 Boom-
 They were overturned by the sword Qi and fell
 to the ground.
 If not for Chu Xiaoqi twisting the flying sword
 in time, the two of them would have been instantly crushed.
 Chu Xiaoqi wanted to hug Tang Wan, but a talisman landed on him. Lightning interwove and he could not move.
 He watched as Tang Wan fell into the forest.
 His eyes instantly turned red. “Damn it!”
 Chu Xiaoqi fell onto the cliff outside the
 forest. He felt that his body was about to fall apart. He had fallen from a thousand meters in the air and was even injured. He couldn’t take it even with his Golden Core cultivation. A figure slowly descended and landed above Chu Xiaoqi. This person wore a green robe and a jade crown. He held a horsetail whisk and a blade appeared in it.
 “Chu Xiaoqi, you harmed your fellow
 disciples. You must die,” the green-robed Daoist said expressionlessly. He looked down
 at Chu Xiaoqi with an extremely indifferent
 gaze.
 Chu Xiaoqi got up with difficulty and wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth. The
 talisman on his body turned into dust and dissipated.
 He first used his divine sense to find Tang Wan and discovered that she was lying in a grass patch. She was covered in blood and her
 body was covered in branches. She looked extremely miserable and appeared dead. “Then why didn’t you kill me?” Chu Xiaoqi asked. He tried his best to calm down. The green-robed Daoist narrowed his eyes. “Hand over your cultivation technique and Mystical Power. I can let you die a quick death. If the Sect Master catches you, you will definitely beg for death. He will extract
 your
 soul and sacrifice your Dharma treasure so you can never reincarnate.”
 that
 Chu Xiaoqi grinned. “You want to learn?
 at the Nascent Soul realm. Don’t play tricks.
 I’ll save that woman first, but if you dare to
 Chu Xiaoqi ignored him and walked towards the forest to check on Tang Wan.
 At the same time, on a cliff a hundred miles
 away.
 Han Jue stood at the edge of the cliff looking
 at this scene. He didn’t move. The green-robed Daoist and Chu Xiaoqi didn’t
 sense his existence.


 Chu Xiaoqi’s cultivation technique was only casually created by Han Jue, but in the mortal world, it was definitely a top-notch
 The green-robed Daoist cultivated for several days but failed.
 He was not in a hurry.
 Not far away, by a small river, Chu Xiaoqi was helping Tang Wan clean the wound on her
 back. Tang Wan covered her chest with her clothes. Her originally snow-white back was covered in crisscrossing scars. It was a ghastly sight.
 “Are we going to surrender just like that?”
 “Let’s wait and see. His cultivation level is too
 high. We can’t resist.”
 “Isn’t your Mystical Power able to cross realms to kill enemies?”
 “I was bragging to you. It’s fine to cross two
 minor realms, but the other party is a Nascent Soul realm cultivator.”
 “Fine.”
 The two of them fell silent, each thinking about something.
 Chu Xiaoqi felt bitter. I wonder how Grandpa is. Oh Grandpa, your grandson is about to die.
 In Chu Xiaoqi’s opinion, as long as his grandfather took action, this Nascent Soul cultivator would definitely die. However, this place was too far from his grandfather’s cave abode. His grandfather would definitely not be able to save him in time.
 No!
 He had to think of a way to save himself!
 Chu Xiaoqi thought silently and began to think of a way.
 He couldn’t win. He could only scheme.
 How to be sinister was another problem.
 In the evening, the green-robed Daoist called him. It turned out that the green-robed Daoist felt that this cultivation technique was too difficult and needed his help.
 Chu Xiaoqi was overjoyed. There was a way!
 He began to mess with some of the steps of the cultivation technique. To prevent himself from being discovered, he modified it bit by bit.
 The green-robed Daoist was stunned by the profoundness of this cultivation technique. There were too many questions, so he did not notice the details.
 A hundred miles away.
 Han Jue laughed as he saw through Chu Xiaoqi’s tricks. This kid was really dramatic.
 Since he had nothing to do, Han Jue decided to draw a Creation Heaven’s Chosen.
 He accumulated the Creation Heaven’s Chosen every ten million years. Now, he had accumulated 46 attempts.
 [Activating the Creation Heaven’s Chosen. A
 random Great Creation will appear among
 your descendants.]
 [Your descendant Chen Jue has awakened an Innate Great Creation-Unparalleled Dharma
 Star]
 [Unparalleled Dharma Star: Innate Great Creation. It can allow one’s Dharmic powers
 to be endless and never dry up.]
 His Dharmic powers were endless. It was not bad, but it could only be said to be good in the
 early stages. When his cultivation level reached a certain realm, it could also have such an effect.
 He silently deduced that Chen Jue was a
 straight line distance away from this world formed by ten million Chaos. It seemed that it would be very difficult for him to encounter Chu Xiaoqi in this life.
 This time, Han Jue didn’t plan to nurture the Creation Heaven’s Chosen and let Chen Jue let nature take its course.
 He would draw and unleash a huge explosion when he gathered a hundred attempts. Then, he would gather them all and nurture them into his Creator Lord’s Army! There were still 55 attempts left to accumulate. He had to wait for 550 million years to pass.
 Han Jue’s gaze landed on Chu Xiaoqi again.
 How many times would Chu Xiaoqi reincarnate in the next five hundred million
 years?
 However, Han Jue couldn’t bear it as he looked at him.
 Forget it. He had reincarnated enough. It was
 time to escape the pain of reincarnation.
 Han Jue smiled and closed his eyes.
 …
 Two months later.
 Under Chu Xiaoqi’s schemes, the green-robed Daoist’s cultivation state became more and more amiss. He realized that something was
 wrong and immediately found trouble with Chu Xiaoqi, threatening him.
 Chu Xiaoqi knelt down without any backbone.
 He was terrified and tears and snot flowed
 down his face. Tang Wan saw this scene, making the green-robed Daoist feel that he was not faking it. After all, men cared about
 their reputation. He had to put down his worries.
 He had no choice. He had been stuck at the
 Another month passed. The green-robed
 Daoist developed a mental demon. A murderous aura surrounded his brows like a
 demon.
 He found Chu Xiaoqi again. This time, he even
 cast a spell to torture him. Chu Xiaoqi cried that he had also cultivated like this. This
 time, Chu Xiaoqi even peed. His pants were drenched and he had no dignity. The green-robed Daoist’s suspicion increased.
 Could it be that their cultivation techniques conflicted?
 He was really unwilling to give up just like
 that.
 What would happen in the future if he missed
 this opportunity?
 No!
 He couldn’t listen blindly.
 The green-robed Daoist’s eyes turned ruthless. He stopped Chu Xiaoqi and began to
 use his secret technique. He split a portion
 his soul and possessed him, occupying his
 memories!
 After Chu Xiaoqi was frozen, he knew that something was wrong.
 He despaired.
 Damn it.

 After acting for so long and losing all his face
 in front of Tang Wan, he still couldn’t
 escape
 death… If he had known earlier, he would have fought head-on and died with dignity.
 Tang Wan drew her sword and stabbed at the
 green-robed Daoist’s back. However, she was sent flying by his Dharmic powers and
 vomited blood before fainting on the ground. Foundation Establishment realm cultivators could not withstand a single blow from a Nascent Soul realm cultivator. The green-robed Daoist’s eyes emitted a green light. His soul flew out and entered the
 space between Chu Xiaoqi’s eyebrows. In an instant, Chu Xiaoqi was stunned. His shoulders drooped and he lost consciousness. Several breaths later, the green-robed Daoist trembled. His eyes widened and he said with a
 trembling voice, “What is it!” Boom-
 The green-robed Daoist’s body exploded,
 along with his Nascent Soul. His soul dissipated into the world. Chu Xiaoqi fell to the ground. Wisps of blood
 Qi appeared and condensed into a terrifying shadow. It was Primordial Despair. However, the shadow quickly dissipated as if it had never been there.
 A hundred miles away. Another person appeared beside Han Jue. It
 was Xing Hongxuan.
 “It’s really him.”
 Xing Hongxuan clicked her tongue in wonder.
 Half a month ago, she was bored and visited Han Jue. She wanted to go out and travel together, so Han Jue moved her to this world.
 Han Jue didn’t hide anything from her.
 Xing Hongxuan was enlightened. No wonder Primordial Despair gave her a strange feeling. Han Jue didn’t kill him after that. So that was the case.
 Han Jue smiled. “It’s more interesting if it’s different.”
 “Yes, let’s spend ten thousand years
 “Tsk tsk, I didn’t expect you to like your descendants across so many generations. In that case, I’ll wander around the vicinity for a
 time.”
 Xing Hongxuan covered her mouth and
 laughed. Han Jue had no objections, and the two of them parted for the time being. Han Jue approached Chu Xiaoqi and waved his
 right hand. He changed his clothes and sat by the river to cultivate. Two hours later.
 sword and prepared to fight. Han Jue ignored her. Tang Wan didn’t dare to
 act rashly. She hurriedly came to Chu Xiaoqi’s
 side and checked his condition.
 Chu Xiaoqi also woke up as she checked on
 him.
 The moment this kid woke up, he screamed and cursed the green-robed Daoist. Like a despicable trader in the market, he used all sorts of dirty words.
 He was pleasantly surprised to see Han Jue. He pushed Tang Wan away and pounced in front of him, wailing. “Grandpa, you’re finally here! You have to avenge me! I was
 tortured by him!”
