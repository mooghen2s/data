 Han Jue sized up his youngest daughter again.
 She was really like him.
 Be it appearance or personality.
 Han Jue suddenly felt that he had a successor. Han Huang had never given him such a feeling
 “I have to nurture her well. Ling’er will deal with them if the little fellows outside dare to rebel.”
 Han Jue smiled when he thought of this.
 Han Ling asked, “Father, can you bring me to the Chaotic Assembly? Although I’m not participating, I also want to see the strength of the Chaotic geniuses.”
 Han Jue nodded and brought his other wives and children to watch the battle.
 The father and daughter chatted for a while before Han Jue started to check his emails.
 As the Chaotic Assembly approached, the battles in his circle of friends began to increase. Most of them were attacked and were rarely severely injured. They were probably sparring.
 Then, Han Jue’s gaze landed on the Ultimate Origin World in the depths of his soul.
 The first Chaotic Fiendcelestial, the Life Fiendcelestial, had already attained the Dao. The Ultimate Origin World was higher than the previous Primordial Chaos and Chaos. There was no way to create living beings for the time being even if the Life Fiendcelestial attained the Dao.
 It couldn’t figure out how to create them.
 It was mainly because it was ignorant.
 The reason why it wanted to create living beings was that it felt lonely.
 Han Jue thought for a moment and sent a wisp of his will into the Ultimate Origin World.
 At this moment, the Life Fiendcelestial was cultivating on a planet with an ocean, land, mountains, and trees.
 The Life Fiendcelestial’s body was larger than a mountain. Sitting in the mountains, every breath would stir up a terrifying peak and shake the forest. It was like a snake with three heads. The head in the middle looked like a man with fierce eyes and eyebrows. The heads on both sides looked like women. Its facial features were demonic and its long hair fluttered.
 A figure emitting a dazzling divine light appeared in front of the Life Fiendcelestial’s middle head. It was Han Jue.
 The Life Fiendcelestial opened its eyes and stared at him.
 No battles occurred in the Ultimate Origin World for the time being, so the Life Fiendcelestial was not afraid. It was only puzzled.
 It couldn’t sense Han Jue’s aura.
 Han Jue smiled and asked, “What are you confused about?”
 The Life Fiendcelestial said, “I want to create existences like me… The more, the better, but I can’t succeed…”
 It had to be said that the Chaotic Fiendcelestial was extremely simple. Facing the mysterious Han Jue, it also told him the truth.
 Han Jue smiled and said, “I have a way. You need to use the power of creation…”
 To the Chaotic Fiendcelestials, the Ultimate Origin World was endless. However, such a huge world was filled with loneliness, making cultivation meaningless. Other than cultivating, most Chaotic Fiendcelestials were in a daze. In their respective domains, they looked up at the same lonely Ultimate Origin Universe.
 After a long while…
 Han Jue quietly disappeared and the Life Fiendcelestial fell into an epiphany.
 Han Jue opened his eyes.
 He couldn’t help but sigh. He didn’t expect that he would have to personally push the development process.
 Currently, although the Ultimate Origin Qi in the Ultimate Origin World was increasing, it was far inferior to 1% of the nebulous Primordial Qi.
 Chaos, Sword Dao River, in the pale space-time.
 A river formed by sword Qi flowed away, never to return.
 With his hands behind his waist, his robes fluttered with the sword Qi.
 A figure appeared in the distance and also stood on the Sword Dao River. It was Laozi.
 Laozi stared at Li Daokong and said, “What a powerful Sword Dao will. You’ve just entered the Great Dao and actually have such strength.”
 Li Daokong looked at him and said, “Grandmaster, long time no see.”
 Laozi said calmly, “I’m not your Grandmaster. You’re already Teacher’s successor. In terms of seniority, we should be of the same generation.”
 Laozi’s expression changed slightly. “You can feel it?”
 Laozi was silent.
 Li Daokong clenched his right hand and the golden river dissipated. He turned around and said, “Grandmaster, it seems that you have desires, after all. There’s actually another Heavenly Dao hidden in the Sword Dao River, an even stronger Heavenly Dao. No wonder your cultivation is so powerful. It can draw the power of all living beings’ faith. Impressive.”
 His figure turned into stars and dissipated without waiting for Laozi to answer.
 His last words echoed in the Sword Dao River.
 “Grandmaster, although you created the Sword Dao, I will surpass you. I will challenge you when I reach the Supreme Realm. At that time, it will not only be a battle between us, but also a battle between two Sword Dao rivers.”
 Laozi did not stop Li Daokong from leaving.
 His gaze landed on the vast Sword Dao River below and he muttered, “Sword Dao? That’s just your narrow definition.”
 In a huge palace, two rows of stone pillars surrounded by fire dragons illuminated the hall.
 Huang Zuntian sat at the head of the table. Dozens of steps below him stood existences emitting powerful auras, including Ancestor Xitian, Li Daokong, Shi Dudao, Jing Tiangong, and the others.
 The weakest was at the Freedom Realm!
 Huang Zuntian asked expressionlessly, “How’s the situation?”
 The others replied.
 “Yes, Laozi of the Three Pure Sacred World is one of the peak existences of the Chaos.”
 “It’s not only him. That Heavenly Sect Master is not easy to deal with, either.”
 “I’ve investigated. The prodigy nurtured by the Three Pure Sacred World has inherited the teachings of the Human, Jie, and Chan Schools. It’s said that Laozi even gave him a cultivation technique personally passed down by the Dao Ancestor.”
 “I suggest we attack before the Chaotic Assembly.”
 Huang Zuntian pondered after hearing his subordinates’ discussion. His right index finger tapped the armrest rhythmically. Ancestor Xitian took a step forward and said, “You have to deal with Laozi first if you want to deal with the Three Pure Sacred World. Life Lord, think twice.”
 Huang Zuntian leaned forward and smiled. “The Three Pure Sacred World has to be controlled. As for how to deal with Laozi, I have a way. If Laozi is not in the Three Pure Sacred World, can you be confident in flattening the Three Pure Sacred World and seizing its lineage?”


 Li Daokong added, “I can deal with the Heavenly Sect Master!”
 Ancestor Xitian did not have much experience and ability to develop. He had only guarded the Heavenly Dao in the past and had never interfered with its management.
 Huang Zuntian stood up and smiled. “The Life faction has been lying low for a long time. It’s time to show our sharpness. The Heavenly Dao will definitely have no objections to destroying the Three Pure Sacred World. We’ll leave after destroying it and seizing its lineage. We can’t stay in the Three Pure Sacred World for long.”
 “We obey Master’s instructions!”
 All Life members immediately accepted the order.
 Time passed quickly. The spectators by the river felt that the water flowed very slowly, but the fish were very fast.
 Han Jue opened his eyes. Another five hundred thousand years passed.
 He first entered the simulation trial and challenged the Nine-Headed Divine Spirit.
 He easily killed the Nine-Headed Divine Spirit in less than five minutes.
 He continued to challenge.
 After dozens of times, he reduced the time needed to kill the Nine-Headed Divine Spirit to twenty breaths.
 Not enough!
 It still took time to insta-kill the Nine-Headed Divine Spirit.
 Han Jue looked at Han Ling. This girl was still focused on cultivating. Her cultivation level kept increasing, making him feel that her cultivation speed was even faster than Han Huang’s.
 Could it be his influence?
 After all, Han Huang did not follow him every day. After leaving the third Dao Field, Han Huang still had to fight with the Evil Heavenly Emperor. This would also delay his cultivation time.
 No matter what, it was a good thing that Han Ling cultivated quickly.
 Han Jue started to check his emails.
 He was shocked.
 They fought!
 (Your good friend Heavenly Lord of Primordial Beginning was attacked) x49
 (Your good friend Li Daokong was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure.)
 [Your good friend Ancestor Xitian was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure.)
 (Your good friend Laozi was attacked by your good friend Huang Zuntian.)
 (Your good friend Huang Zuntian was attacked by your good friend Laozi and was severely injured.]
 (Your good friend Laozi was cursed by a mysterious curse. His Dharmic powers are in chaos.]
 (Your good friend Jing Tiangong has cursed too much and caused too much karma. His soul has been damaged.)
 Life and the Three Pure Sacred World fought!
 There were many emails below. Clearly, many years had passed since this battle.
 Han Jue teleported to the main Dao Field and looked at the Three Pure Sacred World.
 The Heavenly Dao was closer to the Three Pure Sacred World. Han Jue could see it at a glance.
 The once magnificent Three Pure Sacred World no longer existed. The void was filled with ruins, corpses, broken islands, and so on. It was no longer lively.
 An extremely exaggerated spatial crack stood above the Three Pure Sacred World, as if it had been slashed out by a sword.
 Han Jue secretly deduced that the spatial crack was created by Li Daokong.
 The current Li Daokong was already a Great Dao Sage and was extremely strong.
 As for the battle between Huang Zuntian and Laozi, he could not deduce it. He guessed that the two of them were fighting in a special domain.
 Han Jue retracted his gaze and sighed.
 He did not expect Huang Zuntian to have already grown to this extent.
 Han Jue thought for a moment and came to the 33rd Heaven and landed in the Universal Hall.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du was studying an Eight Trigrams Painting. He immediately stood up and bowed when he saw Han Jue.
 Han Jue was not interested in the Eight Trigrams Painting. He asked after sitting down, “How’s the situation in the Three Pure Sacred World?”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du replied, “There’s nothing. The Three Pure Sect leaders have already left this domain. After the Life faction snatched their resources, they also left one after another. In short, the Heavenly Dao has also benefited. At least, there are no longer any obstacles and dangers in the Three Pure Sacred World. I think that the Life Lord also guessed this, that’s why he dared to attack the Three Pure Sacred World.”
 No force dared to attack the Heavenly Dao in the current Chaos!
 Not even Life!
 Therefore, Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du didn’t associate Huang Zuntian with Han Jue.
 Han Jue asked, “Did Laozi look for you?”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du shook his head. “I haven’t contacted Teacher for a long time.”
 Han Jue asked in his mind, “Is what Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said true?”
 (90 million years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [It’s true.)
 Han Jue was satisfied. He had to be wary of him, even if Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du’s favorability towards him was almost at its peak.
 Then, Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du began to talk about the next development plan of the Heavenly Dao. With the destruction of the Three Pure Sacred World, the Heavenly Dao would definitely devour its domain.
 Next, the Heavenly Dao would rapidly expand. In the domain under the Divine Robe Daoist, all the worlds had no choice but to befriend the Heavenly Dao.
 However, the Heavenly Dao still needed time if it wanted to truly dominate a region. The Chaotic Domain was extremely vast. The Heavenly Dao was like a drop in the ocean. At most, it was invincible in the region.
 Han Jue left several hours later.
 He began to ponder after returning to the third Dao Field.
 This was not good.
 It would not be worth it if the Heavenly Dao developed too quickly and provoked the Ninth Chaos.
 Han Jue had to think of a way to restrict the Heavenly Dao when it was about to develop to the domain level.
 Of course, it would be a different story if he could already easily control the Ninth Chaos at that time. If he could not, he could only restrict the Heavenly Dao.
 Han Jue was not afraid. If he couldn’t defeat the Ninth Chaos, he could hide in the Dao Field, but not the Heavenly Dao.
 Just as Han Jue was preparing to cultivate. [Detected bearer of Connate providence, check its origin.)
 Han Jue was stunned.
 It had been a long time since he had seen this line of words.
 He immediately chose to check.
 [Hong Jun: One Mystic Divine Origin, reincarnation of the Dao Ancestor, Innate Great Creation, Dao World Divine Spirit, Unparalleled Dao Fruit, Creation Providence]
 Reincarnation of the Dao Ancestor!
 Han Jue looked over and saw a handsome young Daoist flying at the edge of the universe of stars.
 At first glance, this Daoist was very ordinary. His Dharmic powers and his cultivation level were average. It was very difficult to believe that he was the reincarnation of the Dao Ancestor.
 Why was this fellow here?
 Han Jue first thought of a conspiracy.
 Ordinary Great Dao Sages might not be able to deduce the relationship between the universe of stars and Han Jue, but Great Dao Supreme experts could. After all, this universe originally didn’t exist. It was created by Han Jue using the method of transforming illusion into reality.
 Han Jue began to pay attention to Hong Jun.
 Hong Jun flew for a few days and found a star to stay. He attracted Liu Bei’s attention.
 Liu Bei found Hong Jun. After interacting with him, Hong Jun actually became Liu Bei’s disciple.
 Could this be the Dao Ancestor’s plan?
 Han Jue didn’t tell Liu Bei. He wanted to see what Hong Jun was up to.


 Hong Jun’s arrival didn’t affect Han Jue’s cultivation. Soon, he entered seclusion again.
 On the other side.
 Liu Bei was preaching to Hong Jun.
 Liu Bei was very satisfied with his attitude. He finally felt like a master.
 No wonder Master liked to take in disciples so much.
 Liu Bei looked at the handsome Hong Jun and sighed.
 “Unfortunately, I could still nurture him to participate in the Chaotic Assembly if he came ten million years earlier.”
 Liu Bei suddenly felt a little regretful.
 He already understood Hong Jun’s potential. He was definitely a prodigy.
 Liu Bei smiled just by thinking about it.
 Five hundred thousand years later.
 Han Jue was already 13 million years old. Not to mention the Heavenly Dao, the Chaos was already brand new.
 Han Jue glanced over. The void near the Heavenly Dao was filled with cities, floating islands, and other buildings. It was the same in other domains. The Chaos was considered peaceful under the Great Dao Divine Spirits’ supervision. The battle between the Life faction and the Three Pure Sacred World was nothing in the Chaos.
 Han Jue estimated that the number of Chaotic lifeforms had already increased by a hundred times.
 A Great Dao Sage would be born almost every ten thousand years. As for the Freedom Sages, there were naturally even more.
 As more and more geniuses appeared, the Chaos was also extremely lively. Even the Great Dao Door often gathered Great Dao Sages to exchange information.
 While Han Jue was observing the Chaos, on the other side, in the Consciousnessless Great Dao World.
 Dao Sovereign and the other three had an imposing aura. They formed four terrifying pillars of Qi that connected the world. The diameter kept increasing, as if the entire sky was splitting. The four of them were very far away from each other. The nearby spring water had already been sucked dry, leaving only pits of different sizes.
 Jiang Yi snorted. “Then can you defeat me?”
 “Defeat you?”
 “Come on! I’m not afraid!”
 The two of them stood up and prepared to fight.
 Dao Sovereign opened his eyes and said in a low voice, “What are you fighting for? Cultivate well. You will have plenty of opportunities to fight when the Chaotic Assembly begins!”
 The two of them had no choice but to sit down again.
 Dao Sovereign revealed a proud expression.
 Lao Dan carefully sized him up and discovered that he was indeed different. His eyes contained a powerful force that made one’s heart palpitate.
 “You want to participate in the Chaotic Assembly?”
 A voice sounded, and the Number One Deity appeared behind Lao Dan.
 Lao Dan was secretly shocked.
 So fast!
 He did not sense it at all.
 Dao Sovereign looked at him and asked, “Can’t we? This is our longtime plan.”
 Dao Sovereign frowned. “It’s not easy to lead the Chaotic Prodigies. It might not work even if you obtain the title of Eternal Peak. Besides, according to you, the Chaos and the Consciousnessless Great Dao World can’t fuse. They are opposing existences. How can the Chaotic Prodigies help the Consciousnessless Great Dao World?”
 “He won’t make a move as long as the Chaos is not destroyed. He’s extremely conceited. This is our opportunity, and also the opportunity of the Consciousnessless Great Dao World and the Heavenly Dao.”
 Zhao Xuanyuan and Jiang Yi looked at each other and did not say anything. They left it to Dao Sovereign to deal with.
 Dao Sovereign said in a low voice, “We will consider it.”
 The Number One Deity said, “You mentioned the Divine Authority Generals just now. The Consciousnessless Great Dao World also has a similar Great Dao Providence Divine Authority, and it’s the strongest Great Dao Providence Divine Authority. I’ve already learned it before you came. Do you want to see it?”
 With that said, Dao Sovereign and the other three became interested. Zhao Xuanyuan urged him to show it quickly.
 The Number One Deity flew into the sky and slowly raised his arms.
 Boom!
 The ground shook violently as terrifying auras emerged from the ground like countless volcanoes erupting. Dao Sovereign and the other three were shocked.
 With a loud sound, a black figure broke through the ground and flew into the sky.
 The four of them looked over. It was a black figure. His figure seemed to be covered in armor. He was burly and domineering, emitting a terrifying aura.
 The moment he stopped, the surrounding space began to distort, forming a terrifying and strange scene.
 Dao Sovereign and the other three frowned.
 Zhao Xuanyuan muttered, “What a powerful aura. It definitely surpasses the Great Dao Sage Realm. It’s even stronger than the Divine Authority Generals back then.”
 Jiang Yi frowned. “The Divine Authority Generals are powerful in terms of numbers. Twenty thousand.”
 With that, figures broke out from the ground and rushed into the sky like black arrows.
 The Number One Deity looked down at the vast scene gathered below and said, “The Chaos already has Divine Authority Generals. Thus, I’ll give them the position of Destruction Authority Generals.
 “There are as many as twenty thousand Chaotic Divine Authorities, while I have as many as a hundred thousand Destruction Authority Generals.


 A hundred thousand Destruction Authority Generals!
 Dao Sovereign and the other three were moved. Just one made them shiver. How strong were a hundred thousand Destruction Authority Generals?
 They were filled with fear.
 At first, they worked with the Number One Deity because he was stupid. However, as time passed, they could no longer see through him. Now, they discovered that their strength was far inferior to the Number One Deity. This was not good!
 The power of the Destruction Authority Generals that filled the sky formed a darkness that covered the sky and the earth, oppressive and terrifying
 The Number One Deity looked at Dao Sovereign. “I have such power. If you can rope in the geniuses of the Chaos, you will definitely be able to overturn the Chaos in the future. I promise that after overturning the Chaos, the Consciousnessless Great Dao World and the Heavenly Dao will definitely not be enemies. You’re still the Realm Lords of the Consciousnessless Great Dao World. I want the Consciousnessless Great Dao World to obtain freedom and cultivate in peace.
 “I don’t care about power, but the Chaos suppressed the Consciousnessless Great Dao World, causing my cultivation to be severely obstructed. I’m the first living being in the Consciousnessless Great Dao World. My fate is closely related to it.”
 The Number One Deity’s tone was very calm, but in his opinion, he was already extremely sincere.
 Zhao Xuanyuan spread his hands and smiled. “You’re right. We think so, too. Call back these Destruction Authority Generals first.”
 He pretended to be calm but was sweating internally.
 The Number One Deity immediately waved his hand. All the Destruction Authority Generals burrowed underground again and disappeared, leaving only dust in the sky.
 The Number One Deity exchanged pleasantries with them before leaving.
 Dao Sovereign’s expression was solemn.
 He wondered if his Ultimate Defense had a chance of winning against a hundred thousand Destruction Authority Generals.
 Jiang Yi snorted. “I keep feeling that he has ill intentions.”
 Lao Dan smiled. “No matter what, we are his saviors. He has never hurt us and even gave us such a huge opportunity.”
 He did not think so, but he was afraid that the Number One Deity would hear him, so he deliberately said good things. Dao Sovereign sat down and said, “Continue cultivating. We both control the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority. We can’t be left behind!”
 Zhao Xuanyuan’s expression turned ugly when he thought of the hundred thousand Destruction Authority Generals.
 He shivered just thinking about being surrounded by a hundred thousand Destruction Authority Generals
 At this moment, he suddenly thought of his master, Han Jue.
 What was Han Jue’s mentality when he faced twenty thousand Divine Authority Generals?
 Sigh.
 He wondered how strong his master was now.
 Zhao Xuanyuan fell into a daze.
 Han Jue started to check his emails after observing the Chaos.
 He discovered that Dao Sovereign and the other three appeared the most. They were all about opportunities. It seemed that they were really about to soar.
 ere
 Apart from Dao Sovereign and the other three, Han Tuo, Han Huang, Jiang Jueshi, Han Yu, Qin Ling, and the other descendants and disciples also began to frequently obtain opportunities and increase their cultivation.
 Han Jue thought for a moment and teleported to the second Dao Field.
 Dao Comprehension Sword and Li Yao were very happy to see him and immediately surrounded him.
 However, Han Jue didn’t chat with them. He quickly gathered all the Fiendcelestials in front of the Daoist temple.
 “Regarding the Chaotic Assembly, does anyone want to participate?” Han Jue asked. Since it was a banquet he organized, he would naturally make it bigger.
 Guan Bubai was the first to speak. “I want to participate!”
 The other Fiendcelestials agreed and looked excited.
 Han Jue smiled. “Those who want to go out, raise your hands. I’ll send you out now.”
 With that said, most of the Chaotic Fiendcelestials raised their hands. They couldn’t hold it in anymore.
 Han Jue sent them out, leaving only the Black Hell Chicken, the Chaotic Heavenly Dog, the crimson fox, and the Dao Field guard, Dong Zhuo.
 Li Yao and Dao Comprehension Sword did not want to go out, either.
 Han Jue looked at the Black Hell Chicken and asked, “Aren’t you going out? You’re the only one who has never left the Dao Field. Now that I’ve already gone out, aren’t you going?”
 The current Black Hell Chicken was like a black phoenix. It was extremely handsome and stood as tall as an adult.
 “What’s the point of going out? My cultivation level can still increase. There’s no need to go out!” the Black Hell Chicken said proudly. The Chaotic Heavenly Dog followed suit.
 Han Jue smiled. “Should I send you back to the Hundred Peak Immortal River and find you a Black Hell Phoenix to marry?”
 “No, no!”
 The Black Hell Chicken hurriedly shook its head.
 The Chaotic Heavenly Dog said, “Master, it had such thoughts before, but it was dumped, so it made up its mind not to find a Dao Companion anymore.”
 Han Jue raised his eyebrows. Such a story had happened in the Hundred Peak Immortal River?
 The Black Hell Chicken said angrily, “What are you shouting for? Who gave you the right to speak?”
 The Chaotic Heavenly Dog could only shut up.
 “I don’t want to go out, either. I’ve just attained the Great Dao and want to continue cultivating to attain the Great Dao Supreme Realm. I don’t want to waste time outside.”
 There were already ten Great Dao Sages in the second Dao Field. Because they were all Chaotic Fiendcelestials, the earlier they became Chaotic Fiendcelestials, the higher their cultivation level.
 The Black Hell Chicken, the Chaotic Heavenly Dog, and the crimson fox immediately thanked him.
 Chaos ensued outside after Han Jue returned to the Daoist temple. The Black Hell Chicken was furious and was settling scores with the Chaotic Heavenly Dog. Han Jue didn’t leave immediately. Instead, he chatted with Li Yao and Dao Comprehension Sword.
 He had already given them status, so it was not easy for them to meet. He had to nurture their feelings.
 As they chatted, he realized that something was wrong with the two women.
 They were distracted during the conversation, but they looked at him with an extremely passionate gaze.
 With Han Jue’s cultivation, he could naturally tell what they were thinking.
 “Forget it. I see that you don’t want to chat. Who wants to go outside first?” Han Jue shook his head and laughed.
 Dao Comprehension Sword giggled. “Can I stay?”
 Li Yao blushed.
 Han Jue was stunned. He had never experienced this before. Should he try?
 He was tempted.
 It was fifty years later when he returned to the third Dao Field.
 Han Jue sat on the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus in a good mood.
 Han Ling opened his eyes and frowned. “Father, why do you have two different feminine auras?”
 Han Jue said, “Your Fourth Mother and Fifth Mother.”
 Han Ling was enlightened and did not ask further.
 Han Jue didn’t cultivate immediately but looked at Hong Jun outside the Dao Field.
 Hong Jun’s potential was outstanding. He had already attained the Dao after five hundred thousand years.
 The current Hong Jun had already established a lineage in the universe of stars and accepted many disciples. He was conferred the title of Sage by all living beings. As for Liu Bei, he hid behind the scenes and no longer did everything himself.


 Han Jue checked the Dao Ancestor’s profile picture.
 The Dao Ancestor did not transform into Hong Jun. It was still pitch black, and his true appearance could not be seen.
 It seemed that although this Hong Jun was the Dao Ancestor’s reincarnation, he was not the Dao Ancestor. The Dao Ancestor was ever-changing and had countless Dharma Idols. There might be many reincarnations like this.
 Han Jue asked in his mind, “I want to know why the Dao Ancestor reincarnated as Hong Jun?”
 (There is no such karma. It cannot be deduced.]
 Eh?
 He couldn’t derive it?
 Han Jue’s fear of the Dao Ancestor increased again.
 He could even deduce the Ninth Chaos, but he couldn’t deduce the Dao Ancestor.
 Could it be that the Dao Ancestor was stronger than the Ninth Chaos?
 No, if that was really the case, why would the Dao Ancestor stop the Heavenly Dao from developing?
 There was only one possibility. The Dao Ancestor contained a special creation or Supreme Treasure.
 Han Jue suddenly looked forward to the scene of the Dao Ancestor appearing.
 At that time, the Dao Ancestor would definitely already have the strength to challenge the Dao Creator.
 Han Jue looked at Hong Jun again. “I’ll pretend not to know your background if you can lead all the living beings in the universe to cultivate. But I’ll make you regret it if you scheme against me.”
 Han Jue thought silently.
 He had no grudge against the Dao Ancestor, so he naturally would not deal with him.
 After living for more than ten million years, Han Jue’s principle was not to provoke him, but they were both fine. If they threatened him, sorry, he had to die even if he had a huge backing and terrifying strength.
 Han Jue closed his eyes and continued cultivating
 The Ultimate Origin Qi in the Ultimate Origin World increased after a hundred thousand years. Gradually, a Chaotic Fiendcelestial in the Ultimate Origin World also encountered the Ultimate Origin Qi.
 This Fiendcelestial was the Space Fiendcelestial.
 In the void.
 The Space Fiendcelestial looked at the vast red mist ahead with a curious expression.
 This Fiendcelestial had a human body. Its hair was white and was longer than its body. Its armor was formed by bones. Its four eyes were vertical and it had a mouth full of sharp teeth. There were two horns on its forehead that curved forward.
 The Space Fiendcelestial hesitated for a while before suddenly making up its mind and rushing into the red mist.
 The nearby space began to distort violently when its figure was drowned by the red mist.
 Tens of thousands of years later.
 The red mist surged violently as a terrifying figure slowly stepped out.
 It was the Space Fiendcelestial!
 The Space Fiendcelestial raised its hands and muttered, “What a powerful force… What Spirit Qi is this? It’s actually stronger than the nebulous Primordial Qi.”
 “It’s Ultimate Origin Qi, an existence higher than Primordial Qi.”
 An indifferent voice suddenly sounded in the Space Fiendcelestial’s mind, startling it so much that it looked around. Its Sage Sense swept out, but it detected no auras of other living beings or Fiendcelestials in the nearby galaxies.
 The Space Fiendcelestial frowned and asked in a low voice, “Who? Come out!”
 “I am the existence who created you and everything you see.”
 Han Jue’s voice resounded in the Space Fiendcelestial’s mind again.
 The Space Fiendcelestial was moved.
 It trembled and looked around excitedly.
 Then, no matter how it asked, Han Jue’s voice never appeared again.
 However, this matter stirred the Space Fiendcelestial’s lonely heart.
 So there was really a creator. It was not without a background, and that supreme existence had always been staring at it.
 The Space Fiendcelestial was excited. It looked at the surrounding Ultimate Origin Qi with anticipation.
 The five hundred thousand years of seclusion ended again.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and felt the surging Ultimate Origin Power. His red eyes flashed.
 This was a good sign!
 In addition, the Space Fiendcelestial’s transformation after absorbing the Ultimate Origin Qi made Han Jue see a possibility.
 The three thousand Fiendcelestials could also evolve!
 Once the three thousand Fiendcelestials in the Ultimate Origin World evolved, they would no longer be Chaotic Fiendcelestials. They would not have a karmic conflict with the Chaotic Fiendcelestials if they entered the Chaos.
 Han Jue was only thinking. There was a high chance that he wouldn’t expose the Ultimate Origin World
 However, this matter was enough to show one thing. The Ultimate Origin World’s evolution was not only in Spirit Qi but also in all aspects, including the living beings in the world.
 Han Jue looked forward to the Ultimate Origin World’s growth even more.
 He looked at Han Ling beside him. His daughter’s cultivation level had been increasing. Although she was still far from the Great Dao Supreme Realm, this speed made her immersed in cultivation.
 Han Jue couldn’t help but smile.
 He began to check his emails. Time passed quickly, but to the living beings of the Chaos, five hundred thousand years felt like a long time.
 The Fiendcelestials of the second Dao Field had been extremely active in this time. They kept obtaining opportunities and were constantly attacked.
 Murong Qi and the Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial’s cultivation levels broke through a minor realm and progressed extremely quickly.
 Apart from the Fiendcelestials of the second Dao Field, there was another person who attracted Han Jue’s attention.
 Chu Shiren!
 [Your grand-disciple Chu Shiren has obtained the faith of ten billion Buddhist disciples and stepped into the Great Dao.]
 (Your grand-disciple Chu Shiren created a Great Dao Mystical Power. His providence has increased greatly.]
 [Your grand-disciple Chu Shiren has entered the Chaotic Crack.]
 [Your grand-disciple Chu Shiren accidentally obtained an ancient inheritance and his soul transformed.]
 (Your grand-disciple Chu Shiren was attacked by Heavenly Devils] X203972082
 These were Chu Shiren’s actions in the past five hundred thousand years. Just from the words in the emails, it could be seen that he had been living an exciting life.
 Chu Shiren had established a new Buddha and had been in seclusion ever since he moved to the Buddhist World near the Heavenly Dao. Now, the Buddhist World was already controlled by his grand-disciple, and he was an ancient legend. All living beings had only heard of his legend and had never seen his main body.
 It seemed that Chu Shiren was going to participate in the Chaotic Assembly and had been stimulated. That was why he was frantically seeking opportunities.
 Han Jue suddenly sighed.
 There were still more than a million years until the Chaotic Assembly.
 Han Jue looked forward to it even more.
 He closed his eyes and continued cultivating.
 A hundred thousand years!
 Three hundred thousand years!
 Five hundred thousand years!
 A million years passed in his seclusion.
 There were still six to seven hundred thousand years until the Chaotic Assembly!
 Han Jue opened his eyes. A million years of cultivation had already multiplied his strength. The Ultimate Origin Qi in the Ultimate Origin World already occupied a tenth of the area.
