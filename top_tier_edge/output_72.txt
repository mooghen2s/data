 Han Jue stared at the Supreme Rules after cursing the Carefree Immortal to death. The mighty figures left when they recovered and stopped rampaging.
 Han Jue asked in his mind, “Can the Carefree Immortal still be revived?”
 (This karma doesn’t exist.)
 He was beyond dead!
 Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief.
 Another enemy was gone. How wonderful.
 Next, he could cultivate and wait for the Chaotic Will.
 Han Jue wiped the Book of Misfortune. Although there was no dust, it still felt ritualistic.
 “You will always be my most important treasure,” Han Jue muttered to himself. In the cultivation world, treasures referred to Dharma treasures.
  Along the way, the Book of Misfortune had contributed the most.
 How many enemies had he killed, causing them to die before they could take revenge? It had bought him a long period of cultivation.
 He put away the Book of Misfortune and continued cultivating.
 He had just cursed Carefree Immortal to death. He couldn’t go out and wander around.
 At least not for the next five hundred thousand years.
 Five hundred thousand years were countless eras for all living beings. However, it was as if he had taken a nap in the eyes of a Great Dao Supreme. The period of time was not long.
 Han Jue closed his eyes.
 Mist spread in the dark void.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor stopped before a mighty figure and bowed respectfully.
 He didn’t dare to look at this unknown existence, but his tone was not humble.
 This existence was the Formless Transcendent Deity, but the Evil Heavenly Emperor did not know his name.
 “Yes.”
 The Formless Transcendent Deity only said a word, but it brought endless pressure to the Evil Heavenly Emperor.
 “What should I do?”
 “Continue what you are doing. The future is still the same.”
 “I don’t need to prepare?”
 “You’re too weak. You’re not qualified to enter the next game. You’re not even a pawn.”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor was silent.
 Although the Heavenly Court was developing very well, his potential was not good. He had yet to attain the Great Dao.
 The Formless Transcendent Deity said, “Two people from the Heavenly Court can enter the game.”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor’s eyes flickered as he guessed their identities.
 “I understand. Thank you for your guidance, Senior.”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor bowed and left.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor came to Han Huang’s palace after returning to the Heavenly Court. Four Heavenly Soldiers were guarding the door. They immediately knelt down and bowed when they saw him.
 “Divine General Han is still not out of seclusion?” the Evil Heavenly Emperor placed his hands behind his waist and asked softly.
 They had never seen Han Huang because the Heavenly Soldiers guarding this hall had already changed by more than a thousand times. To the Heavenly Soldiers, Han Huang was an ancient legend. They were also looking forward to seeing the legendary invincible Divine General.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor did not say anything else. He turned around and prepared to leave.
 At this moment, the palace door suddenly opened. A terrifying aura rushed out, instantly pressing the four Heavenly Soldiers to the ground
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor’s dragon robe fluttered as he turned around. His expression was calm, but his heart was in turmoil.
 This aura…
 Good kid!
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor immediately entered the hall and the door closed. The four Heavenly Soldiers stood up and looked at each other, not daring to say a word.
 He was stunned.
  He thought he saw Han Jue.
 Unknowingly, Han Huang already had Han Jue’s aura.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor stopped in front of Han Huang and sized him up. He smiled and asked, “You broke through?”.
 Han Huang opened his eyes and said, “No, it’s too difficult to break through to the Great Dao Supreme Realm. However, I’ve learned a great Mystical Power. I’m not afraid even if it’s a Great Dao Supreme.”
 “So arrogant?”
 “Hehe, I’m talking about the weakest among the Great Dao Supremes.”
 “That’s still very impressive.”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor smiled. Han Huang also smiled.
 Han Huang changed.
 Han Huang looked up and said, “Your Majesty, I’ve been immersed in the River of Destiny and seen many things during this period of time. I’ve personally witnessed your past with my father. Actually, I really want to ask you a question. Why did you decide to rope my father in? You did everything you could to help him.”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor sat down and smiled. “If it’s only talent, I will admire it, but I won’t do my best. Back then, for the sake of the mortal world, he dared to face the entire Heavenly Court alone. Such righteousness and courage are worthy of my trust.
 “As long as you do something for such a person, he will never be ungrateful. “Although your father only knows how to enter seclusion and tell you descendants and disciples that he won’t care if anything happens to you, that’s just to scare you. He won’t let it go if something really happens to you. From the beginning till now, if anyone close to him died, he would think of all ways to help them revive.”
 Han Huang was silent. He recalled his father’s words before he left and then thought of the scene of his father fighting the Carefree Immortal. A certain emotion surged in his heart.
 It was hard to say.
 Han Huang nodded, his eyes shining. “I will catch up to Father and surpass him to achieve my goal.”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor asked, “Oh? What goal? Surpassing your father is not the greatest goal?”
 Han Huang smiled. “An unspeakable goal.”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor was stunned.
 Han Huang closed his eyes.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor stared at him in a daze.
 He suddenly felt it at this moment.
 He felt the difference.
 This difference was not as simple as potential, but the impact on the Evil Heavenly Emperor was unprecedented. Furthermore, only he could experience this impact.
 “So I’m really tiny…”
 This sentence echoed in the Evil Heavenly Emperor’s mind.
 A hundred thousand years later.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and smiled brightly.
 What a domineering Ultimate Origin Power!
 His Ultimate Origin Power had transformed again. Not only that, but the nebulous Primordial Qi in the center of the Primordial World had begun to transform.
 A higher energy gas that surpassed the nebulous Primordial Qi!
 Han Jue named it Ultimate Origin Qi!
 His strength would increase by trillions or even more when the entire Primordial World became the Ultimate Origin World. It was immeasurable.
 The entire Ultimate Origin World was equivalent to Han Jue’s soul. He wouldn’t die unless it was destroyed.
  Moreover, as long as he was still alive, he could still recover the Ultimate Origin even if it was destroyed. It sounded almost impossible to kill him.
 Han Jue also realized the difference between the Great Dao Supreme and Dao Creator realms.
 The so-called half-step Creator Realm of the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit was too far away!
 The Ancient Desolate he relied on was nothing at all. He wanted the Ancient Desolate to replace the Chaos. It was like a mortal trying to devour a Sage or an ant trying to eat the sky.
 Utter nonsense.
 Han Jue began to observe the Primordial World. He noticed something.
 The Primordial World had given birth to a Primordial Chaos Realm cultivator!
 This was too fast!
 Back then, hadn’t the Chaos been nurtured for countless years before producing a Primordial Chaos Realm being?


 Han Jue questioned himself. Should he put the 53 Chaotic Fiendcelestials into the Primordial World? They would help him unify it.
 But he realized there was no need upon a second thought.
 Forget it.
 All eggs couldn’t be placed in one basket.
 What if someone betrayed him? Besides, he could never reveal all his trump cards.
 Han Jue pondered.
 Even the people closest to him didn’t know, let alone enemies.
  Han Jue observed the Primordial World and then teleported to the main Dao Field.
 He hadn’t paid attention to the Heavenly Dao for many years. He should take a look.
 This was his territory. He had to take a look!
 More and more Heavenly Dao Sages emerged in the Heavenly Dao while he was in seclusion. There were already more than ten Freedom Sages in the territory. The Heavenly Dao Domain doubled in size and the Immortal World changed drastically.
 Han Jue was very glad. He was right to leave the Sages alive.
 The Heavenly Dao wouldn’t be so prosperous if he were the one governing it.
 He was only suitable to back it, not to manage all living beings.
 More and more Heavenly Dao cultivators went to the Chaos and spread the Heavenly Dao’s providence and karma on the vast map of the Chaos.
 Some old people left and some new people rose in the Heavenly Dao. There were many people, and it was currently the healthiest development.
 The Heavenly Dao did not carry out an absolute peaceful policy, so providence sects and dynasties often attacked each other. However, such a situation made the Heavenly Dao stable. Yin and Yang were harmonious. It was feasible for immortals and gods to be righteous. The netherworld was reasonable and could be taken in. The hatred in the world was not suppressed. Although negative karma increased, there were no signs of calamity.
 Several hours later.
 Han Jue left and returned to the third Dao Field.
 He called Xing Hongxuan over.
 “Husband, do you miss me?” she asked with a smile.
 Han Jue smiled and said, “That’s right.”
 Overjoyed, Xing Hongxuan pounced into his arms.
 Just as she was about to take the next step, Han Jue said, “I’m preparing to expand the Han family. What do you think?”
 Stunned, Xing Hongxuan asked in surprise, “Do you want children or descendants?”
 Han Jue smiled. “Anything is fine. I plan to have a son every ten million years.”
 Xing Hongxuan said in a low voice, “Then it’s Xuan Qingjun’s turn. She’s been waiting for a long time.”
 “You’re willing?”
 “Of course. It’s already my honor to serve you. How can I monopolize you?”
 Xing Hongxuan shook her head. She knew very well that liking someone was not about dominance.
 Han Jue smiled. “You have to persuade Huang’er and Qing’er to start a family when they return.”
 Xing Hongxuan nodded. “Huang’er is still fine. After all, he’s a man. Qing’er is a woman. How can she take the initiative? She’s your only daughter. You have to be careful about her marriage. You can’t take her marriage lightly.”
 Han Jue fell into deep thought.
 That was true.
 How could the Divine Might Heavenly Sage’s precious daughter marry just anyone?
 How many people could catch his eye in the entire Chaos?
 Choose from the disciples?
 Forget it, he still had to ask his daughter about her thoughts. If she did not have such intentions, it would be fine if she did not marry. After all, the direct bloodline had to be inherited by a son.
 Several days later.
 Xing Hongxuan left in satisfaction.
 Han Jue continued cultivating.
 Since he didn’t know when the Chaotic Will would appear, all he could do was continue cultivating
 In the crimson sky, the sea of clouds overlapped and the endless sea surged.
 The Holy Mother of Order stood at the end of the sea, majestic like a mountain. The sun behind her emitted a blinding light.
 A figure suddenly appeared in front of the Holy Mother of Order. It was Laozi.
 Laozi frowned and asked, “Do you feel it?”
 The Holy Mother of Order replied, “Let nature take its course.”
 “What power is that?”
 “Supreme Rules.”
 “Then why would it affect us Great Dao Supremes? I’m already like this. As for the myriad living beings…”
 Laozi narrowed his eyes and asked, “Was my master controlled by this power back then?”
 The Holy Mother of Order said, “Everyone other than him.”
 Laozi was moved.
 The Holy Mother of Order sighed. “Fellow Daoist Li has already reached the peak of the Great Dao and can be considered to have transcended the rules. You should understand the difference between doing it along the way and going against the Dao. Go back and cultivate well. Wait for your Dao heart’s guidance.”
 The Holy Mother of Order did not answer.
 Laozi asked, “Who are we talking about this time? The Divine Might Heavenly Sage? The Ultimate God of Punishment? Or that Dark Forbidden Lord and Life Lord?”
 The Holy Mother of Order still did not answer.
 Laozi understood something and bowed before disappearing.
 The Holy Mother of Order did not move. She was like a statue standing on the sea, ancient and weathered.
 There was no day or night in the Order World. The sky would occasionally change color, but it was still daytime.
 After a certain period of time.
 The Holy Mother of Order slowly raised her right hand, causing a tornado to rise from the sea and soar into the sky.
 The Holy Mother of Order did not move no matter how the violent waves struck her body.
 Above the Chaos.
 The high and mighty Seven Supreme Rules began to slowly fuse. Their movements were very slow and there was no movement.
 Apart from a few mighty figures, no one in the entire Chaos noticed this.
 On a barren star.
 Huang Zuntian was meditating in a huge pit. Countless tiny black stones floated around him.
 Suddenly, he opened his eyes and strange black patterns appeared between his eyebrows.
 He frowned and muttered, “What’s going on? The power of the Divine Authority…”
 Black light suddenly burst out from his eyes. His entire body began to shake violently as if he was about to explode.
 After a while.
 Huang Zuntian regained his calm. He raised his head again and his expression became indifferent. He looked into the depths of the universe and muttered to himself, “Divine Might Heavenly Sage, you’ve harmed me this deeply!”
  He suddenly stood up and disappeared with the countless tiny black stones around him.
 At the same time.
 Heavenly Dao, outside the 33rd Heaven, in a palace.
 The door suddenly opened!
 A terrifying aura erupted!
 A figure slowly walked out. It was Azure Heaven Mystic.
 Azure Heaven Mystic’s face was filled with anger and killing intent. He looked down at the Immortal World and shouted in a low voice, “Divine Might Heavenly Sage, you severed my karma. I will definitely eliminate
 you!”
 This would definitely have disturbed the other Sages in the past, but no Sage appeared this time.
 The 33rd Heaven fell into a strange silence.


 Han Jue was still in seclusion when he was suddenly interrupted by a notification.
 [Your good friend Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du has developed hatred towards you. Current Hatred Points: 6 stars]
 [Your son Han Tuo has developed hatred towards you. Current Hatred Points: 6 stars]
 (Your son Han Huang has developed hatred towards you. Current Hatred Points: 6 stars]
 [Your disciple Zhou Fan has developed hatred towards you. Current Hatred Points: 6 stars]
 [Your good friend Evil Heavenly Emperor has developed hatred towards you. Current Hatred Points: 6 stars]
 (Your disciple Ji Xianshen has developed hatred towards you. Current Hatred Points: 6 stars]
 [Your disciple Jiang Jueshi has developed hatred towards you. Current Hatred Points: 6 stars]
 (Your good friend Huang Zuntian has developed hatred towards you. Current Hatred Points: 6 stars]
  Hatred notifications appeared one after another. It was not only his good friends but also many names he had never heard of.
 Han Jue frowned. The Chaotic Will had begun?
 He checked his attributes panel. He was only 10,372,308 years old. He was still more than 400,000 years away from refreshing the Mystical Destiny Book.
 This crisis came too early and caught him off guard.
 Han Jue noticed something.
 Any existence that had entered the Primordial Heavenly Prison did not turn to hatred.
 It seemed that the Primordial Heavenly Prison was still impressive. It was immune from the Chaotic Will’s influence.
 Han Jue sighed and went to seal Xing Hongxuan and Qingluan’er.
 Then, he sent a dream to the people enslaved by the Primordial Heavenly Prison and told them about the Chaotic Will and asked them to hide it well. He left this matter to them.
 The people enslaved by the Primordial Heavenly Prison were the Three Pure Sacred Ancestor, Heavenly Venerate Wufa, Qiu Xilai, Sect Master Tian Jue, Heavenly Calamity Emperor, Fang Liang, Pan Xin, Xu Dudao, Great Sage Void Soul, Divine Robe Daoist, Red Fate, Yang Che, Ultimate God of Punishment, and Ancestor Tian Xu.
 Ancestor Tian Xu stayed in the third Dao Field and was not assigned a mission by Han Jue for the time being.
 The last person Han Jue visited was the Ultimate God of Punishment. He asked something of him.
 In the dream.
 The Ultimate God of Punishment frowned. “The will of the Chaos is indeed terrifying. Other than those living beings who have never heard of you, everyone in the entire Chaos hates you. Furthermore, they are absolute mortal enemies. If you want to resolve it, you have to defeat half of the providence in the Chaos. The stronger your cultivation, the more providence you have. In other words, you have to defeat all the famous experts in the Chaos to resolve this situation.”
 Han Jue was enlightened. No wonder no matter how the Heavenly Dao’s descendants thought of Pangu and the Dao Ancestor, they still worshiped them. It meant that the two of them had successfully broken through.
 “No, then why did Pangu and the Dao Ancestor fail?” Han Jue frowned and asked.
 The Ultimate God of Punishment said, “This is only the death of all living beings. They should have encountered something after that, so Pangu perished and created the world. The Dao Ancestor hid in the Heavenly Dao, isolated from the Chaos. If the Heavenly Dao had continued to develop normally, it would have long been the center of the Chaos, the strongest place.”
 Han Jue said, “You don’t have to care about me. Just continue managing the Chaos.” “Are you confident?”
 “Yes.”
 The dream ended.
 Han Jue opened his eyes. He teleported to the main Dao Field and discovered that his Daoist temple was already surrounded.
 More than a hundred million disciples called the Hundred Peak Immortal River home. All the disciples wanted to barge into his Daoist temple, but the power of the system’s Dao Field made them helpless.
 It was not only in the Hundred Peak Immortal River but also outside.
 More and more cultivators rushed over.
 The will of the Chaos was indeed terrifying. Without a summoner, all living beings came spontaneously. Most importantly, these living beings didn’t sense this. In their memories, there was hatred towards the Divine Might Heavenly Sage that couldn’t be resolved.
 They had only heard that all living beings in the world wanted to suppress the Divine Might Heavenly Sage, so they came.
 As for who was the initiator, there were various opinions.
 Han Jue looked outside the 33rd Heaven. The Sages gathered in the Universal Hall and were discussing how to attack the Hundred Peak Immortal River and deal with the Divine Might Heavenly Sage.
  He found it funny, as if a group of children was plotting how to resist the adults, who were eavesdropping outside the window. At this moment, Han Jue felt powerful auras spying on the Heavenly Dao.
 Great Dao Supreme!
 There was no lack of perfected Great Dao Supreme existences among them!
 It had to be said that the foundation of the Chaos was still very strong.
 Han Jue asked in his mind, “What will happen if I defeat all the experts in the Chaos?”
 (1 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 (Face the Chaotic Will]
 “Will I die facing the Chaotic Will?” [1 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [40% chance of death]
 Han Jue showed a frown.
 So dangerous?
 He returned to the third Dao Field and thought, “I want to see myself facing the Chaotic Will!”
 (1 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Why was his lifespan still being deducted?
 Wasn’t this question essentially the same as the previous one?
 Han Jue cursed silently and chose to continue.
 His consciousness entered the illusion.
 When he opened his eyes again, he came to the three thousand Great Dao.
 He saw himself looking up at the Seven Supreme Rules.
 The Supreme Rules emitted a dazzling light and twisted violently, turning into seven figures.
 even
 Two of the figures were Huang Zuntian and Azure Heaven Mystic. The others were Divine Authority Generals whose appearance could not be seen clearly.
 Great Dao Providence Divine Authority Avatar!
 Is this the battle I have to face?
 Han Jue carefully sensed their auras. They were not weaker than the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit and the Carefree Immortal.
  A dignified voice sounded extremely cold. Han Jue had never heard this voice before.
 The future Han Jue in front replied, “I’ve been staying in seclusion all my life and rarely fought with others. The enemies I’ve killed are all people I have no choice but to kill. I’ve never killed innocent people, much less have the authority to control the Chaos. What crime is there?”
 The dignified voice continued, “The people you kill are all people who shouldn’t die. Some of them will perform Great Creation, some will push for calamity, and some will build merit. In order to protect the people around you, you caused the deaths of countless living beings. Your sins are immeasurable.”
 Han Jue laughed. “What a joke. A slight move will affect the entire situation? If you want to punish someone, you can always do it forcefully. Come, let me surpass the power of the Chaotic Will. I’ll make you shut up today!”
 The Seven Supreme Avatars swooped down at him. The three thousand Great Dao below rose and wove into a huge net of the Great Dao, wanting to restrain him.
 Han Jue watched nervously.
 Five minutes later.
 The future Han Jue killed the Seven Supreme Avatars. He was extremely powerful.
 Han Jue had to admit that from a spectator’s point of view, he was really handsome.
 However, it was not over!


 Han Jue was tiny in front of this majestic giant shadow. Even he, who had already reached the perfected Great Dao Supreme Realm, was a little shocked.
 This was even more exaggerated than cells looking up to a mountain!
 This size had already surpassed his realm!
 Although Han Jue could expand infinitely, it was impossible for him to reach the level of Chaos.
 But the majestic figure in front of him did it!
 The pressure that was visible to the naked eye was suffocating. Its aura far exceeded that of the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit!
 A name appeared in his mind.
 Dao Creator!
  No way!
 He was going to face a Dao Creator?
 Han Jue’s heart sank.
 SO
 The future Han Jue seemed to be shocked and didn’t say anything for a long time. The majestic figure was too tall and couldn’t be seen. The dignified voice from before sounded, “Han Jue, it’s still not too late to bow your head now. From now on, as long as you stay in your domain or the Heavenly Dao and don’t interfere with the Chaos or help the Heavenly Dao grow, this calamity will be over.”
 The future Han Jue was still silent.
 The illusion shattered.
 Han Jue opened his eyes with a solemn expression.
 What happened after that was either he admitted defeat or he was insta-killed. Otherwise, it would not have ended like this.
 He felt that it was most likely the former.
 He admitted defeat and hid in the Dao Field to continue cultivating.
 No matter how strong the Dao Creator was, it was impossible for him to barge into the Dao Field. That was why the other party was willing to give him a chance.
 Han Jue asked in his mind, “In the illusion just now, was the last giant shadow I faced a Dao Creator?”
 (500 trillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 This value was not the same as before.
 Forget it, let’s be safe.
 Continue!
 (No]
 Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief.
 The difference between 100 trillion years and 500 trillion years was so great?
 Han Jue showed a frown.
 What should he do?
 He had to think about facing the Chaotic Will before accepting the challenge of all living beings.
 Forget it, I’ll cultivate first!
 In any case, he was hiding in the Daoist temple and no one could find trouble with him. As for the disciples in the other Dao Field, they were restricted by the Dao Field and could not escape.
 No matter how strong hatred was, it would not change over time!
 It had to be said that the Chaotic Will was indeed domineering. The identity of the public enemy of all living beings came too quickly. It was simply like the restart button of the world.
 Han Jue couldn’t help but think of what Pangu said to him.
 Everything was a lie!
 To be able to control the world and one’s own will, what was the meaning of life?
 Those who didn’t reach the Dao Creator were ultimately weak!
 Ten years later.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and frowned.
 He had wanted to enter seclusion for hundreds of thousands of years, but the situation was not optimistic.
 He was fine, but the Heavenly Dao was suppressed by the various factions in the Chaos. No less than a hundred Great Dao Sages were near the Heavenly Dao.
 That’s right, more than a hundred Great Dao Sages!
 There were not even so many Great Dao Sages in the Chaos usually. All sorts of ghosts and monsters appeared after the Chaotic Will revived!
 Half of the Heavenly Dao’s Chaotic Heavenly Road was trampled on. The Heavenly Dao Hidden Sect was in chaos, as if it had been disbanded.
 Han Jue also deduced that Han Tuo, Han Huang, Zhou Fan, and the other descendants and disciples outside were attacked in all sorts of ways. Although they also hated Han Jue, the Chaotic lifeforms didn’t believe it and wanted to capture them to threaten him.
 Han Jue could use the Invocation Dao to summon them all back, but in that case, he couldn’t protect the Heavenly Dao and the Hidden Sect disciples.
 Not all Hidden Sect disciples knew the Invocation Technique.
 He had to divert his attention.
 Han Jue’s eyes flickered. He began to circulate his energy and mobilize the power of the three thousand Great Dao.
 He had already grasped the three thousand Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols. Although he did not directly control the three thousand Great Dao, he had the power of their rules.
 He used the power of the three thousand Great Dao and the power of the Ultimate Origin to create a clone. This clone contained his Ultimate Origin Power and all his Mystical Powers, but it did not have Dharma treasures or independent intelligence.
 He immediately sent his clone out.
 He split his will into two. One was responsible for the cultivation of the main body and the other was responsible for controlling the clone.
 His clone quickly traveled through the Chaos, far from the Heavenly Dao.
 “Where should I go?”
 Han Jue was a little conflicted.
 Han Jue immediately moved and quickly approached a Chaotic Domain.
 The past Grand Primordium Domain. This domain became barren after the Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial died. The Fiendcelestial’s murderous aura was still there and no cultivator dared to approach.
 His voice resounded throughout the Chaos. Even the living beings in the Heavenly Dao could hear it.
 Almost instantly, powerful auras locked onto the Grand Primordium Domain.
 It’s time!
 He deliberately threatened all living beings because he was afraid that seizing the Chaotic Qi’s providence would be too fast and could not buy time for his main body to cultivate.
 “Divine Might Heavenly Sage!”
 A cold snort sounded. Rolling green flames came from the depths of the Chaos. Above the flames, a man in a purple robe stepped forward.
 Great Dao Supreme!
 Furthermore, it was not an ordinary Great Dao Supreme!
 Han Jue stared at him calmly and didn’t say anything.
 The purple-robed man said, “I am…”
 Boom
 Han Jue suddenly appeared in front of the purple-robed man and stopped in front of him with a palm. The Divine Might Great Heaven Palm was invisible and colorless. It directly destroyed the purple-robed man’s body, leaving only his soul in the void.
 The endless green flames below instantly dissipated.
 The purple-robed man was moved. His soul trembled in disbelief.
 Impossible!
 He was a Great Dao Supreme!
 How could he not even have time to react?
 But the speed just now…
 Han Jue said expressionlessly, “Do you want to die?”
 The purple-robed man suppressed his fear and said angrily, “Divine Might Heavenly Sage, you destroyed my Dao Field and stole my Supreme Treasure…”
 Han Jue clenched his right hand into a fist and the purple-robed man’s soul was instantly destroyed.
  The other party was a Great Dao Supreme and definitely had a backup plan.
 If not, he deserved to die!
 The Chaotic Will was to blame!
 It took him ten million years of bitter cultivation to obtain today’s strength!
 Although all living beings were controlled by the Chaotic Will, they were enemies now!
 Enemies had to die!
 Han Jue could tolerate his family and disciples, he could tolerate the Heavenly Dao, but there was no reason to tolerate the Chaos!
 He spared the living beings in the Chaos only because he was afraid of the Dao Creator!
 However, he didn’t mind letting the first-rate cultivation realm of the Chaos decrease by a few levels!


 Powerful auras appeared in all directions of the Grand Primordium Domain as soon as he finished speaking.
 Han Jue also felt some familiar auras.
 Twelve Ancestral Magi! Heavenly Lord of Primordial Beginning!
 The Great Dao Sages in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End also came.
 After millions of years, all twelve Ancestral Magi had attained the Great Dao.
 Han Jue was expressionless. He wouldn’t show mercy.
 It was not only the Great Dao Sages. The Great Dao Supremes also came!
  Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols condensed above Han Jue’s head.
 In an instant, five hundred Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols condensed successfully. Five hundred was enough!
 The battle was about to begin!
 The five hundred Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols faced each other and roared in all directions, each using a Mystical Power.
 The Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial punched out. The wind from his fist was ferocious and tore through the void!
 The Shadow Flood Fiendcelestial raised its arms. Countless Shadow Fiendcelestials attacked like a torrent, unstoppable!
 The Combat Fiendcelestial condensed a battle intent divine weapon. The power of the divine weapon shook the Chaotic Qi and suppressed the aura of all enemies!
 …
 Inside the Daoist temple.
 Han Jue opened his eyes. Xing Hongxuan had just finished receiving a round of Absolute Purification.
 It took more than a hundred years, and his lifespan was also deducted. Absolute Purification could only be used one-on-one.
 It was really troublesome to use Absolute Purification to break through the Chaotic Will. He could at most use it on his family and personal disciples. Not to mention the Heavenly Dao, he couldn’t even save the Hidden Sect.
 This path did not work.
 Xing Hongxuan opened her eyes and saw him. She couldn’t help but ask curiously, “Husband, what happened? I think I had a dream that we became enemies…”
 She was extremely afraid upon recalling the dream.
 It was too real.
 Fortunately, it was all fake!
 Han Jue said, “That was not a dream.”
 He pointed at her forehead.
 The scenes of the Hundred Peak Immortal River surged into her mind, stunning her.
 “Chaotic Will…” Xing Hongxuan muttered to herself, her voice trembling.
 Although she had been cultivating beside Han Jue, she didn’t understand his vision. Her cultivation level made her unable to even understand the Chaos.
 She didn’t even dare to think about manipulating everyone’s thoughts.
 What kind of existence was the Chaotic Will that could control all living beings…
 In that case, what was the point of living beings?
 Xing Hongxuan was confused.
 She suddenly felt that everything was meaningless.
 She couldn’t be said to be weak. Everyone else was the same.
 What was the point of life when one discovered that one could be controlled by an existence?
 Han Jue said, “Don’t be afraid. I’m here.”
 His words were very light, but they carried a lot of weight. Xing Hongxuan looked at him and saw that he was calm. Her heart warmed and her previous sense of security returned.
 That’s right.
 With her husband around, what was she afraid of?
 Xing Hongxuan suddenly thought of something. “Isn’t Huang’er…”
 Xing Hongxuan nodded and did not dare to ask for anything. All she could do now was not to be a burden.
 Han Jue only used Absolute Purification to test this function. It took too long. He decided to cultivate hard.
 Since he might not be able to defeat the clone of the Chaotic Will, he might as well force it.
 He used his clones to constantly kill the powerful enemies and weaken the Chaos, forcing the Dao Creator to interfere.
 In any case, Han Jue’s main body was hiding in the Dao Field. The Dao Creator couldn’t hurt him!
 Let’s just do it!
 Han Jue’s eyes emitted a cold light.
 Xing Hongxuan saw the killing intent, but she did not say anything.
 In her heart, Han Jue was the most important. Even if all living beings were controlled to kill Han Jue and were killed by him, she would never pity them.
 She was very petty. There were not many people she could be concerned about. Her husband and son were enough.
 Grand Primordium Domain.
 Blood Qi surrounded the world. Corpses of different sizes were scattered in all directions of the Grand Primordium Domain.
 At first glance, this place was like a chaotic land. The ferocious negative karma was visible to the naked eye.
 Han Jue’s clone was sitting in the Grand Primordium Domain and waiting quietly.
 After a hundred years, all the mighty figures who came to challenge were killed by him!
 However, most mighty figures had life-saving methods. They either left behind clones, soul fragments, or Supreme Treasures to escape.
 On this day.
 Another mighty figure had arrived!
 Han Jue opened his eyes and saw a sword Qi crossing the void outside the Grand Primordium Domain, as if it was splitting the Chaos into two.
 Above the sword Qi was a figure dressed in a Daoist robe. He had white hair and sleeves that fluttered in the wind. His aura was like a sword that pierced through the Chaotic Void.
 Laozi!
 The two of them looked at each other from afar. The blood Qi and Chaotic Qi around the Grand Primordium Domain instantly stopped as if space and time had stopped.
 At this moment, countless cultivators stopped and watched from afar. They didn’t dare to approach, afraid that they would be affected.
 “Laozi is here!”
 “I hope he can resist the Divine Might Heavenly Sage.”
 “Sigh, it’s tough. The Divine Might Heavenly Sage is too strong. I feel that he’s already invincible.”
 “He defeated the Divine Authority Generals, killed the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit, and defeated a hundred Great Dao Sages. Since ancient times, the Divine Might Heavenly Sage is indeed number one. However, this person has done many evil things. He’s the calamity of the Chaos.”
 “What will happen to the Chaos if even Laozi is defeated?”
 “Laozi has a chance of winning as long as he can restrain the Divine Might Heavenly Sage. He’s not fighting alone, after all!”
 Han Jue stood up and stepped out of the Grand Primordium Domain.
 Laozi looked at him and said, “Actually, you have other paths to take. The path you chose is a path of no return. That Giant God was like this in the past. He died and his Dao dissipated. You can learn from my master.”
 Pangu slaughtered three thousand Chaotic Fiendcelestials and finally died.
 He couldn’t ask Han Jue to imitate the Dao Ancestor.
 Times were different from the past. If he lowered his head, the Heavenly Dao would not be as simple as stagnant. How many Sages would have to be sacrificed to return it to its previous state?
 In that case, the Heavenly Dao might as well be destroyed!
 Han Jue decided to risk it.
 Compared to the Chaotic Will, who was more ruthless?
 At most, he would make Ancestor Tian Xu use Life of All.
 Life of All was a Dao Destruction Mystical Power, a Destiny Mystical Power. It sacrificed one’s cultivation and providence in exchange for the death of all living beings. It could only be used under a certain Heavenly Dao or calamity. The price was that one’s cultivation level would decrease by a major realm!
 Ancestor Tian Xu wasn’t a Heavenly Dao lifeform. The entire Chaos would be affected when he used this move!
 This move was basically a life-and-death struggle with the Ninth Chaos!
