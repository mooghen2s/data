 “Cut the crap. Do you want to die?”
 The hot-tempered Zhurong roared, his roar resounding throughout the Dark Forbidden Zone.
 Di Jiang directly transformed into his Ancestral Magus True Body. He was like a Chaotic Fiendcelestial with a sinister and terrifying posture. One could sense the terrifying power contained in him just by looking at his muscles.
 The mysterious face smiled and said, “Your enemy is not me. Didn’t you go to the Heavenly Dao to revive Pangu?
 “Let’s not talk about whether you can find it. Even if you find it and revive Pangu, what should you do with the relationship between the living beings of the Heavenly Dao and Pangu? The Heavenly Dao will belong to Pangu? Can the Heavenly Dao’s Divine Might Heavenly Sage tolerate it? Can Pangu tolerate leaving the Heavenly Dao?”
 His words were filled with mockery, mocking the Ancestral Magi for being simple-minded.
 Di Jiang asked, “Have you seen our Father?”
  The mysterious face said, “Pangu has died for so long, so I’ve naturally never seen him. Aren’t you the same?”
 “Father’s power is invincible.”
 “Oh? You mean that if Pangu revives, the Divine Might Heavenly Sage will not be his match?”
 Di Jiang did not say anything else.
 It wouldn’t be good if these words spread to the Heavenly Dao.
 The mysterious face smiled sinisterly and said, “Di Jiang, oh Di Jiang, the era is different. Pangu is no longer an invincible existence. Not to mention those ancient existences who survived the Primordial Chaos, even the Dao Ancestor has already surpassed Pangu. To you, that will be a calamity. The most important thing for you now is to strengthen yourselves and not blindly pursue the power of your ancestors.”
 Di Jiang frowned. These words made his heart waver.
 Indeed.
 These Chaotic Fiendcelestials had cultivated for countless years longer than him!
 They were both Chaotic Fiendcelestials. Even if there was a difference in potential, it was not to the extent of great disparity.
 The mysterious face vanished, leaving behind a sentence.
 “Join Life at any time after you think it through. Life is an equal existence. It’s all for the sake of overthrowing the Chaos. If the Magus Race is willing to help me, you will obtain a status like the Heavenly Dao Human Race when the Dark Era descends. Everyone, you will be the new Great Dao Divine Spirits!”
 The Ancestral Magi looked at each other.
 So, it was Life!
 They naturally knew about Life. Previously, they had even fought with Life in the Heavenly Court.
 Great Sage Void Soul’s dark instincts made them all surrounded and beaten up by the thirteen Lives. They would probably be dead if not for Han Jue quickly ending it.
 In that case, Life was still their enemy!
 Gonggong said in a low voice, “Brother, don’t believe him. Who does he think he is? He insulted us and then threw us aside? Ridiculous!”
 The other Ancestral Magi nodded in indignation.
 Di Jiang snorted. “I naturally don’t believe him. Let’s continue on our way to the Heavenly Dao!”
 The huge palm continued forward at a faster speed than before.
 Netherworld, Yama Hall.
 Yang Tiandong supported his chin with one hand and yawned in boredom.
 A deafening boom came from outside the hall, shaking the Yama Hall, but Yang Tiandong did not panic at all.
 Soon, several ghost soldiers were kicked in and smashed into the wall behind Yang Tiandong. Immediately after, two figures with terrifying auras rushed in.
 “Hahaha, brother, this netherworld is nothing much. It can’t stop us brothers at all!”
 “Brother Zhizun, stop dawdling. Hurry up and capture the Life and Death Book!”
 It was Xia Zhizun and Qin Ling. Qin Ling’s cultivation level had begun to increase exponentially ever since he had obtained the 99 Emperor Essence Pills, attracting quite a bit of attention in the Divine Palace. Later, he met Xia Zhizun by chance. The two of them became friends after a fight. Although Qin Ling was not Xia Zhizun’s match, his stubbornness moved the latter. Then, the two of them became sworn brothers.
 This time, they had already broken through eighteen Yama Halls, but they still could not find the Life and Death Book. Therefore, they attacked Yang Tiandong’s palace.
 Yang Tiandong was the Great King of Hell in the netherworld. He was above the eighteen Kings of Hell. Only souls that contained great karma or extraordinary providence could enter his hall to be judged.
 Xia Zhizun stared at Yang Tiandong arrogantly and smiled. “Hey King of Hell, hurry up and hand over the Life and Death Book. The Heavenly Dao is peaceful and we don’t want to kill. The ghost soldiers along the way were only injured, but we don’t have that much patience.”
 Old man?
 Yang Tiandong laughed angrily. He casually threw the Life and Death Book in front of the two of them and said angrily, “What are you doing? Hurry up and get lost after you’re done!”
 Xia Zhizun and Qin Ling were stunned.
 This King of Hell was arrogant, but his actions were very honest.
 Xia Zhizun was about to scold back when Qin Ling stopped him and said, “Hurry up. There are many mighty figures hidden in the netherworld. It won’t end well if this matter blows up.”
 Hearing this, Xia Zhizun glared at Yang Tiandong. Then, he opened the Life and Death Book and started to quickly check.
 Yang Tiandong supported his chin with both hands and stared at him with a sigh.
 Time passed really quickly.
 Yang Tiandong chuckled. “Nothing. I’m thinking about when we’ll meet again.”
 “Not necessarily. Some things are destined.”
 “You mean I’ll die?”
 “I can’t say, I can’t say.”
 Qin Ling frowned. He felt inexplicably flustered by Yang Tiandong’s words.
 He quickly left with Qin Ling.
 Yang Tiandong’s smile froze.
 Why was this dog so hurtful?
 Yang Tiandong began to deduce Xia Zhizun’s identity and secretly noted it down.
 “Brat, just you wait. You will die in my hands sooner or later. Don’t even think about reincarnating and training in the future. I’ll let you be a pig or a dog, sinking into the cycle of reincarnation.”
 Yang Tiandong cursed in his heart. He was extremely depressed.
 Inside the Daoist temple.
 Han Jue opened his eyes. He had been in seclusion for another ten thousand years. He wanted to continue cultivating, but Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du informed him decades ago that the twelve Ancestral Magi had arrived.
 The cultivation of the twelve Ancestral Magi was too strong and they had revived in the Chaos. Other than Empress Houtu, no one could enter the Heavenly Dao. Empress Houtu could only walk outside the netherworld and the 33rd Heaven. She couldn’t enter the Immortal World or the myriad worlds.
 At this moment…
 The Magus Race and Sect Master Tian Jue were both meditating and cultivating in the hall. At first, they didn’t sense Han Jue’s aura. Until a Grand Magus who wasn’t cultivating caught a glimpse of him.
 “He’s here!” the Grand Magus said softly, startling the Ancestral Magi.
 Han Jue, who was covered in treasures, had an oppressive aura. Anyone would feel inferior in front of him.


 “How is that possible? I actually didn’t sense his arrival!”
 Di Jiang was shocked and vigilant.
 If Han Jue could approach him without anyone noticing, didn’t that mean that they would be insta-killed if he wanted to kill them?
 He would be severely injured even if he didn’t die!
 Di Jiang would never forget the scene of Han Jue fighting the Despair Dao Spirit.
 He was even more domineering than the Ancestral Magi!
 Sect Master Tian Jue stood up and cupped his hands. Then, he waved his sleeve and a mat appeared beside him.
  Han Jue sat down beside Sect Master Tian Jue and gestured for the Ancestral Magi to sit down.
 “Empress Houtu, long time no see.” Han Jue began to be polite to her.
 He started with the familiar people and broke the silence.
 Empress Houtu smiled. “Indeed, it’s been a long time. How many years has it been? Fellow Daoist Han is truly different from before. Your talent is probably one of the best among the Chaotic Fiendcelestials.”
 The other Ancestral Magi didn’t say anything, but they still forced a smile at Han Jue.
 It had to be said that although Han Jue’s appearance was not loud, it stunned the twelve Ancestral Magi.
 Han Jue chatted with Empress Houtu for a while before asking about the Magus Race’s intentions.
 Empress Houtu looked at Di Jiang.
 He said seriously, “We want to send a portion of the Grand Magi into the Heavenly Dao to search for Father’s will. We will leave once we find it. I know the rules, so we Ancestral Magi will wait here and not interfere with the Heavenly Dao.”
 They were once members of the Heavenly Dao. They should be returning home, but now, they felt like guests.
 Han Jue asked, “Pangu’s will? What is that? All his descendants?”
 Di Jiang shook his head. “We won’t touch Father’s descendants. As for his will, we’re not sure for the time being. We still have to search.”
 Han Jue remained silent.
 He asked in his mind, “Is what Di Jiang said true?”
 (200 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [It’s true.]
 “What is Pangu’s will?”
 (1 trillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 (Pangu’s Will: A trace of intelligence left behind by Pangu when he created the world. It is sealed in the Heavenly Dao. Only someone with the cultivation of the Great Dao Supreme Realm can barely see through it.]
 There was such a move?
 Could the Heavenly Dao Spirit be Pangu’s will?
 Thinking about it carefully, it made sense. For so many descendants of Pangu to appear in the Heavenly Dao, there must be a method left behind by Pangu.
 No matter what, the cultivation level of the Magus Race was too low. It was impossible for them to sense Pangu’s will.
 The Ancestral Magi’s hearts sank upon seeing that Han Jue didn’t say anything.
 They thought that he was going to refuse.
 Sect Master Tian Jue revealed an intriguing expression.
 He was already very unhappy with the Ancestral Magi’s attitude. Thus, he felt good upon seeing Han Jue suppress them.
 Weren’t you very arrogant earlier?
 Why don’t you dare to say anything now?
 The atmosphere became subtle.
 Han Jue looked up and saw that the Ancestral Magi were very nervous. He couldn’t help but smile and say, “Of course. I was just thinking about what Pangu’s will might be and wanted to reduce the trouble for you. However, I still don’t understand after thinking about it. But it won’t make sense if I directly reject you. You can arrange for the Grand Magi to go to the Immortal World.”
 The Ancestral Magi were pleasantly surprised and thanked him. For a time, news of favorability increasing appeared in front of him.
  Han Jue ignored the notifications and looked at Sect Master Tian Jue. “You should receive these fellow Daoists next.”
 Sect Master Tian Jue nodded.
 Han Jue immediately stood up and left.
 Empress Houtu looked at his back and hesitated.
 The Grand Magi looked at Han Jue in reverence. This was the first time they saw the twelve Ancestral Magi so nervous.
 After Han Jue left the Sacred Palace, he returned to the Hundred Peak Immortal River and continued cultivating.
 He believed that the Ancestral Magi would not act recklessly.
 If they dared, Han Jue would make them regret it.
 The current him was already qualified to be arrogant!
 However, he kept his arrogance in his heart and never expressed it in his words.
 Time passed.
 In the blink of an eye, another fifty thousand years passed.
 Han Jue opened his eyes. He looked over and discovered that the Magus Race had already left.
 Clearly, the Grand Magi did not find Pangu’s will.
 Han Jue didn’t care about the Ancestral Magi’s mood when they left. It was fine as long as it didn’t affect the Heavenly Dao.
 He started checking his emails.
 [Your disciple Dao Sovereign has entered the Three Pure Sacred World.)
 [Your disciple Zhao Xuanyuan…)
 (Your grand-disciple Chu Shiren was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure. His soul was imprisoned.)
 (Your son Han Tuo has fallen to the demonic path. His cultivation has increased greatly.]
 (Your disciple Zhou Fan was attacked by your good friend Li Daokong.)
 (Your good friend Evil Heavenly Emperor was attacked by your good friend Shi Dudao.] (Your good friend Ancestor Xitian was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure.]
 (Your good friend Di Jiang was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure.]
 So many attacks!
 Dao Sovereign and the other two followed Lao Dan. Han Jue knew this and didn’t find it strange.
 However, why were Ancestor Xitian, Li Daokong, and Shi Dudao fighting with the Heavenly Court and the Great Dao Tower?
 Han Jue had previously learned from Shi Dudao as the Dark Forbidden Lord. Now, he and Li Daokong listened to Ancestor Xitian’s orders. The three of them brought a large number of Life Servants and attacked everywhere to strengthen the Life faction.
 Life’s attacks looked savage, but they were actually targeting the helpless experts.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor seemed to have a wide network, but the Chaos was almost infinite. The Heavenly Court was powerful, but their wars were only small battles in the Chaos.
 Their only reliable ally was the Great Dao Tower. Thus, they were immediately implicated and beaten up together.
 Han Jue thought for a moment and decided to visit Ancestor Xitian in his dreams.
 Ancestor Xitian had fallen into such a state because of his identity as the Dark Forbidden Lord. Han Jue didn’t dare to be sure if Ancestor Xitian really thought that he was the Dark Forbidden Lord. He still had a good impression of him.
 Before the calamity, in the entire Heavenly Dao, only Ancestor Xitian was worthy of Han Jue’s identity as an expert.
 The Dark Nightmare was successfully used. Han Jue used his true body to meet Ancestor Xitian.
 The dream was the Great Ultimate Hall from back then.
  Ancestor Xitian opened his eyes and looked at the huge bright hall in a daze.
 The Great Ultimate Hall was very lively every time it opened. The Dao Seekers sat in the hall and looked at him with admiration.
 Thousands of listeners disappeared, leaving only one person.
 Han Jue.
 Ancestor Xitian looked at him. Both of them had calm expressions.
 Han Jue cupped his hands and bowed. “The Dao of Karma that the ancestor taught more than a million years ago has benefited me greatly.”
 Ancestor Xitian shook his head slightly and smiled. “You’re still so cautious. No matter what your cultivation level is, you haven’t cultivated the Dao of Karma at all. How can you benefit from it?”
 Han Jue was only being polite. He suddenly didn’t know how to reply after hearing Ancestor Xitian’s words.


 “Are you here for the Heavenly Court and the Great Dao Tower?” Ancestor Xitian asked.
 His tone was casual as if he was chatting with an old friend.
 Han Jue said, “That’s right. Life abducted the Heavenly Dao Sages one after another and now, he attacked the Heavenly Emperor and my disciple. I can’t sit by and watch.”
 Ancestor Xitian narrowed his eyes and asked, “So, you’re here to warn me?”
 Han Jue shook his head. “How can I dare to warn you? I’m just puzzled. Ancestor, why did you enter Life?”
 Ancestor Xitian said, “Because there’s no place for me in the Chaos.”
 Han Jue asked, “Then, why can Life tolerate
  you?”
 This question had many meanings.
 Han Jue was very puzzled. Wasn’t Life also threatening the Chaos? Why didn’t the Chaotic Deities interfere? Would the Chaotic Deities let Ancestor Xitian go once Life took him in?
 Could it be that the Chaotic Deities were behind Life?
 However, he had calculated before that the First Life Black Sovereign had no backing.
 Ancestor Xitian stared at Han Jue with a deep gaze, as if he could see through him.
 Han Jue understood calmly.
 Now that even the Chaotic Deities could not attack his Dao Field, he was really not too afraid.
 However, it was naturally a good thing to reduce some trouble.
 Ancestor Xitian said faintly, “Perhaps this is a trap. Life is in it and doesn’t know. I took advantage of the situation and lived. At least, there was an additional chance of survival.”
 Han Jue heard a hint of sorrow.
 It was a pity.
 If not for the system and the Dao Field, he would have to face such a tragic scene.
 Ancestor Xitian suddenly laughed. His laughter was filled with disdain.
 Han Jue showed a frown.
 After Ancestor Xitian finished laughing, he shook his head and said, “I didn’t expect this. I didn’t expect this. I’ve presided over the Heavenly Dao for billions of years and preached the Dao to countless Dao Seekers. Now, I’m being pitied by a junior who once asked me for guidance. How tragic and unfortunate is this?”
 “However, it’s worth it to have one person dare to take me in. I didn’t preach the Dao for nothing.”
 [Ancestor Xitian’s favorability towards you has increased. Current favorability: 5 stars]
 As he declared war, his favorability increased?
 Han Jue was confused.
 Han Jue frowned. Was he hinting at the Chaotic Deities?
 Would he be considered to have cut ties with him if he went to fight Ancestor Xitian?
 “By the way, let me remind you. Previously, I only left a clone in the Heavenly Dao. I’ve been suppressing my cultivation. You have to use your full strength if you want to fight
 me.”
 Han Jue opened his eyes.
 The ancestor could actually forcefully break through his Dark Nightmare!
 He checked Ancestor Xitian’s portrait and discovered that his cultivation level was still at the mid-stage Great Dao Primordial Chaos Realm.
 Could this be a disguise?
 Han Jue asked in his mind, “If Ancestor Xitian uses his full strength, can I insta-kill him?”
 (300 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Not bad!
 Continue!
 [Yes]
 Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief.
 No.
 Not stable enough.
 “If Ancestor Xitian uses his full strength, can he insta-kill me?”
 [No]
 He hesitated.
 Should he go?
 “If I go and stop Ancestor Xitian, will I be attacked by the Chaotic Deities and the Great Dao Supreme?” Han Jue asked in his mind. It would have been fine if it was in the past.
 Now, he was a little angry at Ancestor Xitian’s unclear words.
 (i quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?)
 Continue!
 [No]
 At the same time, he despised the First Life Black Sovereign. This fellow was hiding in the dark. He didn’t dare to show himself even when his subordinates were killed.
 Han Jue looked at the Chaos and quickly found the battlefield where the Heavenly Court, the Great Dao Tower, and Life were fighting
 The universe where the Great Dao Tower was located was in chaos.
 The immortals of the Heavenly Court and the cultivators of the Great Dao Tower were fighting countless Life Servants.
 The number of Life Servants was not less than the number of living beings in the Heavenly Court and the Great Dao Tower. In fact, there were even more.
 Li Daokong was fighting Zhou Fan. The two were on par.
 Shi Dudao fought the Evil Heavenly Emperor, but he was suppressed.
 As for Ancestor Xitian, he was above the entire battlefield. He sat in the void and kept casting spells with both hands. His vast Dharmic powers transformed into huge chains that trapped a terrifying black shadow.
 The Inauspicious Divine Emperor!
 Han Jue was curious. What was the relationship between the Evil Heavenly Emperor and the Inauspicious Divine Emperor? Why did he always help him?
 Could it be the Evil Heavenly Emperor’s father!
 However, the Inauspicious Evil was not a living being. How could it have children?
 The Inauspicious Divine Emperor was clearly not Ancestor Xitian’s match. Ancestor Xitian did not kill him either, as if he was waiting for someone.
 Han Jue knew that Ancestor Xitian was waiting for him.
 Clearly, if Ancestor Xitian was serious, this battle would have ended long ago. It wouldn’t have lasted so long.
 Ancestor Xitian was forcing him to appear.
 ClangLi Daokong slashed at the Great Dao Tower, causing a violent sound wave that shook the void.
 Zhou Fan held the Great Dao Tower and cursed, “Li Daokong, you’re f*cking ruthless! Can you act well?”
 Li Daokong shook his sword and tilted his head to look at him with a smile. “Didn’t you brag about your Great Dao Tower? I want to see if your Great Dao Tower can block my Sword Dao!”
 On the other side, Shi Dudao was even more furious. The Evil Heavenly Emperor did not use a Supreme Treasure and entirely relied on his great Dharmic powers to suppress him, making him very aggrieved.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor ignored Shi Dudao’s anger and focused on Ancestor Xitian.
 “Ancestor, what are you waiting for?” The Evil Heavenly Emperor thought to himself. He could sense that Ancestor Xitian was only acting, so he did not dare to rashly kill Shi Dudao.
  His greatest trump card, the Inauspicious Divine Emperor, was not Ancestor Xitian’s match. He had no chance of winning.
 He was puzzled, but he couldn’t ask directly. The soldier’s morale would take a blow once he did.
 “Roar!”
 The Inauspicious Divine Emperor roared again. He suddenly dispersed, and Ancestor Xitian’s Dharmic powers chain missed.
 Immediately after, a black shadow appeared behind Ancestor Xitian. It was the Inauspicious Divine Emperor.
 The Inauspicious Divine Emperor transformed into darkness and drowned Ancestor Xitian.
 The darkness shattered like a glass ball. Ancestor Xitian appeared and raised his right hand, causing a golden river to appear.
 Ancestor Xitian muttered a strange sound, causing the golden river to emit a strong light and suck all the surrounding dark fragments into the river.


 After Ancestor Xitian sealed the Inauspicious Divine Emperor in the golden river in his palm, he continued to cast spells with his left hand. Seals struck the golden river in his right hand, looking dazzling.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor widened his eyes.
 Impossible!
 Wasn’t Ancestor Xitian also a Great Dao Sage?
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor suddenly felt that Ancestor Xitian was so unfamiliar.
 The previous ancestor had hidden his cultivation in the Heavenly Dao?
 The Inauspicious Divine Emperor was sealed. No one was restraining Ancestor Xitian. Would he stop waiting and start a massacre?
  At this moment.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor suddenly thought of Han Jue.
 Should he ask him for help?
 At this moment…
 Ancestor Xitian suddenly turned to look into the darkness.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor, who had been staring at him, couldn’t help but look over.
 There was nothing in the darkness.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor couldn’t sense any reinforcements.
 Li Daokong used the Ten Thousand Life Sword. Countless injuries, equipment, and meteors transformed into sword shadows that faced Zhou Fan.
 “Zhou Fan, do you want to beg for mercy?” Li Daokong asked teasingly.
 Zhou Fan flew into a rage out of humiliation and cursed, “What? You still want to kill me?”
 Li Daokong smiled. “How is that possible? We are old friends, after all. However, you see the situation.”
 He was in a good mood. Not only did he bully Zhou Fan, but more importantly, he saw Shi Dudao being beaten.
 Shi Dudao was beaten, while he had the upper hand!
 Compared to the two, he was even more powerful. How could he not be happy?
 Outside the Heavenly Dao, Han Jue appeared on the Chaotic Heavenly Road.
 He looked at the Dark Forbidden Zone and slowly raised his right hand.
 “Ancestor, you want to fight? Unfortunately, I’m not going easy on you. I should distance myself from you to prevent me from insta-killing you.”
 The shadows of Fiendcelestials appeared above Han Jue’s head and entered his body.
 Dharma Idol Fusion Technique!
 After fusing about fifty Dharma Idols, Han Jue stretched out his index finger and condensed the Primordial Divine Rage. Then, he shot out the Heaven Earth Mystic Yellow World Piercing Sword Finger.
 Boom
 A terrifying sword Qi tore through the darkness, drawing an endless white line that stretched into the depths of the Chaos.
 Han Jue turned around.
 Pan Xin and Sect Master Tian Jue appeared in front of him. Pan Xin asked nervously, “Are there enemies?”
 Sect Master Tian Jue was also extremely nervous.
 To be able to force Han Jue to attack personally, the other party was definitely very strong. He was at least a Great Dao Sage!
 Han Jue smiled. “There are no powerful enemies. Someone just challenged me in the Great Dao Tower.”
 Great Dao Tower?
 Pan Xin and Sect Master Tian Jue were stunned. They looked at each other and saw the disbelief in each other’s eyes.
 The Great Dao Tower was very far from the Heavenly Dao. Even a Freedom Sage could not arrive in a short period of time.
 Han Jue attacked from so far away?
 They couldn’t imagine how high his cultivation was.
 Han Jue disappeared and returned to the Daoist temple. He sat on the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus and continued cultivating.
 Great Dao Tower Domain.
 The high and mighty Ancestor Xitian suddenly said, “Stop!”
 In an instant, all the Life Servants stopped fighting and looked up at him.
 Li Daokong and Shi Dudao also stopped.
 The immortals and cultivators of the Great Dao Tower hurriedly retreated and caught their breaths.
 All the living beings looked up at Ancestor Xitian like ants looking at the sky.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor frowned and felt inexplicably uneasy.
 What was Ancestor Xitian trying to do?
 At this moment!
 All the living beings felt an extremely terrifying pressure descend, causing their souls to tremble.
 Including the Evil Heavenly Emperor, Shi Dudao, Li Daokong, and Zhou Fan!
 A sense of fear and insignificance when facing absolute power enveloped them.
 They subconsciously turned around. Before their gazes could reach him, a sword Qi illuminated the void and collided with Ancestor Xitian with an unstoppable force!
 Shocking!
 It shook space and time!
 Ancestor Xitian’s eyes widened as his white hair was blown back.
 Sword light flashed in the eyes of all living beings. Even their Sage Sense was isolated!
 After the sword light dissipated, the Evil Heavenly Emperor was the first to look up.
 The sword Qi dissipated and a huge hole appeared in the darkness. The dark purple alternate space-time was like a cosmic beast opening its bloody mouth. It was terrifying.
 Ancestor Xitian floated in the air. His hair was disheveled and his back was hunched. His head was lowered, but his slightly floating back proved that he was still alive.
 Soon, all the living beings regained their senses. They looked up and gasped when they saw Ancestor Xitian’s state.
 Especially the Life Servants, they were terrified.
 Zhou Fan and the Evil Heavenly Emperor looked at each other.
 They guessed the truth.
 Han Jue made his move!
 Ancestor Xitian’s weak voice sounded, “Retreat.”
 He stood up and walked into the darkness.
 Li Daokong smiled at Zhou Fan and said, “If we fight again, be careful that I won’t snatch your Great Dao Tower. Stop pretending in the future!”
 “Hmph!”
 Zhou Fan was very unhappy, but he had nothing to say. Shi Dudao looked at the Evil Heavenly Emperor deeply, leading countless servants to chase after Ancestor Xitian.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor and Zhou Fan did not order a pursuit.
 No one noticed that the corners of Ancestor Xitian’s mouth curled up slightly. He sighed and said in a voice that only he could hear, “The younger generation has surpassed us.”
 …
 Inside the Daoist temple.
 Han Jue was a little surprised. Although he had held back, he didn’t expect Ancestor Xitian to still be able to protect his body.
 However, it was fine. Han Jue had only fused with fifty Dharma Idols.
 Even ten Ancestor Xitian would be destroyed in body and soul if he fused with the power of more than a thousand Dharma Idols!
 [Ancestor Xitian’s favorability towards you has increased. Current favorability: 6 stars]
 A notification suddenly appeared in front of him, making Han Jue speechless.
 No matter what, the crisis of the Heavenly Court and the Great Dao Tower was resolved.
 Han Jue thought of how Chu Shiren had also encountered something and his soul was imprisoned.
  He sent him a dream.
 In the dream, he was under the Fusang Tree. Perhaps because he was affected by the Evil Heavenly Emperor, Han Jue always had some feelings when he visited.
 Chu Shiren opened his eyes and hurriedly knelt down when he saw it was him.
 Han Jue asked, “Is there trouble?”
 Chu Shiren was stunned. He hesitated for a moment and nodded slightly.
 “Why don’t you use the Invocation Technique?”
 “I don’t want to trouble Grandmaster about my grand-disciple’s matter. I will naturally look for you if an existence with high seniority crosses the line. However, the other party is only a Freedom Sage. I think it’d be bullying if I asked for your help.”
 Chu Shiren spoke very seriously. Han Jue wanted to laugh. He said, “Then, aren’t you afraid of death?”
 Chu Shiren said, “No, I still want to subdue him and make him the Buddha World’s Buddha!”
 Han Jue asked, “What makes you so arrogant?”


 “I’m not arrogant. I want to use Great Kindness to reform him!” Chu Shiren said firmly. It had to be said that after establishing the Buddhist World, he became more and more like Buddha. When he said such righteous words, he was dazzling and made people want to trust him.
 Han Jue said, “Don’t go overboard.”
 Chu Shiren said, “Don’t worry, Grandmaster. When the Hidden Sect unifies the Chaos, my Buddhist World will bring peace to the Hidden Sect!”
 “What nonsense are you saying? When will the Hidden Sect unite the Chaos?”
 “I’m wrong. The Heavenly Dao will unite the Chaos…”
 “The Heavenly Dao will not unite the Chaos. It only wants to protect itself, understand?” Han Jue said seriously. He felt that Chu Shiren was thinking wrongly.
 Chu Shiren hurriedly apologized, “Yes! Yes! Protect yourself!”
 He sighed.
 Grandmaster was still the most shameless.
  The development of the Heavenly Dao was not about self-preservation. It was clearly ambitious.
 However, this was the true goal.
 He was lying through his teeth.
 Han Jue chatted with Chu Shiren for a while more before removing the dream.
 Inside the Daoist temple.
 Han Jue felt despair at the prosperity of the Hundred Peak Immortal River and suddenly felt so unfamiliar.
 It looked lively, but he felt lonely.
 His disciples had all grown up and no longer relied on him.
 “You’re not sensible. Your master finally became stronger and has a high cultivation level, but you actually didn’t give me a chance to show off.”
 Han Jue sighed, then restrained his emotions and continued cultivating.
 He was indeed powerful, but he was not invincible.
 Ten thousand Divine Authority Generals were his greatest enemy now.
 Perhaps the Dao Field could block them, but that would be a huge matter. The entire Chaos would definitely pay attention to his Dao Field and his disciples outside would not be safe.
 Outside the 33rd Heaven, in the Universal Hall, the Sages gathered.
 The Sages gathered around Pan Xin. He was flattering Han Jue.
 “To attack from the Heavenly Dao and kill the enemies of the Great Dao Tower from afar, can you really do it?”
 Yang Che couldn’t help but ask. He had also been to the Great Dao Tower. He was still a Pseudo-Sage at that time and had spent more than twenty thousand years on the trip.
 It was obvious how far the Heavenly Dao was from the Great Dao Tower.
 The Heavenly Dao was already vast enough. It contained billions of universes and countless space-time. Every mortal world could evolve into a Great Universe and produce countless galaxies. The thought that a Sage could cover the Heavenly Dao. This was what was called omnipotent in the eyes of all living beings.
 However, the Chaos was endless. Even Sages could only spy on a small portion.
 Han Jue’s performance was unbelievable.
 Pan Xin glared at Yang Che and said, “Of course. Fellow Daoist Han is a Great Dao Sage. You are only Primordial Chaos Zenith Heaven Golden Immortals with the Freedom Sage Realm above you. How can you imagine how powerful a Great Dao Sage is? Furthermore, Fellow Daoist Han is almost invincible among the Great Dao Sages!”
 Co
 Li Taigu nodded excitedly. “That’s right. I even feel that Senior Han is already the strongest existence, just like the Dao Ancestor in the past. Therefore, the Heavenly Dao did not encounter any more enemies. Many Chaotic Worlds are even fawning over the Heavenly Dao. Isn’t this because of Senior Han’s powerful strength?”
 Zhang Guxing stroked his beard and sighed in his heart.
 At this moment, Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du appeared. The Sages sat back down.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du scanned the surroundings and said, “I just learned that the Heavenly Court and the Great Dao Tower were attacked by the Life faction led by Ancestor Xitian, Shi Dudao, and Li Daokong. Fortunately, the Heavenly Dao Divine Might Heavenly Sage took action and almost killed Ancestor Xitian with a single strike. The Life faction was defeated. This battle caused the Heavenly Dao to shake the Chaos. The Life factions near the Heavenly Dao retreated and are no longer probing for information about the Heavenly Dao.”
 The Sages were in an uproar.
 Pan Xin was smug. You still don’t believe me?
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du smiled and said, “This battle has once again made the Heavenly Dao famous. This is not the first time Fellow Daoist Han has severely injured the Life faction. The name of the Divine Might Heavenly Sage will definitely spread even wider in the future. The Heavenly Dao will also benefit from this. I brought all of you here this time to spread some legends about the Divine Might Heavenly Sage. This time, my goal is the Chaos. In any case, the grudge between the Heavenly Dao and the Life faction is already irreconcilable. There’s no need to be wary. We can turn the Divine Might Heavenly Sage into a guardian of the Chaotic Order. The Life faction will definitely lose at the Divine Might Heavenly Sage’s feet.”
 The old Sages nodded, while the new Sages felt strange.
 So those legends were deliberately spread by Sages?
 Yang Che felt that the faces of the Sages were so ugly, but he felt very good when he participated
 This feeling of dominating all living beings was too wonderful!
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du began to talk about the various battle achievements of the Divine Might Heavenly Sage. It was very exciting, as if it was all true.
 Fang Liang and Su Qi had strange expressions. If they didn’t know Han Jue’s personality, they would have thought that it was true.
 After a long time.

 “I called you here today because of something else. The Divine Robe Daoist told me that he wants to give the Heavenly Dao an opportunity. It’s a Chaotic Sea of Fire. This sea of fire is extraordinary and contains the Qi of Creation. It can be used to forge Supreme Treasures. The Heavenly Dao will attract countless Chaotic Cultivators to create Dharma treasures if we can control this sea,” Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said slowly.
 Xu Dudao clapped his hands and said, “This is a good thing! But can we believe the Divine Robe Daoist? Doesn’t he want such an opportunity for himself?”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “The Great Dao Divine Spirits can’t directly control creation, or it will be considered crossing the line. However, it will definitely benefit him if he controls the Heavenly Dao. It’s equivalent to indirectly belonging to him.”
 The Sages fell into deep thought.
 Heavenly Venerate Wufa said, “You can agree. Although the Heavenly Dao is willing to accept Chaotic living beings, we will only accept those who are in trouble. If you want to attract geniuses or mighty figures, you have to have something that truly tempts them. It can’t just be the right to stay in the Heavenly Dao.”
  The other Sages nodded, but they were still worried about the Divine Robe Daoist. After all, he was once an enemy.
 “Leave this matter to me. I have a better chance of escaping than you even if the Divine Robe Daoist has a plan!” Pan Xin said.
 He really knew how to take advantage of the situation!
 The Sages cursed silently, but they did not dare to snatch this opportunity. It was indeed too dangerous.
 The Heavenly Dao Sages’ immortality was only in the Heavenly Dao. Most of the time, they would not leave the Heavenly Dao.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “That’s settled.”
 Seeing Heavenly Venerate Wufa speak, Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du felt at ease.
 They were all family. Why should they suspect each other? Of course, he did not dare to say this.
 Because he didn’t know what method Han Jue used to make the enemy willing to be his slave. This method was definitely not simple. Once he was exposed, he would definitely offend Han Jue.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du had always been careful around Han Jue. The two of them seemed to have a good relationship, but Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du never dared to relax.
