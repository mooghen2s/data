 After chatting with the Evil Heavenly Emperor for a long time, the dream ended.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and took a deep breath.
 He looked at his hands and felt his powerful Dharmic powers.
 He was indeed very powerful. In a daze, he even thought that he was already invincible.
 However, he couldn’t be arrogant when he thought of the Chaotic Consciousness and Ancestor Xitian’s miserable state!
 Han Jue immediately entered the simulation trial and prepared to wake up.
 An hour later.
  He gave up on the simulation trial.
 No, not only did he not calm down, but he also became more arrogant.
 Han Jue thought silently.
 He felt that Life should be at the Great Dao Sage Realm. Otherwise, why would he need a bet to subdue the Heavenly Court?
 He adjusted his state of mind and continued cultivating.
 …
 Chaos, Heavenly Court.
 In the Numinous Palace, Zhou Fan brought a group of generals over, including Qin Ling.
 Han Tuo nodded slightly when he saw him.
 Qin Ling was the same.
 Of course, in terms of potential, Qin Ling felt that he was not inferior to Han Tuo!
 He would still work hard to fulfill Grandmaster Han Yu’s expectations and surpass him!
 Zhou Fan chuckled. “Your Majesty, you really don’t want to rest for a moment. You just defeated a Chaotic Fiendcelestial and now you’re fighting Life? Your battle can be said to have spread throughout the Chaos.”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor shook his head. “I’m not the one causing trouble. It was Life who provoked us. He was probably the one who spread the rumors.”
 Zhou Fan’s smile vanished as he said seriously, “I also feel that something is wrong. You brought all the elites of the Great Dao Tower. I’ll support you regardless of success or failure!”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor stood up and came in front of him. He patted his shoulder and smiled. “I didn’t expect my confidant to be a Heavenly Soldier under me.”
 Zhou Fan rolled his eyes. This fellow liked to do this before others, causing Zhou Fan to always bow down to him.
 “Don’t you know my personality? How can I not support you?”
 The two of them looked at each other and laughed.
 The Great Dao Tower’s generals and the Heavenly Court’s immortals smiled.
 The Chaos was endless. After many battles, the two forces could already rely on each other and treat each other as brothers.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor smiled. “Yes, of course. The Heavenly Court is not the only one threatened. If we win, it will be a good opportunity to show our Heavenly Court’s might. If we lose, the other factions will feel threatened too.”
 Zhou Fan nodded and sighed.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor was the one who truly did great things. Although he, Zhou Fan, had pulled together a force, he was more like a king. He did not have the Evil Heavenly Emperor’s spirit or his foresight.
 If he was the Evil Heavenly Emperor, he would probably be worried that the other factions would add insult to injury.
 Just like that, the cultivators of the Great Dao Tower stayed in the Heavenly Court.
 Zhou Fan pulled Han Tuo, Chu Shiren, and Qin Ling together. It was a gathering of fellow disciples.
 Some mocked the Evil Heavenly Emperor for being stupid and arrogant, while others admired his guts and situation. There were all sorts of attitudes.
 But they only had one true goal.
 They wanted to know Life’s strength!
 Behind the Numinous Palace, in a floating stone pavilion, the Evil Heavenly Emperor and an old Daoist were chatting.
 It was the guide of the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End.
 The creator of the Heavenly Dao Buddhist Sect.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor shook his head. “I’m only messing around. My cultivation level is not high enough.”
 Jie Yin asked, “How’s your father?”
 Hearing this, the Evil Heavenly Emperor’s eyes turned cold, but he quickly restrained himself. He smiled and said, “What’s wrong? It’s already a huge blessing that he can transform into an Inauspicious Evil and still survive.”
 “Back then, your father was the most outstanding prodigy of the True Dragon Race. His reputation was also spread in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End. However, he encountered an accident in the Dark Forbidden Zone…”
 Jie Yin narrowed his eyes. “Don’t worry. I’ve already informed the Heavenly Lord of Primordial Beginning, Nüwa, Fuxitian, and the twelve Ancestral Magi. Life is too arrogant. He even threatened us earlier.”
 Heavenly Court was not the first to be threatened. Instead, the Great Dao Sages in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End were provoked one after another.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor said in a low voice, “Senior, what do you think is Life’s motive? No matter what I think, I feel that he’s courting death by doing this. It would be fine if he attacked us one by one, but he actually provoked all the famous factions in the Chaos, looking down on even the Chaotic Fiendcelestials.”
 Jie Yin said, “If we were in his shoes, we wouldn’t be able to see what benefits he can obtain. There’s only one reason. He’s only a pawn. He’s not fighting for himself.”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor frowned.
 A pawn?
 …
 Three thousand years passed.
 Han Jue opened his eyes. He suddenly felt a little anxious.
 Previously, in his dream, he had taught the Invocation Technique to the Evil Heavenly Emperor. When the time came, the Evil Heavenly Emperor would summon him.
 Unable to cultivate in peace, Han Jue began the simulation trial.
 He directly set up a hundred Ancestor Xitian to fight him and see if he could win.
 No matter how strong Life was, he would still fight a Great Dao Sage one-on-one. Would he dare to face the siege of a hundred Great Dao Sages?
 Then…
 Han Jue was killed.
 A hundred Ancestor Xitians attacking at the same time was indeed ridiculously strong.
 However, this also stimulated his fighting spirit.
 Just like that, Han Jue waited for the Evil Heavenly Emperor to visit him in his dreams while immersed in the simulation trial.
 In the mysterious space, Li Daokong and Shi Dudao, who were still meditating in the pool, opened their eyes at the same time.
 A beam of light appeared in front of them, reflecting the scene of the Heavenly Court.
 “I will subdue the Heavenly Court and let you see how powerful the power of darkness is!”
 Life’s voice sounded. It was illusory and could not be tracked.
 Li Daokong frowned.
 He knew very well the relationship between the Heavenly Court and the Hidden Sect. Furthermore, he had a very good relationship with the Evil Heavenly Emperor.
 Shi Dudao suddenly asked, “You’ve been mentioning the power of darkness. Other than Life, is Darkness also a force?”


 “You’re smart. That’s right. Darkness is indeed a force, an unimaginable force! One day, you will be grateful to me. I’ll let you transcend. I’ll let you obtain the glory that surpasses the Chaos!”
 Life laughed wildly.
 Li Daokong could tell that this was the Life who had suppressed them.
 These people had different personalities. Some were arrogant, some were silent, some were cold, and some were murderous.
 Shi Dudao pondered.
 Darkness was a force…
  Shi Dudao smiled after he thought it through.
 Life’s laughter vanished.
 Li Daokong looked at the light for a while and glanced at Shi Dudao, who was still snickering. He asked, “What’s wrong? You were devoured by the power of darkness? You’ve already changed into a different person?”
 Hearing this, Shi Dudao glared at him and snorted. “What do you know? Kid, you benefited from me. You have to repay me in the future!”
 “How can I benefit from you?”
 “Hehe.”
 Shi Dudao smiled and did not say anything.
 Li Daokong cursed silently.
 This fellow was definitely crazy.
 No, he had always been mentally unstable.
 Li Daokong looked at the light again.
 He looked worried, not knowing if the Heavenly Court could survive this.
 In a pavilion in the Heavenly Court.
 Han Tuo was meditating and cultivating. His slightly frowned brows represented the uneasiness in his heart.
 He looked confident on the surface, but he was also afraid of losing at dealing with a terrifying existence that even a Chaotic Fiendcelestial couldn’t subdue.
 He would let down the Heavenly Court if he lost.
 Han Tuo kept adjusting his emotions.
 When Han Jue was still a mortal, when the sect and the family were in trouble, he even dared to stand up.
 At that time, Han Jue was alone.
 The current Han Tuo still had the support of the entire Heavenly Court.
 Han Tuo’s brows gradually relaxed.
 This battle was not only the rise and fall of the Heavenly Court but also the battle that would make him famous in the Chaos!
 If he won, his name would shake the Chaos!
 He could only win! “Tsk tsk tsk—”
 A strange laugh suddenly sounded and resounded throughout the Heavenly Court. Han Tuo opened his eyes.
 Life?
 “Evil Heavenly Emperor, are you ready! The prodigy I brought is already hungry. I hope your prodigy can let him eat his fill!”
 With that said, a deafening roar resounded throughout the Heavenly Court.
 The space at the edge of the Heavenly Court facing the Numinous Palace had already been torn apart. A burly figure fifty feet tall slowly stepped out.
 He was like a human and had three heads and six arms. He wore heavy black armor embedded with spikes. The flesh under the armor seemed to have been burned by fire. His face was ugly and blood seemed to overflow from his body at any time. His eyes were dark green and his pupils could not be seen.
 A terrifying murderous aura erupted and wrapped around his body like a tornado. A terrifying holy might filled the Heavenly Court, causing all living beings below the Sage Realm to shiver.
  The Evil Heavenly Emperor brought Zhou Fan and the others out of the Numinous Palace and looked at the enemy.
 The doors of the nearby palaces opened one after another. Powerful figures walked out one after another. Jie Yin, Nüwa, Fuxitian, Empress Houtu, the Heavenly Lord of Primordial Beginning, Dijun, and so on were mostly from the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End. There were also some from the unknown.
 Di Jiang also frowned. “The other party is indeed confident.”
 In front of another palace, Fuxitian, who was standing beside Nüwa, narrowed his eyes. Seeing Han Tuo’s opponent, his heart palpitated.
 Even though he was already a Freedom Sage, he did not dare to have absolute confidence in defeating the other party.
 In front of the Numinous Palace, the Evil Heavenly Emperor was expressionless, but the Heavenly Generals were a little panicked.
 VWd
 This enemy looked very terrifying!
 Qin Ling frowned and couldn’t help but worry for Han Tuo. If Han Tuo died in front of him, how could he answer to Han Yu?
 However, his strength was far inferior to Han Tuo’s. Even if Han Tuo was not his match, he did not have the strength to save him.
 “This is the Fiendcelestial Slayer, my pet. Evil Heavenly Emperor, where’s your prodigy? Did he already run away?”
 Life’s voice sounded again, still extremely arrogant. From the beginning to the end, he did not reveal himself.
 Boom
 A powerful aura erupted from a corner. The door to a hall suddenly opened and shattered.
 Han Tuo stepped out, and a golden dragon coiled up from under his feet. The dragon became larger and more handsome.
 He slowly raised his right hand, and a spear that shone with a strong light appeared in his hand.
 Under the sunlight, Han Tuo, who had inherited some of Han Jue’s looks, wore divine armor and looked high-spirited. It suited the image of a Divine General in all living beings’ minds.
 The Fiendcelestial Slayer suddenly turned his head and glared at Han Tuo. His heavy breathing carried a scorching aura, causing space to twist.
 Han Tuo stared at the Fiendcelestial Slayer fearlessly.
 In an instant, the entire Heavenly Court was forgotten. They only had eyes for each other!
 “Divine General Han!” a Heavenly General suddenly shouted. Immediately after, tens of millions of Heavenly troops shouted in unison.
 “Divine General Han!”
 “Divine General Han!”
 “Divine General Han!”
 The various factions were calm. They cared more about Life.
 Filled with the aura of an emperor, Dijun took out a book and searched through it.
 He was not the only one. The other mighty figures were also secretly looking for Life.
 The Fiendcelestial Slayer suddenly roared angrily and vanished. The terrifying power shattered space.
 Almost instantly, Han Jue also disappeared. His chamber shook violently.
 Boom
 The two figures collided in the void. Two domineering forces collided, causing a visible fluctuation in the sky.
  In front of the Fiendcelestial Slayer, Han Tuo looked very short, but his golden dragon supported his aura.
 “This power…”
 Han Tuo had a sinister expression, but he was a little shocked.
 The Fiendcelestial Slayer immediately attacked. His six arms bombarded Han Tuo like cannonballs. Not displaying any Mystical Powers, he relied solely on his physical strength.
 Han Tuo waved his spear and borrowed the force. His speed was extremely fast.
 Soon, Han Tuo couldn’t take it anymore and had no choice but to move. The Fiendcelestial Slayer followed closely behind. The two sides kept moving, forming billions of afterimages in the sky. It was as if billions of people were fighting in the sky, like a war! “Not good,” Zhou Fan whispered as he stood in front of the Evil Heavenly Emperor. His hands in his sleeves clenched into fists, ready to attack at any time.
 If Han Tuo died here, he might as well kill himself. He would be too ashamed to face Han Jue.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor said calmly, “What’s the hurry? This is only the beginning.”


 Not only was his strength inferior, but so was his speed.
 Han Tuo had no choice but to use his Mystical Power. He struck out with his left palm, using the Great Freedom Heaven Imprisoning Palm. The palm shadow instantly expanded and struck the Fiendcelestial Slayer, suppressing
 it.
 The powerful Great Freedom Heaven Imprisoning Palm sealed the Fiendcelestial Slayer’s body, preventing him from moving. His strong body pierced through layers of clouds.
 This scene surprised everyone.
 “What a powerful technique!”
  “This palm has the profundity of the Great Dao.”
 “He’s indeed a prodigy!”
 “The Heavenly Court is indeed filled with hidden talents. No wonder it can quickly
 rise!”
 “Interesting.”
 Standing beside Nüwa, Fuxitian sighed. “If it were an ordinary Primordial Chaos Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal, they would probably be directly suppressed. This Fiendcelestial Slayer is indeed impressive.”
 The descending Fiendcelestial Slayer suddenly roared. His six arms shook angrily and directly shattered the Great Freedom Heaven Imprisoning Palm.
 Boom
 Han Tuo swooped down with his spear like a golden rainbow, splitting the entire Heavenly Court into two. His unstoppable spear pierced through the Fiendcelestial Slayer’s chest.
 The Fiendcelestial Slayer fell again.
 “Roar!”
 The Fiendcelestial Slayer roared angrily. Its three faces were sinister like ghosts, ghastly and terrifying Two of his arms suddenly grabbed the spear, and the remaining four arms attacked Han Tuo again.
 Han Tuo immediately rubbed his spear with both hands. His Dharmic powers turned into a strong wind and minced the hands of the Fiendcelestial Slayer. Blood splattered.
 The Fiendcelestial Slayer suddenly flashed and appeared behind Han Tuo. He kicked down like a mountain pressing down, causing Han Tuo’s body to bleed and shatter.
 In the next second, Han Tuo’s body gathered again. He turned around and stabbed with his spear.
 The Fiendcelestial Slayer used his chest to receive this spear. The six new palms struck Han Tuo crazily.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor stared at Han Tuo. Zhou Fan, Yi Tian, Chu Shiren, and Qin Ling were the same.
 Yi Tian blinked and cursed. “It’s too fast. I can’t see clearly. Who has the upper hand?”
 Zhou Fan said with a solemn expression, “It’s hard to say, but this Fiendcelestial can’t be killed at all.”
 However, he encountered a monster.
 The Fiendcelestial Slayer reminded Zhou Fan of the Chaotic Fiendcelestial.
 It was the same difficult to deal with, the same unkillable, and the same powerful body!
 Chu Shiren asked in a low voice, “Should we contact Grandmaster?”
 If it was anyone else, he naturally wouldn’t say that. But this was Han Jue’s son.
 Zhou Fan said in a low voice, “Go tell him. At least let him know about this.”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor glanced at them and found it strange.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor didn’t stop him. It was a good opportunity for Han Jue to be prepared in case something happened suddenly.
 Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 Han Jue had already stayed in the simulation trial for 32 years.
 The Black Hell Chicken’s voice came from outside the Daoist temple, “Master! Something happened to your son!”
 Han Jue left the simulation trial and asked, “What is it?”
 The Black Hell Chicken gave a simple introduction. Life attacked the Heavenly Court. Han Tuo was fighting a mysterious powerful enemy.
 “Got it,” Han Jue replied and the Black Hell Chicken left.
 Strange.
 The Heavenly Emperor had yet to use the Invocation Technique, so why did Chu Shiren send a message first?
 Could it be that the Heavenly Emperor did not tell Chu Shiren about the plan?
 Very likely. How could he tell others about such a plan?
 Han Jue was not in a hurry and waited for the Evil Heavenly Emperor to use the Invocation Technique.
 “Will I die if I go to the Heavenly Court now?” Han Jue asked silently.
 (200 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 (There’s a trace of the possibility of death.]
 A trace?
 Han Jue’s heart tightened and he asked, “Is there anyone stronger than me in the Heavenly Court and nearby?” (200 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [No]
 Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief.
 That trace of possibility should be his carelessness.
 Han Jue couldn’t wait anymore.
 However, the Evil Heavenly Emperor had yet to use the Invocation Technique.
 He stood up and began to stretch his muscles. He did a set of national movements that he had learned in his previous life.
 This action was naturally useless to a Great Dao Sage. He was only killing time.
 In the Heavenly Court, the sounds of battle continued. The sky was already riddled with holes. Space-time lightning interwove and darkness transformed into spots that dotted the space in all directions of the Heavenly Court.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor frowned.
 If this continued, Han Tuo would probably lose.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor began to hesitate if he should summon Han Jue now.
 When mighty figures fought, victory and defeat usually happened in an instant. Perhaps Han Tuo could still tie with him now, but he might be killed in the next second and his body and soul would be destroyed.
 “When will His Majesty attack?”
 Nüwa’s voice suddenly entered the Evil Heavenly Emperor’s ears.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor asked with a voice transmission, “Have you found Life?”
 Nüwa replied, “I can’t be sure, but he has indeed infiltrated the Heavenly Court. It’s fine as long as the Heavenly Court’s space is sealed. At that time, if you capture him, you have to hand him over to me. My brother’s Great Dao Dao Fruit has been snatched away by him. If you want to attain the Great Dao again, you have to find this Dao Fruit.”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor frowned and sent a voice transmission, “Let’s wait a little longer. It’s best if we succeed on the first
 try.”
 Immediately after, the other mighty figures also sent voice transmissions to the Evil Heavenly Emperor. He had no choice but to appease them.
 Boom
  A violent aura suddenly erupted. Flames surged from Han Tuo’s body like a hurricane. Two vertical eyes opened on his forehead. His black hair quickly grew long and white, and a pair of fleshy wings grew on his back.
 Fiendcelestial True Body!
 The mighty figures were shocked. Someone exclaimed, “Chaotic Fiendcelestial!”
 Whoosh
 They never expected Han Tuo to be a Chaotic Fiendcelestial!
 The Fiendcelestial Slayer suddenly stopped and stared at him. “Chaotic Fiendcelestial… No, you’re the same as me!”
 Han Tuo looked down at the Fiendcelestial Slayer and said disdainfully, “So you can speak too? I thought you were a beast!”
 With that, he waved his spear. A crescent-shaped white light tore through the Heavenly Court. Space was sliced into two, and so was the Fiendcelestial Slayer’s body.


 Boom
 The Fiendcelestial Slayer tore through Han Tuo’s wings and rushed out, but he was already covered in blood.
 Han Tuo released his right hand and the divine spear spun at high speed.
 He cast a spell with both hands, and the golden dragon under his feet entered the divine spear. A black shadow rose from his body, like Han Jue’s Fiendcelestial Dharma idol.
 The black shadow also entered the divine spear. In an instant, circles of black light burst out from the divine spear, shaking the protective array formation of all the palaces.
 “What’s that?”
  “Chaotic Fiendcelestial!”
 “No, that black shadow’s aura is different from his!”
 “Could there be another Chaotic Fiendcelestial hidden in his body?”
 Perhaps Han Tuo’s strength was nothing to them, but the Chaotic Fiendcelestial was the top potential in the Chaos.
 Although Life and the Heavenly Court had defeated several Chaotic Fiendcelestials, they were either corpses or had only cultivated for a short period of time. The ancient Chaotic Fiendcelestials were still powerful existences in the Chaos. However, the Chaotic Fiendcelestials hated each other, so there were no other Chaotic Fiendcelestials supporting them.
 Han Tuo’s eyes narrowed. He stabbed the divine spear at the Fiendcelestial Slayer. The space along the way shattered and turned into absolute darkness.
 The Fiendcelestial Slayer couldn’t dodge in time and could only use his Dharmic powers to block. However, it was pierced through.
 The divine spear stopped behind him and began to absorb his Dharmic powers.
 The Fiendcelestial Slayer seemed to have been wrapped by invisible shackles and could not break free.
 “Eh, I didn’t expect you to have a Chaotic Fiendcelestial under you. No wonder you’re so confident.”
 Life’s voice sounded. Ever since the battle began, he had not said a word. Now, his tone was slightly surprised, but he still did not panic.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor laughed. “Are you prepared to admit defeat?”
 Life smiled disdainfully. “Admit defeat? Your prodigy is about to die!”
 With that, the Fiendcelestial Slayer’s roar was deafening.
 His six arms swayed crazily as he forcefully broke free from the shackles of the divine spear and pounced at Han Tuo.
 The divine spear attacked again and pierced through his body, but he ignored it and pounced at Han Tuo like a madman.
 Han Tuo waved his right hand. The spatial fragments that filled the sky turned into sword shadows and attacked the Fiendcelestial Slayer.
 Great Dao Mystical Power, Ten Thousand Life Sword!
 Han Tuo’s body was destroyed. His soul fled and reformed his body.
 Wisps of black aura appeared around him and quickly tied him up.
 His body quickly petrified, leaving only his four eyes unaffected.
 The Fiendcelestial Slayer walked over with a sinister smile. “Do you really think I don’t know a Mystical Power? There’s just no need to use it!”
 The three heads of the Fiendcelestial Slayer opened their bloody mouths. He came in front of Han Tuo and raised him high, then started to eat from his feet as stone fragments scattered.
 This scene stimulated the tens of millions of Heavenly troops. Their eyes were red. They wished they could immediately rush out.
 Zhou Fan was about to attack when the Evil Heavenly Emperor grabbed his wrist.
 He turned around and glared at him.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor was calm.
 At this moment!
 The petrified Han Tuo suddenly turned into dust, leaving only his four eyes flying away from the Fiendcelestial Slayer.
 The divine spear flew to Han Tuo’s eyes. The black shadow that had fused with the spear appeared and fused with his four eyes. It was like a black shadow that had four cold eyes.
 Having transformed into a black shadow, Han Tuo held his divine spear and walked towards the Fiendcelestial Slayer.
 The Fiendcelestial Slayer roared angrily. Wisps of black aura appeared around Han Tuo again and wanted to wrap around him. However, it was as if they were passing through an illusion. They brushed past him and could not tie him up.
 Han Tuo walked straight to the Fiendcelestial Slayer.
 At this moment, he looked even more evil than the Fiendcelestial Slayer. It was not his appearance, but his aura.
 The Great Dao Sages frowned.
 Han Tuo waved his spear and the Fiendcelestial Slayer moved behind him. However, just as it appeared, three heads fell.
 “You want to eat me? Is your stomach large enough?”
 Han Tuo’s cold voice sounded. Thousands of black lines suddenly appeared behind the black shadow. They pierced through the Fiendcelestial Slayer’s body and dispersed it, leaving his soul pierced and hanging in the sky.
 The Fiendcelestial Slayer’s soul trembled. He wanted to struggle, but he could not move.
 “What… is this…”
 The Fiendcelestial Slayer stared at Han Tuo and asked with a trembling voice.
 He couldn’t reform his body or break free.
 Han Tuo turned to look at him and said, “You are the first to withstand my Innate Mystical Power.”
 As soon as he finished speaking, Han Tuo raised his right hand. A violent suction force appeared in his palm and crazily sucked in the soul of the Fiendcelestial Slayer. Because his soul was nailed to the sky by thousands of black lines, the suction force began to tear apart the Fiendcelestial Slayer’s soul, causing soul fragments to be sucked into Han Tuo’s
 palm.
 This scene was as cruel as the scene of the Fiendcelestial Slayer devouring Han Tuo!
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor smiled and heaved a sigh of relief.
 Zhou Fan scolded jokingly. “I didn’t expect this kid to still have this move. What Mystical Power is this? It makes my heart palpitate.”
 The others also nodded. It had to be said that Han Tuo in his black shadow form was really terrifying
 “Hmph!”
 Life’s cold snort suddenly sounded. The thousands of black lines imprisoning the Fiendcelestial’s soul suddenly snapped.
 Han Tuo instinctively sensed danger and subconsciously turned around to wave his spear. However, he was dispersed by an invisible force, leaving only his four eyes in the air.
 Life attacked!
 At the same time, Great Dao Sages suddenly appeared in every corner of the Heavenly Court. They raised their hands and cast spells. Their Dharmic powers erupted and covered the entire Heavenly Court.
 The leader of the Ancestral Magi, Di Jiang, snorted. “Life, hurry up and show yourself!”
 The Heavenly Lord of Primordial Beginning, whose aura was void, held a horsetail whisk and mocked. “Is this the way Life handles a bet? You want to break the rules after losing? How embarrassing. Do you think you are worthy of ruling the Chaos?”
 “Hahaha, that’s right!”
 “I think it’s pathetic. He’s just a despicable person.”
 “Let’s see if he dares to show himself.”
 “You were so arrogant earlier, but in the end, you can’t afford to lose. How ridiculous.”
 “Let’s make a bet and see if this Life will beg for mercy?”
  The other Great Dao Sages mocked. Their laughter echoed in the Heavenly Court, even more rampant than before.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor waved his hand and moved Han Tuo to his side. The others parted and surrounded him.
 Han Tuo recovered his body. His face was pale and his aura was weak.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor looked at him and smiled. “You’ve already done well. You didn’t embarrass me.”
 The others also praised him.
 Han Tuo was indeed powerful after using his Innate Mystical Power. The Fiendcelestial Slayer could not resist him at all.
 Boom!


 “Is he finally going to attack?”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor turned around and muttered to himself as he looked at the phenomenon in the sky.
 This was the consensus of all the Great Dao Sages. They stared at the sky teasingly, waiting for Life to appear.
 “You worms born from the Chaos dare to look down on me!
 “Do you really think I don’t know why you’re here?
 “The reason why I don’t care is that I don’t care about you at all! Since you’re so arrogant, I’ll let you experience what darkness is. The Chaos will ultimately pass. The era of darkness is about to arrive. Today, I’ll kill you first. It’ll be the beginning of the dark era!”
  Life laughed wantonly as the thunder rumbled even louder.
 Everyone began to nervously wait for Life to descend.
 No matter what, he still dared to be arrogant at this time. He couldn’t be underestimated.
 On the other side.
 Li Daokong and Shi Dudao, who were in the mysterious pool, were also waiting nervously.
 They had only seen Life’s figure and had never seen his true strength.
 Shi Dudao clicked his tongue in wonder. “Let’s make a bet and see if Life can win?”
 Han Tuo’s performance just now stimulated him. He had heard from Li Daokong that Han Tuo was only 300,000 years old. Such potential was definitely far superior to his.
 It was precisely because of this that he suddenly felt that Han Jue, Han Tuo’s father, was more likely the Dark Forbidden Lord.
 He had this feeling ever since he first saw Han Jue.
 The current situation was more like a self-directed act by the Dark Forbidden Lord.
 Li Daokong said, “What do you think?”
 Li Daokong was interested and asked, “Why?”
 “You’ll know when you see it.”
 “Then I guess Life will fail.”
 “Why?”
 “The Sect Master of the Hidden Sect will not sit by and watch his son be injured. Furthermore, he has a very good relationship with the Evil Heavenly Emperor. They are like brothers.”
 Shi Dudao curled his lips and suddenly felt bored.
 It would be interesting if Li Daokong thought that Life could win.
 At the same time, the scene of the Heavenly Court in the light suddenly changed.
 The thunderclouds that filled the sky suddenly gathered into a huge face. It was impossible to estimate how big it was as it looked down on the entire Heavenly Court.
 This face only had facial features. His eyes suddenly became real. His eyes were cold and sharp, and his scarlet pupils flickered with crazy killing intent.
 “Do you know what all of this was like before the Chaos? What was it called?” Life suddenly asked with an intriguing tone.
 The hot-tempered Zhurong cursed. “If you want to fight, then fight. Do you want to wait for help?”
 With that, he punched into the sky. The flames on his body rushed into the sky like a torrent, but they were devoured by the thundercloud face.
 “Hmph, since you can’t wait, then die!”
 Life roared angrily. A rolling black aura suddenly surged out from the eyes, nose, and ears of the thundercloud face. This black aura quickly spread out in an indescribable form and instantly covered the Heavenly Court, as if night had suddenly descended.
 The Great Dao Sages used their Mystical Powers one after another, wanting to disperse the darkness, but they were shocked to discover that their Dharmic powers dissipated as soon as the darkness dissipated, as if they had encountered their natural enemy.
 “How can this be?!”
 The Heavenly Venerate frowned. He did not believe it and cast another spell, but it was still the same.
  He had no choice but to take out a wooden sword and raise it in front of him. The wooden sword emitted green light, wanting to absorb the previous black aura, but the black aura had already disappeared as if the space itself was black.
 “Go! Find him!” Di Jiang shouted in a low voice. The twelve Ancestral Magi rushed out of the palace and broke through the thundercloud face.
 The Great Dao Sages used their Mystical Powers and faced the thundercloud face. Only by destroying Life could they remove this strange power of darkness.
 At this moment, the dark power attached to the space began to spread out and sweep towards the living beings.
 The Heavenly Soldiers with lower cultivation levels could not dodge in time and were instantly drowned by the darkness, turning into black shadows.
 “Ahhh”
 “What is this?”
 “Get out of the way!”
 “I can’t block it!”
 “My Dharmic powers!”
 Screams and cries mixed together, bringing panic to the Heavenly Court.
 Yi Tian and the Black Heaven General began to arrange the Heavenly Generals to stabilize the Heavenly Soldiers.
 The darkness around the Numinous Palace also swept towards the Evil Heavenly Emperor and the others.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor waved his sleeve to block. His Dharmic powers touched the darkness and instantly perished. His expression changed drastically as he immediately moved with Han Tuo.
 The others panicked.
 How could they fight? “Tsk tsk tsk… Your Dharmic powers can only be used by me!”
 Life laughed wantonly. The thundercloud face suddenly opened its mouth and spat out twelve black shadows. They were the twelve Ancestral Magi.
 Having the strongest cultivation, Di Jiang could still prevent his head from being devoured by the darkness, but he was already exhausted. He could only stare at the thundercloud face in anger.
 The thundercloud face absorbed all the Great Dao Sages’ Mystical Powers and began to change violently. It quickly condensed into a ten thousand foot tall figure. Its body was like a horse, with its upper body being like a human. Countless arms could be seen behind it. Its face was solid and its skin was like dry bark. Its eyes were cold as it looked down on the entire Heavenly Court.
 Under the dark atmosphere, the true body that Life revealed was so terrifying.
 Jie Yin took out a wooden staff that was covered in gold, silver, and glass. It was golden and glass. He waved it at the sky, and the surrounding darkness was absorbed by the wooden staff. A bright light appeared and stood out in the entire Heavenly Court.
 Life noticed this scene and raised an arm towards him.
 Life’s hand suddenly clenched into a fist. In an instant, the surrounding darkness transformed into countless sharp claws that drowned towards Jie Yin.
 “Amitabha!”
 Jie Yin waved his wooden staff, and a golden Buddha rose from behind. His arms drew a circle and formed a Thousand-Hand Golden Buddha to resist the power of darkness. However, once it touched the power of darkness, the Golden Buddha dissipated. Seeing this, Jie Yin had no choice but to use his wooden staff to resist. Only his wooden staff could absorb the power of darkness.
 “Hmph. Old Daoist, your Dharma treasure is quite capable!”
 A cold voice came from behind Jie Yin. He turned around and saw a black shadow appear behind him, and Life’s ten thousand foot tall body was still far away.
 Jie Yin waved his staff, but the black shadow caught it with one hand.
 Boom
 The wooden staff emitted a terrifying aura that shook the power of darkness, but it couldn’t break free from the black shadow’s hand.
  The black shadow suddenly turned into a vortex, causing the wooden staff to twist and spin. Before Jie Yin could retract his hand, his right arm was torn off.
 His eyes narrowed. The wooden staff flew out of the vortex and wanted to return to his hand. However, the vortex suddenly shrank and devoured his wooden staff.
 “The power of space… He has grasped the Great Dao of Space? It shouldn’t…” Jie Yin frowned and muttered to himself, puzzled.
 On the other side, the other Great Dao Sages were also troubled by the power of darkness.
 Facing the power of darkness, they felt as if their fists were punching cotton. It was difficult to use their Mystical Powers. They were truly aggrieved.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor brought Han Tuo and kept dodging the attacks of the power of darkness. He glanced and discovered that something was wrong.
 He immediately landed in front of a palace. He held Han Tuo in one hand and used a Mystical Power with the other.
