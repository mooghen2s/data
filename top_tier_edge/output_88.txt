 Han Ye and Han Yao descended into the universe of stars in the next ten thousand years. Han Jue moved them into the third Dao Field.
 The two of them didn’t like each other, but they didn’t dare to act recklessly in front of him.
 Han Jue called Han Bashen over and gathered in the Daoist temple.
 Han Yao and Han Ye already knew Han Bashen. They nodded slightly at him and then looked at Han Ling.
 They were all proud and arrogant people and were naturally unwilling to serve her.
 Han Jue said, “You’ll enter the simulation trial first. Han Yao, Han Ye, Han Bashen, the three of you will fight Han Ling. You don’t have to serve her as long as you defeat her.”
 The three of them were stunned and looked at each other.
 Han Ye clenched his fists. “There’s no need to join forces. I alone am enough!”
 Han Jue couldn’t be bothered to say anything else. He directly pulled the four of them into the simulation trial and let them fight.
 The four of them closed their eyes.
 Not long after, Han Ye and the other two were moved. As time passed, their expressions became uglier. On the other hand, Han Ling was still calm.
 Another period of time passed.
 Han Ye, Han Yao, and Han Bashen trembled.
 The simulation ended.
 The four of them opened their eyes. Han Ye and Han Yao looked at Han Ling in disbelief. Han Bashen was already used to it and smiled helplessly.
 I still can’t run away from it.
 Han Bashen’s gaze landed on Han Jue. He would never forget the scene when he faced him.
 The terrifying seven mysterious blades of light, the pressure, the pain…
 Han Bashen was terrified just thinking about
 it.
 Han Ling smiled and asked, “Are you willing to submit to me and serve me?”
 Han Yao was silent.
 Han Ye snorted. “I admit defeat!”
 He immediately knelt down and cupped his fists. Han Yao followed helplessly, and so did Han Bashen.
 Han Jue said, “Han Ye is the Ultimate Killing Star, Han Yao is the Conquest Heavenly Star, Han Bashen is the Ultimate Gravity Star, and Han Ling’s Great Creation is the Primordial Emperor Star.”
 Primordial Emperor Star!
 Han Jue said, “No. The Primordial Fiendcelestial is your ancestor Han Huang. My Great Dao World contains countless stars. Your Great Creation is formed by me using the power of the stars.”
 The four of them looked at him in surprise. Even Han Ling was surprised.
 She had long guessed that her father could give his juniors talents. She didn’t expect it to be true.
 Han Yao and Han Ye thought deeper. So their greatest reliance was given to them by their progenitor…
 “The Killing Star, Heavenly Star, and Gravity Star will assist the Emperor Star and achieve dominance.”
 Han Jue smiled. He knew that these words would show that he was biased towards Han Ling, but so what?
 Han Yao and the other two did not feel wronged. That was how it should be.
 Han Ye asked, “Since Ancestor Han Huang is a Primordial Fiendcelestial, what do you think we can do by assisting Ancestor Han Ling?”
 Han Jue smiled and said, “Follow her and she will give you an answer sooner or later. The Primordial Fiendcelestial is only a potential and doesn’t represent the strongest.
 “Next, I will preach the Dao to you as a farewell gift.”
 He directly began to preach the Dao. The Dao voice pulled the four of them into a state of enlightenment. Even Han Ling couldn’t react in time.
 Thousands of years later.
 Han Ling and the other three left the Dao Field and began to travel the Chaos.
 Han Jue’s eyes narrowed. Figures appeared in the Daoist temple. They were all naked young men and women. They were the race he had created with the Primordial Chaos Great Creation.
 “From now on, you are the Ultimate Origin Soul Race,” Han Jue said.
 A line of words appeared in front of him as soon as he finished speaking.
 (Ultimate Origin Soul Race: Created by the Primordial Chaos Great Creation. It contains the creation of the Ultimate Origin World. It will be undying and indestructible in the Ultimate Origin World. It can control the three thousand Great Dao of the Ultimate Origin World.)
 There were currently eighteen Ultimate Origin Soul Race members. Their potential was considered top-notch in the Ultimate Origin World. They were not inferior to those Chaotic Fiendcelestials. Most importantly, they could control the three thousand Great Dao and turn the rules into their divine power.
 Han Jue began to teach them cultivation techniques.
 A thousand years later.
 He sent the Ultimate Origin Soul Race to the Ultimate Origin World. It only took him a few breaths of time to return.
 Han Jue took out the Book of Misfortune and the Heavenly Dao Spirit Stone as he sat on the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus again.
 Fusion upgrade!
 (Warning: Ultimate Supreme Treasure cannot recognize a master. Once the upgrade is successful, it will sever the restriction mark on you.]
 Han Jue hesitated.
 Forget it.
 The Book of Misfortune was too strong. He was afraid that something would happen.
 In any case, the Book of Misfortune was already useful enough.
 He should keep the Heavenly Dao Spirit Stone.
 Han Jue put it away.
 Then, he began to curse the Ninth Chaos.
 Five days later, his lifespan began to decrease. He cursed with all his might.
 Countless evil devils appeared at the bottom when the edge of the Chaos shattered again. He stopped, and the cultivation of the Ninth Chaos shook again.
 He was a little injured after 2 quadrillion years of his lifespan were deducted.
 He would cultivate in seclusion first. He had already delayed for a period of time. He would use the Creation Heaven’s Chosen in the future.
 In the mysterious domain.
 Huang Zuntian sat on an altar. Around the altar stood stone statues with strange postures that looked like humans and demons.
 A figure appeared behind Huang Zuntian and knelt down. “Life Lord, a major force has recently risen in the Chaos. They’ve three Great Dao Supremes who are extremely powerful. According to the information, two of them are among the Ten Absolute Prodigies, Han Ye and Han Yao.”
 Huang Zuntian opened his eyes and frowned. “Who’s the leader?”
 “I’m not sure. I’ve only found out a name…”
 “What’s his name?”
UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m “Emperor!”
 “Emperor?”
 Huang Zuntian tried to deduce, but it failed since he just had the name “Emperor”.
 Huang Zuntian instructed, “What’s the other party’s intention?”
 Huang Zuntian fell into deep thought.
 There were many new factions, but he had to give further thought since this matter involved Han Ye and Han Yao.
 Could it be Master’s arrangement?
 Very likely. What did Master want to do?
 Huang Zuntian said, “You can leave. Send someone to pay close attention to the Creation Emperor Court.”
 “Yes!”
 The figure vanished.
 Huang Zuntian began to cast a spell. A figure surged out of his body. It was Primordial Origin.
 Primordial Origin was only a soul body and did not reveal its face.
 Huang Zuntian asked, “How should we prepare?”
 Primordial Origin said, “Copy me and transform into a Primordial Fiendcelestial!”


 Not only did the rise of the Creation Emperor Court attract Life’s attention, but its reputation also spread to Shi Tian.
 After millions of years, the Chaos and Shi Tian had already established a preliminary fusion. The providence of the two worlds was fusing, led by the Chaos.
 The Immortal Gods gathered and discussed the Creation Emperor Court.
 “Divine General Han Yao betrayed the
 Heavenly Court. Who is this Emperor he’s assisting?”
 “The Creation Emperor Court is very
 powerful. Han Yao, Han Ye, and Han Bashen are all surnamed Han. Could the Divine Emperor really be the Divine Might Heavenly Sage?”
 “Probably not. The Divine Might Heavenly Sage is already above the Chaos. What is he doing? His two sons are both Divine Punishers.”
 “Perhaps the Divine Might Heavenly Sage’s children are gathering to dominate the Chaos? After all, they will naturally be ambitious with such a powerful backing.”
 …
 The Black General looked at the Evil Heavenly Emperor and discovered that he was smiling mysteriously.
 “Done,” the Evil Heavenly Emperor slowly said, causing the immortals in the hall to quiet down.
 Under the lead of Han Huang, Azure Heaven Mystic, Zhao Shuangquan, Han Yao, and other peerless geniuses, the current Heavenly Court had a deep foundation. Endless geniuses and many experts had already grown up. They controlled three domains of the Chaos and could be considered a transcendent force.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor said, “Don’t worry about the Creation Emperor Court. I’m good friends with the Heavenly Sage. I borrowed Han Yao from him. He contributed to the Heavenly Court and is fighting for himself now. There’s no need to blame him. If you encounter him in the Chaos in the future, you can also bow.”
 The immortals could only agree.
 An old immortal stood up and cupped his hands. “Your Majesty, we have lost contact with the Heavenly Soldiers we sent to Shi Tian. I’m afraid they’ve already encountered danger.”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor frowned. “In that case, send the five Divine Generals of the Golden Sect to lead 8,000 Saint Soldiers and find a suitable location to set up a station. Build the teleportation formation immediately.”
 With that, the five majestic golden-armored Divine Generals stood up and agreed in unison. Then, they turned around and summoned the Holy Weapons.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor began to make other arrangements, causing the entire Heavenly Court to stir.
 …
 Shi Tian.
 The void here did not look much different from the Chaos. Dao Sovereign, Zhao Xuanyuan, Jiang Yi, and Lao Dan rode the ancient tower.
 Zhao Xuanyuan sighed. “I wonder how that kid Han Ye is. I’m really not used to not
 having him around.”
 Zhao Xuanyuan glanced at him. “Although I’m romantic, I don’t want to be tied down. What about you? Do you want to rebuild the Golden Crow Divine Clan?”
 “Hmph, I’m like you.”
 “That girl from last time couldn’t bear to leave you. Why did you reject her?”
 “I have no fixed residence. Why waste her time? I can’t bring her along. Besides, she doesn’t like me. It’s just that I’m powerful.”
 “Then, you can have a romantic relationship with her. Why reject her directly? That’s a
 pity.”
 “I’m not you.”
 Lao Dan was already used to their bickering. Dao Sovereign looked ahead and said, “What do you think will happen if we gather the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority of the four worlds, Chaos, Consciousnessless,
 Transcendent, and Shi Tian?”
 Lao Dan smiled. “Don’t think about it. No one can do it. Won’t you be invincible if you really succeed? Even your master won’t be your
 match!”
 Dao Sovereign smiled. “I want to try. I’ve already intercepted the power of the Supreme
 Rules of the Transcendent and Consciousnessless worlds. Only Shi Tian is left. I wonder if there are more Great Dao
 Worlds.”
 Lao Dan shook his head. “I’m not sure. I realized that what we know is still too little and we’re too narrow-minded ever since the
 appearance of the Consciousnessless Great Dao World. If every Great Dao World represents the appearance of a supreme existence, it’s hard to imagine what the end of the path of cultivation is.”
 Dao Sovereign sighed. “Master is already so powerful, but he’s still cultivating. I think the peak of cultivation is still very far from him.
 To us,
 it’s even more so.”
 Lao Dan nodded.
 “No matter what, I must obtain the power of Shi Tian’s Supreme Rules. As usual, old man, formulate a battle plan. Zhao Xuanyuan and
 Jiang Yi will help me block the intruders. I’ll teach it to you when I successfully intercept
 it!”
 Dao Sovereign instructed. He could not refuse. From the beginning to the end, he had always been the leader of this team. Even Lao Dan had to listen to him.
 Zhao Xuanyuan scratched his head and said helplessly, “I hope that Shi Tian’s cultivators won’t disappoint me. It’s been a long time since I fought to my heart’s content. I already feel the loneliness of invincibility.”
 Jiang Yi crossed his arms and curled his lips. “How shameless.”
 Although he said that, his eyes revealed anticipation.
 It was already very difficult for them to encounter opponents in the Chaos! Perhaps there was a mighty figure stronger than them, but he was not their match.
 Time passed quickly. The situation in the Chaos changed. New people rose and ruled the world. There were also older mighty figures
 who died and even overlords. It could be said to be extremely lively.
 To warlike people, this was an unprecedented golden age. As long as they were powerful enough, they could leave their names in history and shock the world.
 To Han Jue, as usual, he entered seclusion for another five million years.
 Han Jue opened his eyes, looking satisfied. He could cultivate at will after the Ultimate Origin World landed in the blank domain. His cultivation speed returned to before.
 Apart from the development of the Ultimate Origin World that could increase his cultivation, he could also refine his Dharmic powers and transform them into Ultimate Origin Power.
 Apart from him, when other living beings reached the perfected Great Dao Supreme
 Realm, they could no longer rely on meditation to increase their cultivation. It was the same even for Dao Creators. They could only rely on the Great Dao World.
 The stronger the foundation of the Great Dao World, the stronger its master could absorb the power of the Great Dao World. Of course, this was not a one-sided absorption, but
 Han Jue started to check his emails.
 Han Ling, Han Ye, Han Yao, and Han Bashen had been extremely active in the past five million years. Han Ling had established the
 Creation Emperor Court and had illustrious providence.
 Dao Sovereign and the other three entered Shi Tian and caused another huge number of attacks. The four of them were even
 suppressed by a mysterious mighty figure and were severely injured.
 Han Jue was very assured about the four of them. They wouldn’t die.
 The higher one’s cultivation level was, the more one cherished their life. The personal
 win.
 disciples would definitely use the Invocation Technique if they really couldn’t More than half of his friends entered Shi Tian, making Han Jue look forward to it.
 After reading the emails, Han Jue stood up and walked out of the Daoist temple to reminisce with the good people.
 He only returned to the Daoist temple after hundreds of years.
 He was about to enter seclusion when he suddenly felt something and was slightly
 moved.
 Someone was borrowing his Ultimate Origin
 Power!
 Han Huang!
 Ultimate Rage Tyrant Star!
 Ever since this opportunity landed on Han Huang, this was the first time he borrowed Han Jue’s power. After all, his strength was
 already top-notch in the Chaos. No one could force him to this extent.
 Han Huang stayed in Shi Tian during this
 period of time.
 There was such an expert in Shi Tian?


 Shi Tian, on a desolate continent covered in blood.
 The ground shattered and the sky tore apart. Space-time cracks were like countless huge centipedes that occupied it, looking sinister and terrifying
 A ten-million-feet-tall mighty figure stood on the ground. His body was surrounded by dragon-like nebulous Primordial Qi. His long hair fluttered wildly and his figure was burly. His armor was stretched until cracks appeared.
 It was Han Huang.
 He had already used the Primordial Fiendcelestial’s main body. His aura was like a rainbow as he looked down at the terrifying figures in the distance.
 Ten Great Dao Supremes and more than a hundred Great Dao Sages were scattered in all directions, trapping Han Huang here. This continent had already been set up with an array formation to isolate the void.
 “Han Huang, today is the day you die!”
 “Eternal Peak of the Chaos? It’s indeed impressive. Unfortunately, you will die here!”
 “Why are you talking nonsense with him? If the Mystic Ancestor makes a move, we have to hurry up!” “Hahaha, killing Han Huang is equivalent to cutting off an arm of the Chaos!”
 He was extremely excited as he sensed the endless mysterious power in his body.
 “So this is the power of the Primordial Fiendcelestial! With this power, I’m invincible!”
 Han Huang roared in his heart, his eyes filled with killing intent.
 He slowly raised his right hand and a purple blade of light appeared in front of him. It was Han Jue’s Ultimate Origin Soul Oblivion, but the color was different.
 Han Huang smiled disdainfully. “You thieves, I’ll let you see the power of the Primordial Fiendcelestial!”
 Primordial Fiendcelestial!
 Impossible!
 Han Huang laughed wantonly and suddenly waved his hand. Purple Ultimate Origin Soul Oblivion shot out and swept through the hundred Great Dao Sages in the sky.
 The Great Dao Sages attacked one after another, while the Great Dao Supremes attacked Han Huang.
 Han Huang was fearless and extremely excited. Dharma Idols condensed on his body as he lept. He waved his palm in all directions and kept using the Divine Might Great Heaven Palm.
 Boom! Boom! Boom…
 The world collapsed. The River of Destiny hidden in the sky appeared and twisted wantonly, ready to be destroyed at any time.
 Han Huang grabbed a Great Dao Sage and crushed the Great Dao runes around him, crushing his body into dust. Such was his power.
 Swish!
 A huge black sword suddenly stabbed into Han Huang’s back. Endless lightning burst out and interwove around him, destroying him crazily. Even his soul was injured.
 Han Huang frowned and turned around. A Ghost Head Daoist was casting a spell in the sky. Behind him was a netherworld-like scene of hell.
 Han Huang’s killing intent erupted. His eyes narrowed as the Ultimate Origin Soul Oblivion condensed again and charged in front of Daoist Ghost Head. Before he could react, he was obliterated by the Ultimate Origin Soul. Even his body and soul were destroyed.
 The battle did not stop because of this. The other mighty figures kept attacking.
 A Great Dao Supreme held a long sword and slashed a crack in the sky. A flowing river appeared in the crack. It was billions of kilometers wide, as if the sky was collapsing.
 Han Huang looked up and felt several Great Dao auras.
 “Great Dao River? Interesting!”
 Han Huang thought of the Mystical Power that Dao Sovereign had used in the Chaotic Assembly.
 At this moment, a terrifying figure suddenly rose from the Great Dao River. Only his upper body was revealed. He wore broken ancient bronze armor and had four arms. His face was like dead wood. Only his eyes were empty and lonely. There were countless divine weapons above his head, like an ancient god who had revived from the ancient battlefield.
 “Primordial Fiendcelestial? I’ll let you experience the power of the oldest Chaotic Fiendcelestial first!”
 The Great Dao Supreme stood above the Great Dao River and laughed wantonly.
 “Remember his name, Ancient Ultimate God!”
 With that said, the Ancient Ultimate God struggled out of the Great Dao River and swooped down at Han Huang.
 Han Huang was about to resist when a mysterious and powerful force suddenly bound him, preventing him from moving.
 Crap!
 Han Huang was moved.
 Boom
 The ground shattered and dust flew. The barrier in the sky shattered and the endless dark void devoured everything.
 On the other side.
 In the third Dao Field.
 Han Jue was watching the battle with relish.
 The strongest was that Mystic Ancestor, right? He imprisoned Han Huang in the void, causing him to be suppressed by the Ancient Ultimate God.
 The Mystic Ancestor was very strong, even stronger than Laozi. The Ultimate God of Punishment was probably not his match one-on-one.
 “However, it’s not so easy to kill my son.”
 Han Jue smiled and began to increase the Ultimate Origin Power he sent to Han Huang.
 Lil’ brat!
 I want to see how much you can withstand!
 Boom
 In the abyss-like battlefield.
 The violent Ultimate Origin Power dispersed the dust storm that covered the sky and pushed the majestic Ancient Ultimate God into the void.
 “Nonsense. It’s nothing much even if you join forces!”
 Two waves of Ultimate Origin Soul Oblivion appeared around Han Huang and stepped on the Ancient Ultimate God with endless divine might.
 The Great Dao Supreme who had summoned the Great Dao River said angrily, “Don’t be arrogant!”
 The Great Dao River quickly flowed and surrounded Han Huang. Ancient Ultimate Gods crawled out of the river like demons breaking free from their cages.
 “Enough!”
 A dignified voice descended. A white-robed Daoist sitting on a green lotus throne slowly landed. Resplendent divine light lit up behind him, illuminating the void.
 Han Huang frowned. It was this fellow again!
 If not for the Mystic Ancestor, these dogs wouldn’t be his match at all!
 He could sense that the Mystic Ancestor had grasped the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority. He could be said to still remember
 it.
 The Master of the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority in front of him was the strongest existence he had ever encountered.
 Mystic Ancestor had a benevolent expression. His eyes were closed and his skin was as white as jade. He was like a statue.
 “Leave your power behind and I can let you live.”
 The Mystic Ancestor’s voice was extremely dignified and irrefutable.
 Han Huang couldn’t be bothered to talk nonsense with him. He controlled the two streams of Ultimate Origin Soul Oblivion to attack.
 How fast was the Ultimate Origin Soul Oblivion? Before the afterimage disappeared, it had already arrived on both sides of the Mystic Ancestor, wanting to crush him.
 However, the Ultimate Origin Soul passed through the Mystic Ancestor’s body harmlessly. He was not injured at all.
 Han Huang frowned. Could it be that this was not his main body?
 The Mystic Ancestor said, “No power in this world can hurt me, even if it’s the Supreme Rules…”
 Cracks suddenly appeared on his body before he could finish speaking, causing him to open his eyes.
 “Impossible…
 “What power is this?”
 Mystic Ancestor was moved and immediately suppressed the remaining Ultimate Origin Power coursing through his body.


 He raised his hands, and two Ultimate Origin Soul Oblivion condensed in his palms again. He attacked the Mystic Ancestor at an extremely fast speed.
 “You’re courting death!” A Great Dao Supreme saw that something was wrong with the Mystic Ancestor and immediately stopped him.
 Han Huang waved the Ultimate Origin Soul Oblivion and slashed. The Great Dao Supreme took out an ancient lamp. The ancient lamp emitted a strong light, but it was directly shattered by the Ultimate Origin Soul Oblivion!
 “How can this be?!”
 The Great Dao Supreme’s expression changed drastically. Before he could dodge, Han Huang’s other Ultimate Origin Soul Oblivion slashed over, destroying his body and soul.
 Han Huang followed in front of the Mystic Ancestor. Two Ultimate Origin Soul Oblivion slashed at him.
 Mystic Ancestor immediately dodged, causing Han Huang to miss.
 At this moment, Ancient Ultimate Gods flew out from the Great Dao River and drowned Han Huang like an army of locusts.
 Divine light burst out and flickered. Ancient Ultimate Gods were forcefully killed by Han Huang.
 W
 The Great Dao Supreme who controlled the Great Dao River gritted his teeth and kept casting spells to summon more Ancient Ultimate Gods from the Great Dao River.
 As the number of Ancient Ultimate Gods increased, this Great Dao Supreme’s body shriveled at a speed visible to the naked eye, as if his blood Qi had been sucked dry.
 Soon, his skin turned to dust like paper, leaving only a skeleton. He was no longer able to summon the Ancient Ultimate God, and the Ancient Ultimate Gods previously summoned had already been killed by Han Huang.
 The Ancient Ultimate God was indeed very strong. That pressure was enough to crush ordinary Great Dao Supremes, but he was like a mortal and could not withstand a single blow in front of the Ultimate Origin Power.
 Han Huang arrived in front of the Mystic Ancestor again and smiled sinisterly. “I thought you were strong. Why are you running away like a rat?”
 Mystic Ancestor was still infuriated no matter how good-tempered he was. He said coldly, “Junior, you’re too arrogant!”
 Boom
 In the light, Han Huang crossed the two Ultimate Origin Souls in front of him and easily blocked this light, causing a hollow area to appear in the middle of the light.
 “Too powerful!”
 Han Huang thought with fascination. He was referring to the power in his hand and not the Mystic Ancestor’s power.
 He felt that he was omnipotent as he held the Ultimate Origin Soul Oblivion.
 No matter how powerful an existence was, it was nothing in front of him!
 He laughed wantonly in excitement and approached the Mystic Ancestor again.
 Great Dao Sages flew over from all directions wanting to stop him. In the end, they were swept away by the Ultimate Origin Soul Oblivion. They were all reduced to ashes when they touched it.
 Han Jue was speechless.
 My Ultimate Origin Soul Oblivion is being used by this brat like this. It’s too uncouth.
 But it made sense on second thought.
 His Ultimate Origin Soul Oblivion could automatically kill enemies, but to Han Huang, it was an external force and could not be used freely.
 From the battle situation, Han Huang was definitely going to win.
 Unless the Immeasurable Destruction Venerable personally took action.
 This battle shouldn’t alarm the Immeasurable Destruction Venerable. Although Han Huang could win, those Great Dao Sages all had life-saving methods. It was impossible for them to fight with their main bodies. Even if they did, soul fragments would definitely be reborn.
 It was very difficult to truly kill a Great Dao Sage.
 Most of the time, he had to use a Karma Mystical Power to destroy it.
 Although the Book of Misfortune was not affected by karma, it was essentially a karma attack. However, its karma was high-level and surpassed ordinary karma.
 Han Jue naturally wouldn’t use the Book of Misfortune to curse Han Huang’s enemies to death.
 In this life, everyone had their own methods. If they lost, they had to be able to afford it.
 Han Huang had countless mortal enemies along the way. How could Han Jue curse them all to death?
 Even his son was like this, let alone his other children and personal disciples.
 Han Jue was in a good mood and thought of the Creation Heaven’s Chosen he had accumulated.
 Should he use it?
 It just so happened that he didn’t have anyone by his side.
 Han Jue couldn’t help but smile.
 (Activating the Creation Heaven’s Chosen. A random Great Creation will appear among your descendants.]
 (Your descendant Shan’e has awakened an Innate Great Creation-Curse Origin Star]
 [Curse Origin Star: Ultimate Origin Great Creation. Because you cursed many times, it left a mark in the depths of your soul and subsequently affected the Ultimate Origin World, producing the Dao of Curses and forming the Creation Star Phase. This creation can give curse talent that does not involve karma.]
 Han Jue was stunned.
 This was… a humanoid Book of Misfortune?
 Goodness.
 You can do that?
 Han Jue was interested in Shan’e. He had to control this kid well to prevent him from being treated as the Dark Forbidden Lord.
 He began to deduce Shan’e.
 No wonder this fellow’s surname was not Han. He wasn’t born into the Han family but into a great world of Shi Tian.
 The Heavenly Dao had also been investigating Shi Tian for millions of years. A portion of the Han family disciples had been sent out. When Shi Tian was adventuring, some died and some disappeared. Shan’e was the child left behind by the missing.
 Shan’e’s ancestor was surnamed Han. He was saved by a woman from Shi Tian when he was severely injured and had children with her.
 However, Shan’e’s parents died at the hands of the Chaotic Cultivators.
 The Chaos and the Heavenly Dao plundered each other. The world where Shan’e was located was slaughtered by the Chaotic Cultivator. Only a few people survived, including Shan’e.
 Before obtaining the Curse Origin Star, Shan’e was hiding in a ruin to survive. He was only sixteen years old now.
 He had lived alone for ten years.
 Han Jue sighed.
 Another unfortunate descendant.
 He did not move immediately. Instead, he waited for the transformation to end.
 Shan’e awakened the Curse Origin Star. At this moment, he was wrapped by the curse power like a black egg.
 Several months later.
 Shan’e finally awakened. During this period of time, his body instinctively absorbed the Spirit Qi of Heaven and Earth and became stronger.
 In the ruins.
 Shan’e’s clothes were tattered. His hair was messy and his face was dirty and covered in sweat. He looked at his hands in surprise.
 “This power… That’s right… It really exists… Could this be the Dharmic powers of a cultivator?”
 Shan’e was overjoyed. He would never forget the calamity back then. He had always wanted revenge, but it was difficult for him to even survive because he didn’t have a cultivation technique.
 “Sure! I’m finally qualified to take revenge!” Shan’e clenched his fists and muttered to himself.
 At this moment, the scene in front of him suddenly changed.
 A man appeared in front of him.
 He was stunned.
 He had never seen such a handsome man. It was indescribable.
 After being stunned for a moment, he suddenly retreated and looked around in horror.
 It was a Daoist temple with its door closed.
 To be able to suddenly bring him here, the other party must be a cultivator.
 Shan’e was extremely hostile to cultivators, but because he was too weak, this hostility turned into nervousness and fear.
 Han Jue smiled warmly. “Don’t be afraid. I won’t hurt you.”
 Shan’e swallowed and asked carefully, “What are you doing?”
 Han Jue said, “Cultivate beside me in the future.”
 Shan’e widened his eyes.
 Immortal?
 Could it be because of the power he had awakened earlier?
 That must be it!
 There was no free lunch in the world!
 Shan’e was silent. He began to think about how to escape.
 Han Jue smiled. “With your current strength, you will need about 7 octodecillion years to return to where you came from. Moreover, this prerequisite applies only after you learn how to fly.”


UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m 7 octodecillion years?
 Shan’e was stunned. He couldn’t imagine what this number meant.
 He asked carefully, “Who are you? Why did you capture me?”.
 Han Jue smiled. “Me? I’m your ancestor. I took you in because I saw that you were pitiful.”
 Ancestor!
 Shan’e hurriedly knelt down and kowtowed.
 Han Jue said, “Your ancestor is from the Han family of the Heavenly Dao. The Chaos and Shi Tian have fused ten million years ago…”
 He told Shan’e about his ancestry. Hatred flashed across Shan’e’s eyes when he heard about the Chaos, but the long timeline shocked him.
 It turned out that his ancestor and his hated enemy actually came from the same place. In a sense, it was a misunderstanding. His heart collapsed.
 Why was this happening?
 He felt that fate was teasing him!
 Han Jue said, “This is the karma of the world. Anyone will face calamity in their life. Cultivate beside me in peace in the future and let go of your hatred.”
 Shan’e looked up and gritted his teeth. “Impossible! I must take revenge. I don’t care about my ancestry. I only know that that person killed my parents. I must kill him one day!”
 Han Jue smiled and continued, “Cultivate beside me. Every time I enter seclusion, it will take five million years. After five million years, that person will probably be long dead. Even if you rush back now and look for him, you won’t be able to catch up to his lifespan limit.”
 Shan’e was stunned.
 Erm…
 Although he felt that it was ridiculous, what the ancestor said was the truth.
 At such a distance and at such a time, revenge became pale and meaningless.
 But he was indignant!
 Han Jue waved his sleeve and cast a spell to cleanse Shan’e’s body. Then, he changed into a clean Daoist robe.
 As expected of his descendants, they were all very handsome.
 Han Jue created a mat beside him and gestured for Shan’e to sit down.
 He began to teach this kid the cultivation technique.
 As Han Jue cultivated in seclusion, he multitasked and guided Shan’e from time to time.
 Year after year passed. Shan’e originally thought that Han Jue was scaring him, but slowly, he felt that it was true.
 He felt lonely after cultivating for decades. He wanted to go out, but he discovered that he couldn’t open the door of the Daoist temple no matter what he did, much less use spells to break out.
 He had no choice but to continue cultivating.
 He tried again thousands of years later, using his Mystical Power, but he crashed into the wall.
 Just like that, Shan’e began to cultivate to escape. He gradually forgot his hatred.
 Time could erase everything. When there was no hope and things were not going well, they could only remember hatred. However, if they lived a positive life and had a bright future, the weight of hatred would decrease greatly. Of course, they still had to take revenge if they succeeded in the future.
 Shan’e’s temperament was also constantly transforming. He was not as cold as before.
 Time passed quickly.
 Nearly five million years passed in the blink of an eye.
 Han Jue woke up and notifications appeared in front of him.
 [Detected that you are 80 million years old and your life has taken another step forward. You have the following choices:]
 (1: Exit seclusion immediately and destroy the other Great Dao Worlds. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment, a Primordial Fragment, a Creation Spirit Stone, and a chance to upgrade the system function.]
 [2: Cultivate in a low-profile manner and maintain your original intention. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment, a Primordial Fragment, and a Creation Spirit Stone.]
 [You have obtained a Creation Heaven’s Chosen attempt.]
 He definitely couldn’t choose the first option. That would attract too much hatred.
 Han Jue silently chose the second option.
 (You chose to cultivate in a low-profile manner and obtained a Great Dao Fragment, a Primordial Fragment, and a Creation Spirit Stone.)
 The Creation Heaven’s Chosen was activated when he was ten million years old. He obtained a chance every ten million years. Currently, the descendants who obtained the Creation Heaven’s Chosen were Han Huang, Han Ling, Han Yao, Han Ye, Han Bashen, and Shan’e. He had eight attempts at 80 million years old. There were still two slots left.
 At this age, Han Jue was not only at the Freedom Realm.
 Han Jue decided to keep the Creation Heaven’s Chosen for now and draw ten consecutive times in the future.
 When his descendants thought that they were already independent and didn’t need Han Jue, he would use the Creation Heaven’s Chosen and use a new batch of Creation descendants to stimulate them.
 Han Jue stood up, causing Shan’e to wake up.
 He felt as if a lifetime had passed as he saw Han Jue stand up.
 A million years ago, he was impatient and uneasy. Later, he got used to it and became immersed in cultivation, unable to extricate himself.
 It was as if he had a long dream.
 Han Jue brought him out of the Daoist temple to see the others. Shan’e was even more stunned when he saw the situation of the Dao Field.
 It was more beautiful than he had imagined. It was like paradise, as beautiful as a painting.
 “Wow, another descendant. He’s quite shy!” Xing Hongxuan said in surprise. Then, she pinched Shan’e’s face, scaring him so much that he hurriedly retreated.
 Qingluan’er and Xuan Qingjun also sized him up with interest.  Han Jue smiled, “These are all your grandmothers. Don’t be afraid. You have to treat them like mothers in the future, understand? I’ll deal with you if you’re rude.”
 Shan’e’s nervousness vanished.
 Although he had interacted with Han Jue for five million years, he had never understood his personality. It was filled with distance. Now, Han Jue’s threat made him feel that he was human.
 After that, Han Jue brought Shan’e to the second Dao Field to see the other personal disciples.
 Han Jue left a clone in the second Dao Field. If any disciple wanted to go out, they could report to the clone at any time. Currently, half of the disciples in the second Dao Field were still here.
 The Black Hell Chicken shouted when it saw Shan’e, “Master has another son!”
 The others gathered.
 Han Jue said angrily, “It’s not a son, but a descendant.”
 He briefly introduced Shan’e. The disciples felt pity for him after learning about his background.
 “Who killed your parents? Pass me his voice and appearance. I’ll get the Hidden Sect disciples to put him on the wanted list,” Murong Qi asked.
 Shan’e couldn’t help but look at Han Jue.
 Han Jue said, “That person has already died. He slaughtered another world of Shi Tian three million years ago. He was attacked by a mighty figure and died. He didn’t even have a chance to enter the cycle of reincarnation.”
 Everyone was silent.
 This was the first time Shan’e had heard this news. He frowned.
 Several days later.
 Han Jue brought Shan’e to his territory. It could be considered telling the personal disciples that if they encountered Shan’e in the future, they had to take care of him.
 The personal disciples were no longer the same as before. They naturally understood the meaning of Han Jue’s actions.
 Back in the Daoist temple.
 Shan’e remained silent.
 Han Jue said, “The power awakened in your body before I moved you into the Daoist temple was given by me. You’re not the only one. Previously, I also chose other six descendants. Some of them were even worse off than you, but they have already walked out of the shadow of hatred and started living for themselves.”
