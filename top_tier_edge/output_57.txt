 Primordial Vengeful Spirit…
 Han Jue narrowed his eyes and fell into deep thought.
 He was not afraid. In any case, the Ultimate God of Punishment had already said that these Primordial Vengeful Spirits could not threaten him, so they were even less his
 match.
 However, existence represented a possibility that could not be ignored.
 Han Jue asked, “There’s no way to eliminate the Primordial Vengeful Spirits under the Chaos forever?”
 The Ultimate God of Punishment shook his head. “I’m also looking. Not for the time being.”
 His tone changed as he said, “I plan to set up a Chaotic Assembly, and I want to join forces with you. With your reputation and my authority, I will attract the Chaotic geniuses to participate. I will provide all sorts of opportunities to reward the outstanding geniuses in the meeting.
 “I’ll set this event as three stages.
  “The first round is below the Chaos. It’s ranked by killing the Primordial Vengeful Spirits.
 Han Jue felt that this was a good thing. At least, this could promote the development of the prodigies.
 Those mighty figures would definitely use all means to nurture geniuses in order to obtain these generous rewards.
 Han Jue asked, “What’s the threshold? What’s the deadline?”
 The Ultimate God of Punishment smiled. “Anyone with a lifespan below a hundred million years can participate. It will be held once every ten million years. How about that?”
 Han Jue narrowed his eyes. “A hundred Great Dao Divine Spirits will appear every hundred million years?”
 He felt that it was a little fast!
 Han Jue was impressed.
 It had to be said that this fellow was indeed ambitious and dared to do it.
 Han Jue shook his head. “Forget it, I won’t participate. I can watch the battle.”
 It was fine as long as it was not the main body.
 The Ultimate God of Punishment laughed. “I’m just saying. Who dares to fight for the Eternal Peak of the Chaos after hearing that you’re participating?”
 Han Jue narrowed his eyes and asked, “Do you think there are stronger existences above us?”
 The Ultimate God of Punishment was silent.
 Seeing this, Han Jue knew that he had already sensed it.
 “So, I’m not the only one who feels this way. In the past, I thought that the Primordial Ancestor God was the strongest, but I kept feeling uneasy after he died. The Supreme Rules are so powerful. What are we in front of them?” The Ultimate God of Punishment sighed.
 He stepped forward and recounted his encounter.
 Han Jue’s question pulled the relationship between the two sides closer.
 They chatted for an hour before ending the dream.
 Han Jue also obtained a favorable impression of the Ultimate God of Punishment, but it was not high, only 3 stars.
 His will returned to his body. Han Qing’er was still arguing with him, wanting to travel to the Immortal World.
 Han Jue said, “I’ll let you out when you reach the Pseudo-Sage Realm. Before that, I’ll teach you some Mystical Powers.”
 A Pseudo-Sage was the ceiling in the Immortal World. Han Qing’er wouldn’t encounter danger with this cultivation.
 Han Qing’er’s face fell. From a Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal to a Pseudo-Sage, she had to cultivate for at least ten thousand years.
 This lecture lasted for a hundred years.
 She opened her eyes. Her eyes were a little unfocused, but they quickly became clear and firm.
 She said in surprise, “Father, your Mystical Powers are so powerful!”
 Many Mystical Powers appeared in her mind. Not only that, but her cultivation level also increased greatly.
 This girl had always been so rude in the past, but she was respectful to him today.
 Now you know how powerful I am!
 “Are you confident in cultivating to the Pseudo-Sage Realm?” Han Jue asked.
 Han Qing’er nodded and left like a gust of wind.
 Han Jue smiled in satisfaction. This was more like his daughter. She had to have a desire to be strong even if she was a woman.
 He checked the emails to see what was going on in his circle of friends.
 It had been a long time since he had read the emails.
 (Your disciple Dao Sovereign was attacked by an Inauspicious Evil) x69093682
 [Your disciple Zhao Xuanyuan…)
 (Your good friend Yi Tian was attacked by the Great Dao Divine Punisher] x3
 (Your good friend Foolish Sword Sage was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure.]
 Dao Sovereign, Zhao Xuanyuan, Jiang Yi, and Lao Dan were still being beaten.
 Huang Zuntian’s opportunity was within Han Jue’s expectations. This kid would soar sooner or later.
 Blood essence transformed into descendants?
 What was he doing?
 Han Jue pinched his fingers to deduce.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor actually created 20,000 descendants and allowed them to control the world that the Heavenly Court had attacked. It felt like he was conferring the title of vassal king.
 Unknowingly, the Evil Heavenly Emperor had already reached the perfected Freedom Sage Realm.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor seemed not far from attaining the Dao.
 Han Jue continued reading the emails with relish.
 Five minutes later, he entered his cultivation state again.
 Han Qing’er’s cultivation improved by leaps and bounds while Han Jue was in seclusion.
 Fifty thousand years later.
 Han Qing’er finally stepped into the Pseudo-Sage Realm.
 She discovered that this was not the Heavenly Dao at all. There was no sign of the Immortal World inside or outside the universe, let alone the myriad worlds below the Immortal World.
 At this moment.
 She suddenly discovered that there were two other people in this universe.
 They were Liu Bei and Jiang Jueshi.
 Jiang Jueshi couldn’t hide his figure and aura after being attacked by the Inauspicious Evil. It was to scare away the experts who wanted to invade the universe.
 “Who?”
 Jiang Jueshi’s cold shout entered Han Qing’er’s ears, scaring her so much that her guts almost ruptured and her soul trembled. Han Qing’er’s beautiful eyes widened in disbelief.
 Who was the other party?
 Just the other party’s voice caused her to feel an unprecedented fear.


 Han Qing’er retracted her divine sense in fear. She was so nervous that her body stiffened.
 She felt like she was in trouble. Would it attract trouble?
 She recalled what she had seen in the Immortal World. A cultivator had said that sometimes, a divine sense would attract death if it accidentally provoked a mighty figure.
 She recalled the terrifying feeling just now and became more and more afraid. She hesitated for a moment but still decided to find Han Jue.
 She entered the Daoist temple and called out carefully, “Father…”
 Han Qing’er stopped in front of Han Jue, but he ignored her, making her even more anxious.
 On the other side.
 In a star.
 Jiang Jueshi asked in surprise, “Why does this universe have divine sense? Furthermore, I can’t even deduce where it is?”
 Jiang Jueshi’s expression changed drastically.
 Liu Bei hurriedly said, “You don’t have to worry. The mighty figure who created this universe is an ascetic. He has surpassed the Great Dao Sage Realm and is a supreme existence in the Chaos. He has already handed the universe to me. I’m the master of this universe.”
 Jiang Jueshi’s expression softened. “What’s this mighty figure’s name?”
 Liu Bei shook his head. “I can’t say, I can’t
 say.”
 Jiang Jueshi frowned. “Then, my arrival…”
 Jiang Jueshi was flattered.
 He had been here for so long and had not sensed the other party’s existence. He naturally would not question the other party’s cultivation.
 S were
 The mighty figures in the Chaos were immeasurable.
 Since this mighty figure admired him, why not stay and rely on him in the future?
 No matter where he was, he had to have a backing. Otherwise, he could only be a rat running around.
 Forget it.
 The coldness on Jiang Jueshi’s face dissipated. He sighed and continued cultivating.
 Liu Bei knew that he had let down his guard, so he smiled and did not say anything else.
 It wasn’t good to say too much. Everything depended on time.
 He believed that Jiang Jueshi knew what to do.
 He had a clear conscience.
 In the third Dao Field.
 Han Qing’er stayed for an hour before leaving, no longer disturbing Han Jue’s cultivation.
 She returned to the tree.
 Qingluan’er opened her eyes and asked, “Why are you in a hurry to find your father? Didn’t I say not to disturb his cultivation?”
 Han Qing’er curled her lips and hesitated for a moment, but she still told her what had happened. She was afraid that hiding this matter would cause a calamity.
 Qingluan’er couldn’t help but laugh.
 Han Qing’er was furious. “Mother, what are you laughing at! Do you think I’m lying to
 you?”
 Qingluan’er shook her head. “No, I believe you. However, the cultivators in this universe are not enemies. They’re actually your father’s disciples.”
 “Huh?”
 Qingluan’er was stunned.
 Disciples?
 She was dumbfounded.
 How terrifying was Jiang Jueshi’s voice? She even thought that her father might not be his match. She didn’t expect him to be her father’s disciple?
 She hurriedly asked, “Mother, why didn’t Father bring them in? He didn’t mention them, either?”
 “Your father has many disciples. Aren’t you uninterested in his story? He has told you many things since you were young, but you always avoid him and argue alone. Blame yourself if you want to blame someone.”
 Qingluan’er shook her head with a mocking expression.
 Han Qing’er thought about it carefully and agreed.
 She became interested in Jiang Jueshi and started to ask about him.
 Qingluan’er did not hide anything.
 The current Han Qing’er was already a Pseudo-Sage. She should know the higher realms.
 Han Qing’er was stunned after she finished speaking
 New novels chapters are published ᴏn !
 Freedom Sage…
 Two realms higher than her!
 It was a major realm!
 No wonder she was so afraid.
 Han Qing’er asked excitedly, “Is he the most powerful disciple under Father?”
 This time, Qingluan’er was in a dilemma.
 She really did not know.
 “I only know that this Jiang Jueshi doesn’t know of your father’s existence. I believe that your father has other disciples. Back then, there were countless disciples in the Hundred Peak Immortal River when we went to see your aunt.” Qingluan’er sighed.
 Speaking of which, she didn’t know Han Jue very well. Han Jue was also mysterious to her.
 However, he was still her husband no matter how mysterious he was.
 Han Jue had been unfathomable from the first time they met. She was already used to it.
 Han Qing’er continued to ask like a curious baby.
 Time passed.
 Year after year passed.
 Another hundred thousand years passed.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and frowned.
 Then, he smiled in satisfaction.
 He was about to break through after another seclusion cycle.
 He sent a voice transmission to Han Qing’er.
 She quickly arrived.
 Her cultivation level had already reached the late-stage Pseudo-Sage Realm and was already close to the Primordial Chaos Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm.
 “Father! Father!” Han Qing’er called out excitedly. She went to Han Jue’s side and started to rub his shoulders with a fawning smile.
 Han Jue said, “You want to return to the Immortal World?”
 “Can I?” Han Qing’er asked carefully.
 Han Jue stood up and smiled. “Of course. I’ll bring you there today.”
 “Really?”
 “Yes, go say goodbye to your mother. I don’t know when you’ll return.”
 “Alright!”
 Han Qing’er turned around and left.
 Qingluan’er was with her when she returned.
 Han Qing’er said helplessly, “Mother, I’m already two hundred thousand years old. Don’t always treat me like a child. You followed my father when you were twenty. How can you trap me?” Qingluan’er choked, not knowing how to persuade her.
 Han Jue said, “That’s all. My children and grandchildren will take care of themselves.”
 “Thank you, Father!”
 Han Qing’er was extremely excited.
 Han Jue teleported away with her.
 Qingluan’er felt desolate as she looked at the empty Daoist temple.
 She suddenly understood how her parents felt when they saw her leave.
 In the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 Han Jue and Han Qing’er appeared and came to the 33rd Heaven.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du sent a voice transmission to the will left in the Hundred Peak Immortal River several years ago, inviting him to the Universal Hall.
 The father and daughter arrived in front of the Universal Hall.
 Han Qing’er asked, “Why are we here? Do you want to see Little Yu?”
  Han Jue didn’t say anything and walked towards the door. It opened, and Han Qing’er hurriedly followed him inside.
 The father and daughter came in front of Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du after entering the hall.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du stood up and bowed. Then, he sent a voice transmission to the Sages.
 He looked at Han Qing’er and sighed. “The Heavenly Sage’s daughter is indeed extraordinary. She’s already a Pseudo-Sage.”
 Han Jue and Han Qing’er looked similar, and their auras were also similar.
 “This is my daughter, Han Qing’er. Greet Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du.”
 Han Jue introduced them briefly. Hearing this, Han Qing’er hurriedly bowed.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du?
 The leader of the Heavenly Dao Sages?
 Han Qing’er was shocked. She had heard of the legends of Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du and the Divine Might Heavenly Sage when she traveled the Immortal World two hundred thousand years ago.
 Heavenly Sage’s daughter…


 While Han Qing’er was shocked and curious, Han Jue and Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du sat down side by side.
 Han Jue waved at her, signaling her to stand behind him.
 One Sage after another arrived. Every Sage had to bow to Han Jue and Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du after they entered the hall. Han Qing’er was secretly surprised.
 She was already a Pseudo-Sage, but she couldn’t see through their cultivation levels. What were they if they were not Sages?
 All the Sages arrived not long after. Even the Foolish Sword Sage, Great Sage Void Soul, and Red Fate came.
 It was rare to see Han Jue, so they naturally wouldn’t miss it.
 The Foolish Sword Sage stared at Han Jue with flickering eyes.
 He wanted to challenge him, but he was still not confident when he saw him again.
 The Sages noticed Han Qing’er behind Han Jue and guessed.
  Han Qing’er was immediately happy when she saw Han Yu. She winked at him, making Han Yu feel quite embarrassed.
 Long Hao asked curiously, “Master, who is this behind you?”
 Master?
 ......
 Han Qing’er’s eyes lit up as she sized him up.
 Was this also her father’s disciple?
 The Sages praised Han Qing’er’s talent.
 This was the first time the new Sages saw Han Jue. They were already in awe. They couldn’t help but sigh when they heard that the potential of the Heavenly Sage’s daughter was so terrifying.
 Achieving the Pseudo-Sage Realm at 200,000 years old was also a top genius in the entire Immortal World.
 For a time, the Sages became active.
 Wouldn’t their relationship with the Divine Might Heavenly Sage improve if they could take Han Qing’er as their disciple?
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du looked around and said, “I called you here today for a huge matter, a huge matter that can affect the entire Chaos. This is also an opportunity for the Heavenly Dao.”
 Indeed, they were all Heavenly Dao Sages!
 Then, was her father the legendary Divine Might Heavenly Sage who had repeatedly protected the Heavenly Dao?
 Han Qing’er was so excited that she felt unreal.
 She often heard legends about the Divine Might Heavenly Sage when she traveled the Immortal World in the past.
 Divine Might guarded the Heavenly Dao and Xuan Du ruled all living beings!
 This sentence spread the most!
 It was enough to prove the Divine Might Heavenly Sage’s importance and status to the Heavenly Dao!
 It was very difficult for Han Qing’er to associate the Divine Might Heavenly Sage with her father.
 The legendary Divine Might Heavenly Sage was peerlessly powerful and domineering. He looked down on all the mighty forces in the Chaos. How majestic was that?
 Han Qing’er couldn’t help but look at Han Jue.
 Her father did not look domineering apart from being good-looking.
 “The leader of the Divine Spirits and our Heavenly Sage will jointly hold the Chaotic Assembly. All living beings below 100 million years old can participate and decide the top ten of the Chaos and the top in history,” Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du glanced at Han Jue and slowly said. It was the same as what Han Jue had learned from the Ultimate God of Punishment.
 The Sages were all excited and looked at him. The hall exploded upon seeing Han Jue nod.
 “In that case, the leader of the Divine Spirits has acknowledged that the Heavenly Sage is on the same level as him?”
 “That should be the case. No matter how strong the leader of the Divine Spirits is, can he be stronger than twenty thousand Divine Authority Generals?”
 “No wonder the Five Great Divine Punishers came. So, that’s their plan.”
 “Is there a need to? Who dares to question the strongest in the Chaos?”
 “The Heavenly Dao has so many geniuses. Let the Chaos see our foundation!”
 The Sages were extremely heroic and became more and more excited.
 The strongest in the Chaos?
 .
 Han Qing’er looked at Han Jue’s back in surprise.
 Father is so powerful?
 She also knew that the Chaos was endless. To be called the strongest, how strong was he?
 No wonder his disciple was a Freedom Sage.
 Han Qing’er’s expression became strange.
 My father is the strongest, so why should I cultivate?
 Who can harm me?
 Han Qing’er thought about Han Jue’s attitude. Perhaps all living beings thought that he was the strongest, but in fact, there was an existence that made him extremely afraid. It was precisely because of this that he had been in seclusion.
 Han Qing’er suddenly found a goal.
 It was definitely not to have fun!
 “The Chaotic Assembly will begin in ten million years. The Sages can prepare. To participate in such a meeting, a Sage will definitely have to appear. It will be embarrassing if we send a Pseudo-Sage,” Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said seriously.
 The Sages nodded, and their eyes burned with anticipation.
 The Heavenly Dao Sage only cared about the Heavenly Dao in the end. The Great Dao Divine Spirits cared about the Chaos!
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “Second, the Heavenly Dao has two more Sage positions.”
 They would have directly decided if it was in the past. But Han Jue was here today, so they had to seek his opinion.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du looked at him.
 Han Jue said, “A position should be given to Yang Tiandong.”
 Very direct!
 Han Qing’er was secretly nervous. Wasn’t her father afraid of offending the other Sages?
 Although he was the strongest, hidden enemies could always plot in the dark. Wasn’t he afraid of being abandoned by everyone? “Good! Amazing! That Yang Tiandong is indeed impressive. He managed the order of the netherworld in an orderly manner. The netherworld will probably not be convinced if he isn’t a Sage. As expected of a Heavenly Sage, he immediately chose the most suitable candidate!”
 Yang Che clapped in admiration.
 Xu Dudao added, “That’s right. Sages don’t only talk about talent, cultivation, and achievements. We control the Heavenly Dao not because of cultivation, but because of our overall vision and Dao heart that thinks for all living beings.”
 Qiu Xilai, Sect Master Tian Jue, Pan Xin, Heavenly Venerate Wufa, and the others began to flatter him.
 Han Jue’s disciples were stunned. They cursed them for being shameless and hurriedly flattered him.
 How could they let outsiders flatter their own master?
 The Foolish Sword Sage was calm. He felt that this was very normal. If not for Han Jue, the Heavenly Dao would be nothing. He could destroy the Heavenly Dao with a single strike.
 Han Qing’er looked at the scene in front of her and did not know whether to laugh or cry.
 She also saw clearly how important Han Jue was in the Heavenly Dao. He was even more important than Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du!
 Han Jue only wanted one Sage position and let them fight for the remaining one.
  Sages were Sages, after all. They had to be reasonable and would not fight until their faces turned red.
 After the Sage position was finalized, Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du mentioned the development of the Heavenly Dao. Recently, the Three Pure Sacred World vaguely showed signs of going against the Heavenly Dao. Other than poaching geniuses, the cultivators of the two sides conflicted when they wandered in the Chaos.
 But two tigers could not share one mountain.
 The Three Pure Sacred World had Great Dao Sages and Laozi.
 Laozi had established the Sword Dao and was the Dao Ancestor’s eldest disciple. Although his reputation was inferior to the Divine Might Heavenly Sage, the difference was not too great.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du looked at Han Jue and asked, “What if the Heavenly Dao and the Three Pure Sacred World conflict?”.
 Han Jue said casually, “You’re not even afraid of it. Why ask me?”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du immediately knew what was going on.
 The Foolish Sword Sage became excited.
 Does the Divine Might Heavenly Sage want to fight Laozi?


 Han Jue’s words were very casual, but they were domineering in the ears of the Sages.
 This was the Divine Might Heavenly Sage. He wasn’t afraid of anyone!
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du smiled and said, “I’m naturally not afraid. The one in charge of the Three Pure Sacred World is the Heavenly Lord of Primordial Beginning. As for my master, he’s in seclusion all year round. I’ll still choose the Heavenly Dao if we really force him to attack.”
 Han Jue nodded slightly and didn’t say anything else.
 Then, Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du instructed some things. The Sages dispersed after they discussed and finalized.
 Han Jue stood up, and Han Qing’er followed closely behind.
 Long Hao, Ji Xianshen, Fang Liang, Han Yu, Qin Ling, and the other Sages of the Hidden Sect surrounded him. They began to get close to Han Qing’er.
 Han Qing’er was flattered. She didn’t expect so many senior brothers, junior disciples, and even grand-disciples to be hidden among the Sages.
 Han Jue snorted. “Take care of her when she appears in the Heavenly Dao in the future. Otherwise, I’ll punish you. None of you can escape.”
  The other Sages had yet to walk out of the Universal Hall. Their expressions changed and they remembered these words.
 They weren’t stupid. They knew that Han Jue was also pointing at them.
 “Father, I’m a Pseudo-Sage. Who in the Immortal World can hurt me?” Han Qing’er refused to listen and said coquettishly. However, she was happy in her heart. It had been a long time since she felt such fatherly love, making her touched and ashamed.
 ......
 Han Jue smiled and didn’t reply.
 The disciples promised.
Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎 Red Fate twisted her waist and walked in front of Han Qing’er. She chuckled and said, “Heavenly Sage, why don’t you let me take your daughter as my disciple? I’ll definitely teach her all my Dao techniques.”
 With that said, the expressions of the Sages who wanted to take Han Qing’er in as their disciple changed drastically, but they did not dare to fight her.
 After all, Red Fate was a Great Dao Sage. She could suppress them with one hand.
 Han Qing’er was stunned by Red Fate’s appearance and temperament. She instinctively felt threatened, not for herself, but for her mother.
 She subconsciously looked at her father.
 Han Jue’s expression didn’t change as he said, “Let’s see what this girl thinks.”
 Han Qing’er said, “Father, I shouldn’t go to the Immortal World. I plan to cultivate with you for a million years before going out to train.”
 Han Jue looked at her in surprise and saw that she was serious.
 He was relieved. It seemed that the fortuitous encounter had made her understand.
 Han Jue waved his sleeve and disappeared with Han Qing’er.
 Red Fate sighed in pity.
 The Primordial Heavenly Prison made her loyal to Han Jue, but it didn’t erase her thoughts about him.
 Red Fate shook her head and disappeared.
 The Hidden Sect disciples were still discussing Han Qing’er. They were still very curious about this little junior sister. The news would probably spread throughout the Hidden Sect soon.
 On the other side.
 Han Jue brought Han Qing’er back to the third Dao Field.
 “Father, aren’t we going to see Eldest Mother and Second Mother?” Han Qing’er asked curiously.
 Han Jue said, “They have to cultivate, too. Don’t disturb them if you don’t have anything to say to them. To us, we don’t lack time.”
 Han Qing’er felt that it made sense. She hugged his right arm and said coquettishly, “Father, can you tell me your story again?”
 She was very curious about her father after this incident.
 Han Jue didn’t hide anything and told her his story again. Unlike Qingluan’er, he still wanted to show off to his daughter. Therefore, he deliberately emphasized their strength when he mentioned those enemies. Han Qing’er sometimes exclaimed.
 Han Jue finished speaking several hours later.
 It had to be said that although he had not experienced much, every single one of his experiences was a major event. Any one of them could be written into a novel.
 Furthermore, he had yet to talk about the Dark Forbidden Lord.
 .
 Looking at Han Qing’er again, this girl was already full of admiration, making Han Jue extremely happy.
 Han Qing’er said excitedly, as if she had found her goal.
 Han Qing’er said proudly, “Don’t worry about my potential!”
 With that, she waved her hand and left.
 Han Jue shook his head and laughed. He sat on the mat and started cultivating.
 Next was to break through!
 Under the old tree.
 Qingluan’er felt a gust of wind. She opened her eyes and saw her daughter standing in front of her.
 “Qing’er! Why are you back?” Qingluan’er asked in surprise.
 Han Qing’er smiled and said, “Mother, I understand. Cultivating is more important.”
 She didn’t explain further. She walked to the side and sat down to cultivate.
 Qingluan’er looked at her in a daze.
 For some reason, she saw Han Jue’s shadow on her daughter.
 It was not her looks, but a feeling.
 She was curious. What method did Han Jue use to change Han Qing’er’s personality?
 In the dark void.
 A dilapidated huge wooden ship advanced. It seemed like an invisible beast was pulling the ship.
 The five Divine Punishers were cultivating on the ship.
 Yi Tian was feeling bored when he suddenly saw Han Tuo smiling secretly.
 “What are you laughing at? You look so cheap.” Yi Tian yawned and asked casually.
 Han Tuo rolled his eyes and said, “I learned something in the Chaotic Domain just now. I have a younger sister.”
 Yi Tian immediately perked up when he heard that. “What’s our sister’s name?”
 “What sister?”
 “Hehe, I’m your big brother.”
 “Hehe.”
 “Tell me!”
 “Her name is Han Qing’er. She was born two hundred thousand years ago, and she’s already a Pseudo-Sage. She’s cultivating beside my father.”
 “Impressive. As expected of Godfather’s child. Ask your senior brothers when Godfather will acknowledge me.”
 Han Tuo snorted. “My senior brothers are also wandering outside. How can I ask them?”
 “That’s true. Dao Sovereign, Zhao Xuanyuan, and Jiang Yi are causing trouble everywhere. Many Great Dao Divine Spirits have already accused them. Speaking of which, they owe me a favor.”
 Yi Tian smiled and rolled his eyes. It was unknown what he was thinking.
 Han Tuo was about to speak when the huge wooden ship suddenly trembled.
 The Divine Punishers stood up one after another. Han Tuo was the same.
 He frowned and looked ahead.
 A huge stone tablet appeared in the darkness. It was riddled with holes. A terrifying wind blew, resisting the wooden ship.
 “What the hell is that?” Yi Tian asked in a low voice.
 There were countless holes on the huge stone tablet, and they seemed to be crawling. They looked like worms and bones, looking ghastly and terrifying
 Han Tuo’s heart beat faster for some reason. An uneasiness that had not appeared for a long time surged in his heart.


 “Prepare for battle!” Han Tuo said in a low voice. He raised his right hand and a terrifying black shadow condensed on his body, as if Han Jue was using the Grand Unity Aspect.
 The other four Divine Punishers were also prepared to fight.
 Their gazes landed on the huge stone tablet in front of them. Figures were surging from the countless caves. More and more appeared, as if it was an ant nest or a race was hidden
 inside.
 At this moment, blood words appeared on the surface of the stone tablet and interwove between the various holes. They were dense and made one’s scalp tingle.
 “Chaotic Fiendcelestial… Very good, you suit me very well!” a cold voice sounded. The language was strange, but the Five Great Divine Punishers were strong and could understand what he meant.
 Han Tuo raised his eyebrows and shouted, “Kill this thing!”
 The Five Great Divine Punishers attacked together. Dharmic powers shook the void. Five divine lights of different colors collided with the huge stone tablet and emitted a dazzling light that swept in all directions, causing the void to lose all color.
 In the third Dao Field.
  Han Jue focused on cultivating. The Primordial World in the depths of his soul continued to expand. His Supreme Powers strengthened and his understanding of the power of creation deepened.
 He began to break through.
 He successfully broke through five thousand years later!
 Mid-stage Great Dao Supreme Realm!
 Han Jue smiled. He finally broke through.
 He checked the emails.
 (Name: Han Jue] (Lifespan: 5,425,122 | 90,039,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,9 99,999,999,999,999)
 [Race: Primordial Fiendcelestial (Immeasurable Emperor)]
 (Cultivation: Mid-stage Great Dao Supreme Realm (Perfect Sage)]
 [Technique: Primordial Chaos Reincarnation Great Dao (Great Dao), Heavenly Cycle Body Tempering]
 [Great Dao: Great Dao of Life and Death, Great Dao of Karma, Great Dao of Extreme Origin]
 His lifespan had increased by nine times!
 Han Jue was in a good mood.
 It was a surprise as usual. Who would mind living longer?
 Han Jue began to consolidate his cultivation.
 Three thousand years later.
 His cultivation finally stabilized. He began to improve his Mystical Power next.
 Five hundred years later.
 Han Jue learned five hundred new Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols. He had 2,449 now.
 He was already very close to the three thousand Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols.
 However, there was still no Dao of Creation among these Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and started the simulation trial.
 It was still the Foolish Sword Sage.
 The Foolish Sword Sage of the Great Dao Supreme Realm was still stronger than the Divine Authority Generals. He was very suitable as a template.
 Han Jue challenged ten thousand Foolish Sword Sages in one go.
 Instant kill!
 How terrifying was that when 2,449 Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols fused together? They crushed everything in their path and directly killed ten thousand Foolish Sword Sages.
 Han Jue continued to challenge.
 Twenty thousand Foolish Sword Sages!
 He didn’t win even after fighting for an hour.
 He was not discouraged. Instead, he was excited.
 Only with difficulties could one have fighting spirit.
 Several days later.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and was satisfied.
 His limit was 25,000 Foolish Sword Sages. It was already very terrifying.
 After all, the Foolish Sword Sage was also a Great Dao Supreme!
 The Chaos would collapse if such a battle really happened!
  The current Chaos could not withstand so many Great Dao Supremacies.
 Han Jue wanted to curse the enemy to celebrate, but he suddenly didn’t know who to
 curse.
 The enemies were either dead or hiding. No one dared to provoke him on the surface.
 Han Jue felt inexplicably regretful.
 He was afraid of having too many enemies in the past, but now, he hoped that there would be too many.
 He couldn’t use his Mystical Powers without an enemy. “Looks like my Dao heart still needs refinement,” Han Jue muttered to himself with firm eyes.
 He thought about Ninth Chaos, about the Chaotic Consciousness, and then about the Formless Transcendent Deity. He still had a long way to go.
 Han Jue checked the emails.
 The recent circle of friends was not peaceful anymore. It was mainly Han Tuo, Dao Sovereign, and Huang Zuntian.
 Han Jue suddenly noticed that the Evil Heavenly Emperor and Ancestor Xitian had been very well-behaved recently, as if they had disappeared.
 These two leaders were both ambitious and must be plotting something.
 Han Jue called Han Qing’er in after reading the emails for a while.
 Han Qing’er was stuck at the perfected Pseudo-Sage Realm and could not attain the Dao.
 It was mainly because she had little experience and her Dao heart was unstable. She didn’t find her own Dao.
 Han Qing’er looked depressed after entering the temple. “Father, am I not talented?”
 She thought that her father wanted to scold her about cultivation.
 After all, she had not broken through in so many years. She was angry.
 Back then, she had said that she wanted to surpass her brother. Now, it seemed that she had been thinking too much.
 What was potential below the Sage Realm? She even wondered if she should go out and seek opportunities.

 Han Jue smiled. “Your potential is already good enough. I’ll help you attain the Dao.”
 “Really?”
 Han Qing’er was pleasantly surprised.
 Han Qing’er looked at him in admiration upon hearing this.
 She pounced into his arms and started to act spoiled.
 Han Jue pushed her away helplessly and said, “A woman can’t be too close to her father when she grows up. Do you understand? You’re no longer a child. You can’t be like this in the future. It looks inappropriate.”
 Han Qing’er giggled. “What? I’ll always be your daughter.”
 A hundred years of preaching passed in a flash.
 Han Qing’er opened her eyes and exclaimed, “What a powerful Dao. Father, what Dao is this?”
 “Great Dao of Extreme Origin.”
 “I see many figures walking on this Great Dao’s path. Who are they?”
 “My disciples. They also cultivate this Dao. Those before you are all stronger than you.”
 “So many?”
 Han Qing’er was shocked. At that time, she stood on the Great Dao of Extreme Origin and looked forward. She couldn’t see the end, but she could see many figures. The distance between them was greater than the Dao Pursuer behind her.
 She asked curiously, “Who’s the strongest among your disciples?”
 Han Jue pondered for a moment and said, “Murong Qi, my grand-disciple.”
 Murong Qi?
  Han Qing’er had never heard of this name. She had thought that it was Jiang Jieshi, but she didn’t expect that the terrifying Jiang Jieshi could not be ranked first.
 “Where’s Jiang Jueshi?”
 “Him? He’s not in the top ten. His cultivation level has not increased all these years. He’s still exploring his own Dao creation.”
 Han Jue smiled. He was telling the truth.
 Jiang Jueshi had broken through too quickly in this life and needed to settle down. Otherwise, his foundation would be unstable. Han Jue would personally teach him after some time.
 At this moment…
 A black vortex appeared behind Han Jue.
 Han Qing’er widened her eyes and was about to ask what this was when Han Jue stood up and struck out with his palm. A hand that had just emerged from the black vortex was slapped away by him.
 Han Jue sensed carefully. The one who used the Invocation Technique was Han Tuo, but he was chased by the enemy as soon as he used it.
 It seemed that this kid’s enemy was not simple!
