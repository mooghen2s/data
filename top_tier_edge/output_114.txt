 “Grandpa, this is my good brother, Chen Jue.’
 Chu Xiaoqi introduced him to Han Jue. Chen Jue came back to his senses and bowed.
 Han Jue said, “I know him.”
 Chu Xiaoqi was stunned and knew that something was wrong.
 Chen Jue raised his chin and smiled.
 Han Jue smiled and said, “I gave you your talent.”
 His
 gaze landed on Chen Jue, and his words stunned him.
 Chu Xiaoqi was also stunned and hurriedly asked, “What do you mean?”
 Han Jue smiled and said, “I will give some descendants talent every once in a while. Chen Jue should remember that his talent was not born with him, but awakened when he was young.”
 Chen Jue was moved and he trembled.
 Chu Xiaoqi thought of his recently awakened power of karma. Could it be…
 “What are you?” Chen Jue stared at him and asked in a low voice.
 Han Jue’s words broke his pride and made him unable to control himself.
 Han Jue smiled. “You’re my descendant. Who think I am?”
 do
 you
 Lord?
 Chu Xiaoqi’s eyed widened in disbelief. He was already a Great Dao Supreme and had naturally heard of the legend of the Lord. That was an ancient legend that had created the Endless Era!
 Chen Jue turned to look at Chu Xiaoqi and said, “I didn’t tell you. Actually, I’m a descendant of the Han family. The same Han family as Primordial Fiendcelestial Han Huang and Creation Emperor Court’s Emperor. I received Emperor’s help in the
 past, that’s why so I could grow so quickly.”
 He was also extremely uneasy.
 Chu Xiaoqi was dumbfounded.
 So you’re the real grandson!
 Han Jue smiled and said, “Since you’re here, I’ll preach the Dao for you and give you an opportunity. After this farewell, when we meet again, you’ll have already embarked on
 the path of fighting for the peak. I’ll look down on you at the end of my cultivation and wait for your impact.”
 These words made their blood boil.
 Han Jue pulled them into a state of Dao
 After an unknown period of time, the two of
 them woke up almost at the same time.
 They looked around, but Han Jue was already
 gone.
 Chu Xiaoqi couldn’t even capture his aura
 anymore. He was in a daze. Recalling his experience with Han Jue, everything felt like a
 dream.
 Chen Jue sighed. “I didn’t expect your
 grandfather to be the illusory Lord in the
 legends. This is indeed the greatest
 opportunity. Although I’m his descendant, if
 not for your introduction, I might not have
 met him in my life.”
 He had mixed emotions.
 His progenitor had actually personally
 nurtured Chu Xiaoqi. What did this mean? In
 the eyes of the Lord, Chu Xiaoqi had more
 potential?
 After all, he was the outsider.
 “Can you tell me about your Han family?
 Chen Jue didn’t hide anything and told him
 everything he knew about the Han family. Chu Xiaoqi was only curious at first, but as he listened, he was shocked.
 Why were there so many experts in the Han
 family?
 Many of them were famous!
 Chu Xiaoqi suddenly had a thought.
 His master had taken a liking to him. Could it
 be that he wanted to cozy up to the Han family?
 …
 Han Jue returned to the third Dao Field. His
 clones were still nurturing the descendants who had obtained the Creation Heaven’s Chosen. The reason why he returned was that
 he sensed something.
 He sat on the lotus throne and began to
 deduce the future.
 Countless future branches entered his eyes. This was an extremely huge memory. Even Sages would not be able to withstand it.
 Han Jue’s eyes narrowed. All the futures shattered and the spatial fragments condensed into a straight line.
 Origin Space-time!
 He had previously sent a clone to investigate
 the Origin Space-time. Although he could find it, he discovered that it was hidden too deeply and isolated by the basic rules. Even Dao
 Ji Xianshen was lucky. Perhaps it was a choice of the Origin Space-time.
 This time, the Origin Space-time appeared. Although it was still under the basic rules, it
 was different from the past. It was illusory and scattered in the past, but it condensed into a true spatial river now.
 This change made Han Jue feel uneasy. The uneasiness came from the unknown.
 The blank domain would indeed produce a new change, making him, an invincible existence, no longer so omnipotent. Just like the Primordial Fiendcelestial and the
 Ninth Chaos in the past, if not for the power of the blank domain constantly transforming, their invincibility might not be inferior to Han Jue’s dominance of the current era. Han Jue stared at the Origin Space-time and saw that it began to change. It began to
 distort from a straight line. The power of space-time dissipated and kept condensing into stronger lines. Not long after, the Origin Space-time became like a snake. One end was
 larger like a snake’s head, and the other end was slender like a snake’s tail.
 Its name appeared in Han Jue’s mind.
 Origin Divine Millet!
 The Origin Divine Millet’s head faced Han Jue,
 and a pair of eyes appeared. It was a pair of
 extremely cold eyes.
 It stared at him. Han Jue frowned. He debated whether to
 eliminate this thing. He could destroy the other party with a thought, but the Origin Space-time could recreate it.
 He tried to deduce this item, but he failed.
 “I want to know why the Origin Divine Millet was born,” Han Jue asked in his mind. [10 duodecillion years of origin lifespan will
 be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 So expensive!
 It was indeed extraordinary. Han Jue silently chose to continue.
 His consciousness was pulled into the illusion.
 It had been a long time since he had felt this way. It actually made him sigh.
 He opened his eyes and discovered that he
 was standing in front of the Transcendent Divine Hall. It was the Dao Field established by the Formless Transcendent Deity. Above the Transcendent Divine Hall stood many figures. They were densely packed and numbered at least a hundred thousand. There was no lack of Dao Creators among them. His children and descendants, Chu Xiaoqi, Ru Daolong, Chen Jue, and Han Liang were also here.
 They all looked up at the paleness. That was the independent plane that Han Jue
 had created previously, the opportunity he had left behind.
 What was going on?
 Han Jue frowned and watched patiently.
 A crack appeared above the Transcendent
 Divine Hall, interwoven with endless red lightning. The terrifying aura was enough to turn a Dao Creator into ashes.
 A figure appeared in the crack. It was not Han Jue, but a white-haired man with a cold expression. His hair was disheveled and he
 wore a blood-red robe. Behind him stood three strange and terrifying demon statues that looked down at all existences.
 Han Jue frowned even more. Who was this?
 Why had he never seen him before?
 “What did you do to the Lord?” the Formless Transcendent Deity shouted in a low voice,
 his tone filled with vigilance.


 “Lord? He died long ago!”
 The white-haired man snorted coldly with a disdainful expression. He raised his arms and the three demon statues behind him grew
 taller. Soon, they became even larger than the Transcendent Divine Hall.
 The mighty figures below were in an uproar. They were furious and thought that the white-haired man had killed the Lord. The first people to attack were Han Jue’s children and descendants. Immediately after, the other mighty figures all attacked.
 More than a hundred thousand Great Dao Supremes attacked together. How terrifying was that? A strong light burst out, causing the blank domain to darken.
 The illusion shattered.
 Han Jue’s consciousness returned to reality.
 “Who is that white-haired man?” Han Jue asked in his mind.
 [Unable to deduce its karma. He might not exist or have a Supreme Treasure.]
 He could deduce the Origin Divine Millet but not the white-haired man, it meant that the white-haired man was not the Origin Divine Millet.
 Then who was it?
 The birth of the Origin Divine Millet was for that white-haired man?
 Han Jue frowned and pondered.
 He asked in his mind, “Will the Origin Divine Millet threaten me?”
 [10 duodecillion years of origin lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [No, the Origin Divine Millet is not offensive unless it is controlled by someone.]
 Controlled by someone…
 Han Jue disappeared from the lotus throne and appeared next to the basic rules to face the Origin Divine Millet.
 The Origin Divine Millet didn’t panic when it saw him. Instead, it approached him.
 Its snake form looked terrifying and cold, but Han Jue clearly felt that it wanted to get close to him.
 Han Jue reached out and touched its head. In
 an instant, his calm heart rippled.
 They had established some special
 connection.
 “Won’t it be more appropriate if I control the Origin Divine Millet?” Han Jue thought silently. He had to be wary of the
 white-haired man in the illusion.
 Han Jue took the crystalline Origin Divine
 Millet and returned to the Daoist temple.
 “Stay by my side in the future.” Han Jue
 smiled.
 The Origin Divine Millet flew out of his palm and became two meters long. It wrapped around him like the Strange Deity back then, getting close to him.
 He glanced at the Ninth Chaos in the corner.
 He still didn’t succeed in enslaving this fellow. Han Jue was waiting anxiously now. Perhaps he could learn the white-haired man’s identity from the Ninth Chaos.
 He searched the entire Endless Era but did not see the white-haired man. There was also a possibility that the white-haired man had yet to be born.
 He closed his eyes after some thinking.
 His clones returned one after another in the
 next few hundred years. As for the descendants who had obtained the Creation Heaven’s Chosen, they were already
 independent.
 …
 Time passed.
 Another five hundred million years went by.
 He had accumulated fifty Creation Heaven’s
 Chosen attempts. As for the reward, it had to be triggered once every billion years.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and smiled in
 satisfaction.
 His cultivation level had increased greatly in
 The Ultimate Origin World gained two more Supreme Rules, but they were still hidden. However, the mighty figures could sense the increase in the Ultimate Origin World and guessed that Han Jue was getting stronger. A Great Dao World also appeared in the
 The other mighty figures felt even less pressure after someone successfully established the Great Dao World. The news
 that the Ultimate Origin World could withstand other Great Dao Worlds quickly
 spread, attracting more mighty figures to
 join.
 Han Jue looked at a figure meditating beside him, the Ninth Chaos.
 The Ninth Chaos had already been successfully enslaved and transformed into an Ultimate Origin Lifeform.
 The Ninth Chaos opened his eyes and bowed respectfully upon Sensing his gaze. Han Jue asked him to sit down. The Origin Divine Millet came over curiously. “Where is your mental demon?” Han Jue
 asked.
 The Ninth Chaos replied, “I’m not sure either. I severed my connection with him when I split him out. I was plotting to deal with you
 worst.
 Han Jue felt a trace of admiration for this once-invincible person. This was also the first enemy who could escape the Ultimate Origin Heavenly Prison but still take revenge on him.
 “Do you know this person?”
 Han Jue waved his right hand, and the
 white-haired man’s figure appeared in front of him.
 The Ninth Chaos frowned. “I don’t know him,
 ||
 The Ninth Chaos had also seen him in his dreams?
 Han Jue was interested.
 person would
 Could it be that every invincible face this white-haired man? Han Jue asked some more questions. The
 Ninth Chaos told him everything he knew. The Ninth Chaos’ understanding of the blank domain was inferior to Han Jue’s. He didn’t even know what the basic rules were. This fellow was already at the perfected Dao
 Han Jue said, “Go out. You can sit whatever
 you want in the future as long as it doesn’t affect me.”
 “Yes.”
 The Ninth Chaos nodded. Han Jue waved his
 hand and sent him out.
 He continued to think about the white-haired
 man.
 Who was that fellow?
 Could it be formed by the will of the blank domain?
 Blank Domain, unknown place.
 The Ninth Chaos appeared under a huge
ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels divine tree. He sat on a mat and waved his hand to create eight Chaotic Wills. The First Chaos looked at him in surprise and asked, “You’re still alive?”
 The Ninth Chaos said, “Yes, the Divine Might Heavenly Sage is kind and didn’t kill us.”
 The other Chaotic Wills heaved a sigh of relief. They understood what the Ninth Chaos
 meant. They were also afraid of fighting Han Jue to death. The difference between the two was too great. It would not be beneficial to them if they fought to the death.
 The Ninth Chaos continued, “All of you will cultivate here in the future. In ten billion years, I will no longer interfere in the matters
 of all living beings. You should put down your obsession and cultivate well.”
 The other Chaos had no objections. Figures appeared at this moment. They were the Formless Transcendent Deity, the Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity, the Chaotic
 Consciousness, and Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction Venerable.
 They were all shocked to see the Ninth Chaos.
 The Ninth Chaos had contacted them previously, but he had not appeared. He did not hide his aura this time. Wasn’t he afraid of being discovered by the Divine Might Heavenly Sage?


ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels The Ninth Chaos’ expression did not change as he faced the four Dao Creators.
 The Chaotic Consciousness asked, “What are you doing?”
 He and Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction Venerable were panicking. After all, they had already secretly reached an agreement with the Ninth Chaos’ dark side. In the end, the Ninth Chaos suddenly appeared, catching them off guard.
 The four Dao Creators immediately understood that the Ninth Chaos had been subdued by Han Jue with some method. Only the Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity knew what was going on. The other three were very shocked.
 Even the once-strongest Ninth Chaos became like this…
 The Divine Might Heavenly Sage still had a trace of hope for the Ninth Chaos’ dark side.
 Even the Chaotic Consciousness lost confidence.
 The four Dao Creators did not ask further and left.
 The Ninth Chaos shook his head and muttered, “Actually, this is also good. Perhaps I can break through better without the strongest restrictions.”
 In the past, he was always worried that he would be surpassed by his juniors when he was cultivating. He was worried that he would suffer a backlash if he failed to break through. He was worried that the Chaos would be destroyed. He worried about too many things, making him unable to cultivate in peace.
 The Ninth Chaos did not affect the Endless Era. Only the Dao Creators knew that in a corner of the Ultimate Origin World that no one knew, the Chaos began to be nurtured.
 The Ninth Chaos was absolutely loyal to Han Jue after passing through the Ultimate Origin Heavenly Prison. He naturally treated his mental demons as enemies and would be wary of them.
 Han Jue entered seclusion again.
 In the blink of an eye, two hundred million years passed.
 [Detected that you are 2 billion years old and your life has taken another huge step forward. You have the following choices:]
 [1: Exit seclusion immediately and clean up all living beings. Create all living beings that belong to you. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment, a Primordial Fragment, a Creation Spirit Stone, and a chance to upgrade the system function.]
 [2: Cultivate in a low-profile manner and maintain your original intention. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment, a Primordial Fragment, a Creation Spirit Stone, and a chance to upgrade the system function.]
 [You have obtained a Creation Heaven’s Chosen attempt.]
 The rewards for both options were the same. This time, the system function upgrade was a pleasant surprise.
 Han Jue silently chose the second option.
 He began to consider which system function to upgrade.
 He then thought of the white-haired man.
 “Upgrade the derivation function.”
 [The derivation function increases with your cultivation. It can’t be upgraded anymore.]
 It still didn’t work.
 Then forget it. I’ll keep it for now.
 Han Jue didn’t rely on the system now. To him, the system was just for fun. “Unknowingly, I’m two billion years old.”
 Han Jue sighed.
 Although time was meaningless to him, with the system’s reminder, he couldn’t help but reminisce.
 He looked at the blank domain after he calmed down.
 Xing Hongxuan had already found her goal, which was to give opportunities to the cultivators who were still insignificant. She had helped countless cultivators, and the number of cultivators who finally rose was very impressive. Because of this, she gained a divine name.
 Prominent Divine Dream Mother.
 She gave opportunities to little cultivators in their dreams and left them by the fated person’s side. Every person who obtained the opportunity could only see her figure and hear her voice in their dreams. They couldn’t see her true appearance. Han Jue wanted to laugh, but he had no choice. All living beings liked to call powerful goddesses their mothers. Xing Hongxuan had accumulated a huge amount of power of faith by relying on her divine name. Her cultivation level had actually increased and reached the Great Dao Supreme Realm.
 She had really found the right path. Han Jue thought silently. Xing Hongxuan watched as the
 cultivators she had given the first opportunity on the path of cultivation rose. She felt a sense of achievement. Everyone had a different path of growth, making her feel that it was very novel. She did not tire of it.
 Han Jue didn’t care upon seeing that she was doing well.
 As for the other Dao Companions, Li Yao had already successfully condensed the first Supreme Rule. Qingluan’er, Xuan Qingjun, Fairy Xi Xuan, Dao Comprehension Sword, Chang Yue’er, Mo Zhu, and the others were still working hard. They rarely went out and were already used to cultivating. They could be considered pure-hearted and had few desires. Like most mighty
 figures, they had reached the point where they had no desires. Han Jue looked at the Dao Mystic Realm next. Primordial Origin retreated hundreds of millions of years ago. The Dao Mystic Realm was thought to have won. Its morale increased greatly and its domain expanded by dozens of times. They had countless living beings.
 Then, the three Primordial Chaos fused into one Primordial Chaos. Someone joked that Primordial Origin had been defeated by the Dao Mystic Realm.
 “Not bad. This path is feasible.” Han Jue thought silently. Han Huang and Huang Zuntian were both his people. It was very difficult for
 As for whether they could break through, it depended on the improvement after their bloodlines fused.
 …
 Could the three demon statues behind the white-haired man be the three
 Primordial Fiendcelestials?
 But they were among the mighty figures facing the white-haired man. It didn’t make sense.
 Han Jue frowned. He felt uneasy when he thought of the white-haired man.
 From his height, the unknown power was a threat!
 Han Jue immediately sent a dream to the Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity and asked him to monitor the Endless Era.
 He was to immediately tell him if a white-haired man appeared. It was always good to have another method.
 Actually, there was another way, which was to destroy all living beings and create new ones from scratch. However, Han Jue felt that that was even more unreliable.
 He had a feeling that once he did that, the basic rules would resist him.
 The premonition of the Creator Lord was basically true.
 “I’m still not strong enough. Perhaps I’ll only be the true strongest if the
 Ultimate Origin World replaces the blank domain.”


 Primordial Chaos.
 The Primordial Chaos became the largest Great Dao World other than the Ultimate Origin World in the Endless Era ever since the three Primordial Chaos fused.
 As for the Dao Creators, their Great Dao Worlds had been fused by the Chaos. As the Chaos shattered, their Great Dao Worlds had already transformed into countless worlds. Of course, they might have secretly created their own Great Dao Worlds again, but they did not reveal it.
 Everyone in the Endless Era had various opinions, but the three Primordial Fiendcelestials and the Dao
 Ancestor did not appear. They were all working hard to break through to the Dao Creator Realm.
 Their efforts also led the other top mighty figures. More and more perfected Great Dao Supremes disappeared from the vision of all living beings. New and old alternated. In the long years, many new influential figures appeared, including talented people.
 The Chaotic Assembly was still ongoing. It could be considered the most prosperous era since ancient times. In the recent Chaotic Assembly, the Ten Absolutes were all living beings of the new era. Races born after the Endless Era began to appear.
 Creation Emperor Court.
 The Creation Emperor Court was surrounded by dozens of Great Dao Worlds. Below the Creation Emperor Court was Han Ling’s Great Dao World. It was the most vast, and countless living beings flew in and out.
 At this moment, in the central palace of the Creation Emperor Court.
 Han Ling sat at the head of the table. The divine light on her body looked extremely solemn.
 Three figures were in the hall. They were Han Yao, Han Ye, and Han Bashen. Han Ye knelt on the ground and was pressed down by the other two. He could not move.
 “Han Ye, do you know your mistake?”
 Han Ling’s voice sounded indifferent.
 Han Ling was silent.
 Han Ye snorted and did not reply.
 Han Bashen advised in a low voice, “Apologize. More than ten Great Dao Worlds want to capture you now, including the Dao Mystic Realm. There’s a Dao Creator behind it.”
 “So what if he’s a Dao Creator? I…”
 Han Ye wanted to mention Han Jue, but after so many years, was he still qualified to mention him?
 Too many experts had risen from the descendants of the Han family. He, a descendant who had experienced the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity, didn’t seem so outstanding. Would Han Jue really still favor him?
ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels Han Ye was not confident.
 After all, he also had descendants. Not to mention hundreds of millions of years of not interacting, as long as they were separated for ten million years, he did not care about them anymore.
 Han Ye hesitated, but the pressure brought by the Dao Creator was too great, making him unable to refuse.
 He would definitely encounter trouble once he went out.
 Han Yao immediately picked him up and said, “I’ll imprison him now!”
 Han Bashen followed.
 This Han Ye really made her worry.
 After a while, a golden light rushed into the hall.
 The golden light dissipated and Murong Qi appeared. He looked at Han
 Ling and smiled. “Your Majesty, long time no see.”
 “Why are you here?” Han Ling opened her eyes and asked. Her tone was calm and not as curious as she appeared. Murong Qi smiled. “Grandmaster’s Great Dao Providence Divine Authority has appeared. It’s in a small world without any major factions controlling it. Now, all the mighty figures have already gone to surround it and are in a stalemate. What do you think?” Han Ling asked, “You want it? One is not enough.” Murong Qi raised his eyebrows. “I’ll help you obtain it. Give me the Primordial Divine Spear.” The Primordial Divine Spear was a Supreme Treasure that surpassed the Chaotic Supreme Treasure. It had once made a name for itself in Han Huang’s hands and later landed in Han Ling’s hands. Han Ling smiled faintly. “Are their values equal? Besides, what help can you give me?”
 “No matter how strong you are, you still need someone to put on a show for you and give you a chance. If you let the people from the Creation Emperor Court do it, you will be exposed sooner or later and make a fool of yourself.” Han Ling was silent.
 Murong Qi waited patiently. After a long time. Han Ling said, “Alright!”
 Murong Qi smiled.
 …
 500 million years passed quickly.
 In the Dao Field.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and stretched habitually. “Not bad. My cultivation level has increased greatly over the years. I’ve also made some progress in the true meaning of the basic rules,” Han Jue muttered to himself with a smile. Compared to when he had just broken through to the Creator Lord Realm, he was already several times stronger. Not to mention the Creator Lord Realm, such improvement was unbelievable even at the Dao Creator Realm.
 The once strongest expert, the Ninth Chaos, wanted to break through a minor realm. It was not possible to succeed in billions of years. Han Jue began to check his emails. An abundance of emails had accumulated. Almost all his friends had taken action.
 Ji Xianshen and Fang Liang finally appeared. They had already found Heavenly Venerate Xun, and the three of them officially joined forces.
 Han Jue then thought of Dao Sovereign, Zhao Xuanyuan, and Jiang Yi. They were also a trio. Dao Sovereign and the other two were still battle maniacs, but Lao Dan had lost them. Han Jue calculated and saw that Lao Dan had already disappeared and fused with Laozi.
 Murong Qi had made a name for himself in the past five hundred million years. He became a true War God after acquiring the Primordial Divine Spear. He ran rampant in the Endless Era and challenged mighty figures everywhere.
 The owner of the Divine Authority System that Han Jue had placed in the mortal world was taken in by Han Ling.
 Han Jue only smiled.
 It was unknown if the Creation Emperor Court could subdue this master.
 Too many new faces appeared in the
 Chosen also grew up and dominated an area.
 As all living beings flourished, the blank domain also produced many new opportunities!


 Han Jue took in everything and sighed.
 There were really opportunities everywhere. It was good to be born in such an era.
 Han Jue suddenly raised his eyebrows.
 With more geniuses, the atmosphere changed.
 Many geniuses even began to fantasize about challenging the Lord!
 Han Jue had not shown his divinity in front of all living beings for billions of years, causing the junior geniuses to think that he was not all that. Naturally, some arrogant people appeared. Han Jue only snorted.
 “I’ll give you a chance. I’ll make you despair in the future.”
 Han Jue’s eyes flickered. He began to look forward to the feeling of showing off in front of these geniuses.
 He stood up and walked out of the Daoist temple to visit his Dao Companions and children. He rested for thousands of years before continuing to cultivate.
 Now, even if he did not cultivate, the Ultimate Origin World could develop on its own and help him increase his cultivation. However, his cultivation would increase even faster if he cultivated.
 Dao Mystic Realm, in the void.
 Chu Xiaoqi sat down. He trembled and his head twisted crazily. It was so fast that he formed afterimages. A terrifying demonic shadow could be vaguely seen.
 Chen Jue stood in the distance and frowned at him.
 “What’s going on? Why did his karma power lose control?”
 Chen Jue was puzzled, but he did not dare to disturb him. The current Chu Xiaoqi was stronger than him.
 The two of them had cultivated in this void for hundreds of thousands of years, but Chu Xiaoqi suddenly lost control today. His Dharmic powers became extremely irritable and even space shook. This void seemed to shatter at any other time, forcing Chen Jue to stabilize it.
 Three figures appeared behind Chu Xiaoqi at this moment. Their bodies shone with a strong light as they attacked together and pressed down on his back.
 “Stop!” Chen Jue shouted angrily and flashed in front of Chu Xiaoqi. His Dharmic powers erupted and countless golden sword shadows burst out from his eyes, wanting to destroy the
 three mysterious figures.
 However, the golden sword shadow passed
 through three figures harmlessly. It was as if it
 passed through shadows.
 The figure in the middle smiled and said,
 “We’re helping him. Do you know his
 identity?”
 Chen Jue asked in a low voice, “Who are you?”
 The figure on the left smiled teasingly. “This brother of yours is not simple. Have you heard of the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity? He played a very important role in it.”
 Chen Jue’s heart was filled with uneasiness. He did not answer and continued to cast spells. However, no matter what Mystical Power he used, he could not hurt the three mysterious figures. He tried to move Chu Xiaoqi, but the latter’s Dharmic powers were too ferocious.
 He was shocked. Although he was not Chu Xiaoqi’s match in the recent spar, it was not to the extent of being unshakable.
 Could this kid really be the reincarnation of some mighty figure?
 However, they were already perfected Great
 Dao Supremes. Could it be that Chu Xiaoqi was the reincarnation of a Dao Creator?
 “His true identity is Primordial Despair. He’s the number one ferocious devil of the Ancient Era. He once devoured more than a thousand Great Dao Sages and countless small worlds,” the figure in the middle said with a sigh.
 Chen Jue was stunned.
 Primordial Despair!
 He had naturally heard of this name. Primordial Despair had once brought despair to all living beings before the Endless Era arrived.
 At that time, all Chaotic mighty figures joined forces to stop Primordial Despair. It could be said to be the most terrifying ferocious devil since ancient times.
 Chu Xiaoqi suddenly opened his eyes. They were blood-red, and his face quickly became sinister. He slowly stood up and his blood Qi exploded, covering his robe. The blood wind wreaked havoc in all directions and tore cracks in the void. Space-time hurricanes surged over. The space in front of Chen Jue shattered. Chu Xiaoqi and the three mysterious figures fell into the darkness and disappeared.
 Chen Jue immediately chased them. He was struck by a mysterious and powerful force as soon as he entered the spatial turbulence. His body was instantly destroyed and he felt dizzy. He felt that everything was spinning.
 He discovered that he was lying in ruins when
 he regained consciousness.
 This was a city in the mortal world. Because of
 his fall, the entire city collapsed and all the living beings died.
 Chen Jue stood up. His body had already recovered. He was about to move when wisps of black aura wrapped around his limbs. He looked down and paused.
 Chu Xiaoqi’s power of karma!
 The mysterious power that attacked him earlier was Chu Xiaoqi’s power?
 But it was clearly so unfamiliar…
 Could that be the power of Primordial Despair?
 Chen Jue gritted his teeth and disappeared. He quickly went to find Formless World. Chu Xiaoqi and Chen Jue were both top
 existences in the Dao Mystic Realm and were deeply favored by Formless World. Chen Jue thought of him first since he had a Dao Creator
 as a backer.
 In the hall.
 Formless World frowned after hearing what Chen Jue said.
 That kid was actually Primordial Despair…
 Distant memories surfaced in his mind, causing his heart to shiver. Primordial Despair had traumatized him back then, making him afraid just thinking about it.
 Chen Jue said, “Those three mysterious existences definitely want to use Chu Xiaoqi. Perhaps he’s not Primordial Despair and has only obtained its power.”
 Formless World said, “I know about this. I’m
 going to visit the Great Deity now. Don’t interfere anymore, lest something happens.” With that, Formless World vanished.
 Chen Jue left.
 He couldn’t only place his hopes on him.
 A hundred million years later.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and called Han Huang,
 who had been waiting outside the Daoist temple, in. Han Huang quickly walked in and bowed. Then, he looked up and asked, “Father, is Chu
 Xiaoqi really Primordial Despair?”
 Han Jue nodded.
 Han Huang’s expression darkened. Han Jue knew what happened outside. Chu Xiaoqi had awakened the power of Primordial Despair. Because of the conflict between the
 two forces in this life and his previous life, his consciousness fell into chaos. At this moment, he was delirious and was used by Ji Xianshen,
 Heavenly Venerate Xun, and Fang Liang to devour Great Dao Worlds everywhere, causing all living beings in the blank domain to panic. They were elusive and difficult to track.
 Han Jue smiled and asked, “What are you going to do?”
 Han Huang said in a low voice, “Of course I’m
 saving him. Father, I’m sorry. I disappointed you.
 “That’s your business. You can decide for yourself. I won’t interfere, and the Dao Creators won’t make a move,” Han Jue said
 calmly. Han Huang was not disappointed. He bowed again and left.
 The battle between the three Primordial Chaos and Heavenly Venerate Xun officially began. Han Jue looked into the depths of the blank domain. His eyes turned cold.
 “You want to use Primordial Despair to confuse others? You’re overestimating yourself.” Han Jue chuckled. The reason why Chu Xiaoqi awakened the power of Primordial Despair was precisely because of the Ninth Chaos’ mental
 demon. This fellow even found Ji Xianshen, Fang Liang, and Heavenly Venerate Xun to secretly add fuel to the fire. Han Jue decided to make his move!
