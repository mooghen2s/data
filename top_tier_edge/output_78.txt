 The Ultimate Origin Soul Oblivion could condense into seven divine soul oblivion light blades that swept through all living beings!
 Han Jue thought of this Mystical Power by using the Seven Supreme Rules.
 He began the simulation trial and fought the Nine-Headed Divine Spirit.
 He killed the Divine Spirit in a breath of time.
 However, this could not show how powerful the Mystical Power was. After all, his cultivation level had already surpassed the Nine-Headed Divine Spirit. He could use other Mystical Powers to insta-kill it.
 Han Jue challenged a hundred Nine-Headed Divine Spirits in one go and used this to show the Ultimate Origin Soul Oblivion’s power.
 Five minutes later, Han Jue opened his eyes.
 “Not bad. Compared to the Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal, the Ultimate Origin Soul Oblivion can show the destructive power of the Ultimate Origin Fiendcelestial more.”
 Han Jue thought like this. The Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal was almost close to being omnipotent. It could attack and defend, it could control and seal, but it couldn’t show the strongest destructive power of the Ultimate Origin Power.
 The Ultimate Origin Soul Oblivion was the apex of power. It did not have any other use except to destroy. It was even stronger than the Divine Might Great Heaven Palm.
 e
 The Divine Might Great Heaven Palm could also destroy everything, but it was not agile enough. However, the Ultimate Origin Soul Oblivion was different. The seven divine soul oblivion light blades continued to exist and destroy the enemy endlessly!
 Facing the Ultimate Origin Soul Oblivion, the powerful Nine-Headed Divine Spirit could only defend passively.
 The Ultimate Origin Soul Oblivion could penetrate all the power of rules and array formations. It also contained extreme destructive power!
 If not for the Ninth Chaos, Han Jue could have relied on the Ultimate Origin Soul Oblivion to directly destroy the Chaos.
 That’s right, his Ultimate Origin Power could already injure the foundational order of the Chaotic Space!
 Han Jue’s Ultimate Origin Soul Oblivion had already reached its peak state after dozens of simulation trials.
 He really wanted to find an opponent who could fight to his heart’s content!
 Unfortunately, the Ninth Chaos appeared in his dream. Otherwise, Han Jue would have copied it.
 He was looking forward to the power of the Dao Creator.
 Han Jue smiled and nodded.
 Against his daughter, he naturally could not use the Ultimate Origin Soul Oblivion. If that happened, this girl’s Dao heart would definitely shatter.
 Just like before, Han Jue stood still. Han Ling couldn’t break through his defense and could only lose.
 Han Ling stared at his robe and said, “Father, what level are the Dharma treasures on you?”
 She could sense that her father really didn’t attack. He relied on his Dharma treasures to withstand all the damage from the million Emperor Soldiers.
 Han Jue smiled and said, “It’s a secret.”
 He had to keep it a secret from his daughter.
 What if she let it slip one day?
 Han Ling curled her lips and sighed. “Father, how many mighty figures like you are in the Chaos, and how many existences are stronger than you?”
 Han Jue said, “Many. At my cultivation level, most of them are cultivating in seclusion in their respective domains. In any case, I’m definitely not the strongest. I cultivate hard so that I can reach the strongest level as soon as possible.”
 Han Ling’s expression turned solemn and her eyes became even more determined.
 Han Jue asked with a faint smile, “Oh? Only the second strongest? You don’t want to surpass me?”
 Han Ling smiled. “I definitely want to surpass you, but I can’t say it every day.”
 That was normal.
 Han Jue couldn’t help but laugh.
 Unless he used the Primordial Heavenly Prison, Han Jue’s children naturally wanted to surpass him.
 If Han Jue had a powerful father, he would want to surpass him no matter how much he respected or liked him.
 Han Jue’s gaze on Han Ling softened. He began to preach the Dao to his daughter.
 In the blue sky, countless swords hung upside down. They were of all kinds and were extremely magnificent.
 A small pavilion in the sky stood above the clouds.
 Laozi sat in the pavilion. There were green jade fragments on the table. He was studying them.
 At this moment, a figure appeared beside him and sat down.
 Laozi did not turn his head. He ignored it and continued to stare at the fragments on the table.
 “There is indeed a Great Dao World hidden below the bottom of the Chaos. It’s not smaller than the Chaos, but it’s suppressed by the rules of the Chaos. The entire Great Dao World is divided into two. The power of the Chaos transforms into the ground and covers the entire Great Dao World,” the figure said with an ancient voice, as if sighing about time and the Great Dao.
 Laozi glanced at him and asked, “What do you mean?”
 The figure said, “This is an opportunity.”
 Laozi was silent.
 “Your Great Dao World has always been hidden, but how long can it be hidden? You will definitely be exposed when you break through to a higher realm. That will be a calamity. But you might have a chance of survival if you can join forces with the other Great Dao World Lords,” the figure continued
 Laozi looked at him and asked, “Teacher, where’s your Great Dao World?”.
 Teacher!
 There was only one person who could be called Teacher by Laozi, the Dao Ancestor!
 The figure was the Dao Ancestor!
 The Dao Ancestor replied, “My Great Dao World is the Heavenly Dao.”
 Laozi chuckled and did not say anything else.
 “Sorry, Teacher. Regardless of whether you’re plotting or concerned, I no longer need it. My Great Dao World will transform into a sword and tear apart this Chaos to cut down the three thousand Great Dao.
 “There are always new and old alternations. Chaos replaces the Primordial Chaos. The Heavenly Dao can replace the Chaos. The Heavenly Dao is not the end.”
 In the mysterious domain.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor bowed. In front of him was a majestic and blurry figure. It was a Transcendent Dao Expert, the Formless Transcendent Deity.
 “Senior, why are you looking for me?” the Evil Heavenly Emperor asked without looking up.
 He was on guard.
 In the past, he had always been the one to take the initiative to find the Formless Transcendent Deity. This was the first time he had been summoned.
 The Formless Transcendent Deity had always said that he did not touch karma. But he took the initiative to look for him this time. There must be something. If there was, it meant that he wanted to touch karma.
 This old senior was not honest.
 “Evil Heavenly Emperor, what are your plans for the future? The Heavenly Court is not the righteous path. You should already understand.” The Formless Transcendent Deity’s voice was ethereal and his tone was calm.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor frowned. “I’m not sure, either. Perhaps that’s all.”
 In fact, he had been confused for a long time. The Heavenly Court had developed into a bottleneck. If he continued to attack, he would easily offend a large faction and cause chaos in the region, attracting the Great Dao Divine Spirits’ punishment.
 Unlike Han Huang, Zhao Shuangquan, Azure Heaven Mystic, and the other geniuses, the Evil Heavenly Emperor had long lost his goal in cultivation. His current mentality was to muddle along. It would be fun if he could take in more geniuses.


 “If not for the fact that you accidentally entered my domain back then, it would have been difficult for you to interact today. I’ve been observing you,” the Formless Transcendent Deity said slowly, causing the Evil Heavenly Emperor’s heart to beat faster.
 What had the Evil Heavenly Emperor not experienced before? He naturally understood what the other party meant.
 The expert was recruiting him as a trusted aide.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor fell silent and did not reply immediately.
 !!
 It looked like a huge opportunity, but it was also a huge danger.
 To make the Formless Transcendent Deity recruit him, the latter had to have enemies of the same realm. There was no way back once he agreed.
 He could only walk this path to the end!
 The Formless Transcendent Deity was not in a hurry. He patiently waited for his reply.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor recalled his past experiences. He had always chosen a strong backing in the past.
 Now, the strongest backing he knew was right in front of him. What was he hesitating about?
 Although Han Jue was the publicly acknowledged strongest in the Chaos, the Evil Heavenly Emperor knew that the person in front of him was even more extraordinary. He did not enter the Chaos and was outside the order.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor took a deep breath and asked, “Senior, what do you want me to do?”
 Previously, when he faced the Formless Transcendent Deity, he did not want to be related. Now that he had joined the camp, he would definitely have to humble himself.
 “I will help you reach the Great Dao Supreme Realm and create a great opportunity like the Chaos. Before that, the Heavenly Court still has to recruit geniuses and accumulate strength,” the Formless Transcendent Deity said slowly, causing the Evil Heavenly Emperor to frown.
 “Don’t worry about Han Huang and the others. What I want is also what Han Jue wants. This matter has to start from the realm above the Great Dao…”
 The Formless Transcendent Deity began to introduce the Dao Creator Realm. The Evil Heavenly Emperor’s expression changed drastically as he listened.
 There was actually such a realm above the Chaos…
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor didn’t even know how big the Chaos was. He was naturally shocked now that he was participating in the creation of the Chaos.
 “So Han Jue has already reached this level… There’s also Laozi, the Dao Ancestor, and the Great Dao World below the Chaos…”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor’s eyes flickered. He finally understood.
 He wanted to overthrow the Lord of Chaos!
 The Formless Transcendent Deity planned to use him as a pawn. If this did not work, he could take the blame. If it succeeded, it would naturally be a great opportunity.
 Splitting the Chaos and taking drastic measures!
 In that case, it was indeed what Han Jue wanted.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor said, “Alright, I’ll do as you say. But Han Huang, Han Qing’er, Jiang Jueshi, Zhao Shuangquan, Azure Heaven Mystic, and the War Buddha can only follow my instructions.”
 The Formless Transcendent Deity said, “The matters of the Heavenly Court are all under your instructions. My only instruction is that if you succeed, the Heavenly Court will be your Great Dao World. The geniuses and immortals will still belong to you.”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor asked carefully, “Could it be that you…”
 “That’s right. I also have a Great Dao World that has existed for countless years. It’s just that it’s obstructed by the Chaos, so you don’t have to worry. I still look down on the geniuses of the Chaos.”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor secretly heaved a sigh of relief at the Formless Transcendent Deity’s answer.
 Another five hundred thousand years passed.
 Han Jue became 15 million years old. The Ultimate Origin Qi in the Ultimate Origin World had already reached 30%. More and more Chaotic Fiendcelestials encountered the Ultimate Origin Qi and used it to cultivate.
 Han Jue’s strength also increased greatly.
 He began the simulation trial and challenged another hundred Nine-Headed Divine Spirits. This time, the Ultimate Origin Soul Oblivion annihilated the enemies in less than a breath of time.
 The Nine-Headed Divine Spirit was no longer Han Jue’s match.
 However, he was still a good whetstone.
 Han Jue next challenged a thousand Nine-Headed Divine Spirits.
 How powerful was the Nine-Headed Divine Spirit? The aura of a thousand of them was enough to crush the entire Chaos. However, the simulation trial’s space was endless. They could fight as they pleased.
 The simulation trial ended less than an hour later.
 Han Jue understood his strength and stopped fighting. He checked his emails next.
 There were still 150,000 years until the Chaotic Assembly. To Han Jue, it was already very close.
 From the emails, it proved this.
 The emails in the past five hundred thousand years were many times more than before. His friends had gone mad!
 After reading the emails, Han Jue stood up and said, “Ling’er, follow me to see your brother.”
 Han Ling, who was cultivating, opened her eyes and immediately stood up.
 The father and daughter disappeared from the Daoist temple.
 Thunderclouds surged and the ground was vast. The half-naked Yi Tian enjoyed the tempering of the lightning.
 A million kilometers away, Han Tuo sat above the endless sea. Strong winds circled around him and his robes fluttered. He really looked like a true god in the sky, insufferably arrogant.
 Han Jue and Han Ling appeared at the distant sea and looked up at Han Tuo.
 Han Ling sighed. “Is that Big Brother? How powerful.”
 She had the Primordial Emperor Star, so her senses were naturally extraordinary. She could sense Han Tuo’s strength. Even she might not win.
 “It’s alright, but it’s still far inferior to your second brother,” Han Jue said softly.
 The conversation between the father and daughter was isolated by the Ultimate Origin Power and was not heard by the Five Great Divine Punishers.
 Han Tuo suddenly opened his eyes and knelt down in front of him. He suppressed his excitement and said, “Greetings, Father!”
 His voice was loud. Yi Tian and the other three Divine Punishers immediately rushed over and bowed to Han Jue.
 Han Jue smiled secretly. This kid dared to play tricks.
 This was a fortuitous encounter for his brothers!
 Han Jue didn’t expose them and smiled. “Get
 up.”
 “Hehe. Senior, I’ve always called myself your godson. You won’t be angry, right? Just accept me. I’m a Chaotic Fiendcelestial, after all. I won’t embarrass you.”
 Yi Tian chuckled and rubbed his hands together.
 Yi Tian’s eyes lit up. He was indeed not confident in the Eternal Peak, but he had to take one of the spots among the Chaotic Ten Absolutes!
 He began to brag. The four Divine Punishers and Han Ling couldn’t help but laugh.
 Han Jue interrupted him and introduced Han Ling to them.
 “It’s indeed Sister Han Ling. I’ve heard about her from Qing’er.”
 Han Tuo was very happy, and the other Divine Punishers were secretly shocked.
 They all knew that Han Tuo had another younger sister. How long had it been? She had actually attained the Great Dao. Furthermore, this aura was definitely not at the early-stage Great Dao Primordial Chaos Realm!
 “Is Sister Ling’er also participating in the Chaotic Assembly?” Yi Tian asked curiously.
 Han Ling smiled and said, “I don’t dare to participate. I don’t like fighting and can’t win against you.”
 The Divine Punishers heaved a sigh of relief.
 They did not believe her. They had been through hundreds of battles and were all Great Dao Sages, but they couldn’t see through Han Ling. What did this mean?


 Han Jue preached the Dao after chatting for a while. The Five Great Divine Punishers were excited and immediately sat in front of him.
 They woke up one after another after a certain period of time. Yi Tian asked in surprise, “Where’s Godfather?”
 Han Tuo said, “He must have left.”
 !!
 He took a deep breath and clenched his fists in his sleeves.
 He could sense his father’s anticipation. He had greater ambitions for the Chaotic Assembly. Previously, he did not dare to think about the Eternal Peak and felt that it should belong to his second brother. But now, he understood what his father meant.
 His father hoped that he would also fight and bring pressure to Han Huang!
 “The Divine Might Heavenly Sage is truly impressive.”
 “Three thousand years of listening to the Dao is better than millions of years of cultivation.”
 “Brother, it seems that the Divine Might Heavenly Sage also thinks highly of you. You have to perform well.”
 “Haha, the Eternal Peak is mine!”
 Han Tuo smiled upon hearing his brothers’ words. He felt extremely happy. He had a father who thought highly of him and brothers who lived and died with him. If he did not obtain an excellent ranking, he would be letting down the people he cared about!
 Third Dao Field.
 Han Ling asked curiously, “Father, aren’t you going to find Second Brother and Third Sister?”
 Han Jue said, “Your second brother no longer needs my guidance. As for Qing’er, forget it. She will at most join in the fun. I don’t want to give her hope.”
 Han Qing’er was only at the Freedom Realm now. It was impossible for her to have a good ranking in the Chaotic Assembly.
 Freedom Sages were not as rare nowadays.
 Han Ling blinked and was touched.
 From the sound of it, her father really doted on her.
 Look at her third sister…
 Han Ling couldn’t help but pity Han Qing’er.
 Han Jue closed his eyes. Han Ling didn’t ask anymore and started cultivating.
 Han Jue didn’t cultivate but sent a dream to Han Qing’er.
 After all, she was his daughter and used to be his favorite. Han Jue still had to care about her and teach her a Mystical Power.
 Han Qing’er was very excited and chatted with him for a while. Compared to Han Ling, Han Qing’er was even more carefree and was the closest to Han Jue.
 The dream lasted for a long time.
 Han Jue visited Han Huang and Jiang Jueshi next. He didn’t teach them any Mystical Powers and only encouraged them.
 At the bottom of the Chaos.
 Ten Absolute City was extremely vast. It occupied an area larger than the entire Immortal World. There was an area inside that was the gathering place for teleportation arrays. Currently, more than a hundred million teleportation arrays had been built, and many living beings were still building more of them.
 After ten million years of publicity, the Chaotic Assembly had yet to begin, but it was already enough to establish its legendary status. This would be an unprecedented event in the Chaos.
 Currently, the people guarding Ten Absolute City were all Great Dao Divine Spirits. The order was strict.
 The Ultimate God of Punishment had already given the order that nothing could happen to the Ten Absolute City. He valued this Chaotic Assembly greatly.
 The Chaotic Assembly was no longer a stage for geniuses. It was also a game of forces and a banquet.
 If one could dig up the Chaotic Ten Absolutes, he would find a Great Dao Divine Spirit.
 Apart from the Chaotic Ten Absolutes, there were the Hundred Sovereigns, Thousand Lords, and Ten Thousand Strong. Their names would definitely shake the Chaos as long as they entered the top ten thousand. The top ten thousand were also geniuses that the various factions yearned for.
 In the blink of an eye.
 Han Jue entered seclusion for another 150,000 years, and the Chaotic Assembly would begin in a hundred years.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and asked, “Ling’er, are you ready?”
 Han Ling immediately opened her eyes; they were filled with anticipation.
 The father and daughter walked out of the Dao Field and found Xing Hongxuan and the other two women. This Chaotic Assembly had created history, so he naturally had to bring his women along. However, he had to leave a wisp of his soul in the Dao Field before leaving
 He could still revive if something happened.
 No matter who it was, as long as Han Jue might die, he would abandon them. He thought so, but if the people around him knew or experienced it personally, they would definitely be heartbroken. Therefore, he had to avoid such a situation.
 Han Jue never liked to take risks.
 At the same time, at the bottom of the Chaos.
 The huge Ten Absolute City was extremely lively. Every street was crowded. There were many living beings, pets, mounts, and so on above the city.
 “Extreme North Domain, Great Heavenly God King has arrived!” a cultivator standing above a black dragon shouted. His voice resounded throughout the entire Ten Absolute City, causing countless living beings to be in an uproar.
 Clearly, this Great Heavenly God King was very famous.
 “Tsk tsk, the Great Heavenly God King is indeed here. I thought he was not qualified.”
 “Hahaha, the Great Heavenly God King is probably close to a hundred million years old.”
 cars
 “The Great Heavenly God King is considered a powerful prodigy, right?”
 “Definitely. After all, he has been famous for a long time.”
 “Too many peerless geniuses have appeared in the past thousand years. In the past, I felt that the top ten thousand would definitely be mixed with nameless people. Now, it seems that it’s very difficult to enter the top ten thousand.”
 “Can I, the Primordial Chaos Sage, enter the top ten thousand?”
 Such announcements had already happened for the last ten thousand years, stirring the atmosphere of the Chaotic Assembly to the extreme. This was arranged by the Ultimate God of Punishment. The goal was to make the geniuses more famous and make the Chaotic Assembly mysterious.
 As the experiences of many geniuses spread, not to mention the Eternal Peak, even the top hundred in the Chaos could not be predicted.
 Several hours later.
 “Great Dao Tower, Zhou Fan has arrived!”
 ca
 The Great Dao Tower had been too low profile in the past few million years.
 At the same time, in a vast courtyard, many Hidden Sect disciples had already gathered.
 The Black Hell Chicken shouted, “Dog, go fetch your Brother Fan!”
 The Chaotic Heavenly Dog was unhappy and cursed. “Why is it always me? Why aren’t you, Brother Chicken, going?”
 “You’ve already said, ‘Brother Chicken’. As your brother, I can’t run errands!”
 “You!”
 Guan Bubai glanced at the Chaotic Heavenly Dog and snorted. “Hurry up and go!”
 The others also began to urge the Chaotic Heavenly Dog
 The Chaotic Heavenly Dog was furious and could only rush over to fetch him.
 Great Loose Heaven suddenly asked, “Where’s Murong Qi? Why isn’t he here yet?”
 The Black Hell Chicken smiled. “Eternal Peak? How dare he think that? Isn’t this our Junior Huang’s position?”


 Guan Bubai smiled proudly, causing everyone to roll their eyes.
 The Black Hell Chicken looked at Han Ming and asked, “What about you? What’s your goal? Where have you been all these years?”
 !!
 fun.”
 Everyone smiled and did not think too much about it. After all, Han Ming had never been outstanding in the second Dao Field.
 Chang Yue’er curled her lips. “Why isn’t Junior Han with us?”
 Fairy Xi Xuan pulled her. “What are you saying? He’s already the Divine Might Heavenly Sage. He definitely can’t stay with us. He must be plotting something related to the Chaotic Assembly with someone.”
 The others also chatted about this matter. The reason why the Chaotic Assembly could have such an effect was because of the Divine Might Heavenly Sage’s influence. The strongest in the Chaos had a fatal appeal to geniuses.
 If it was not the event hosted by the strongest, the geniuses would more or less feel disdain.
 Soon, Zhou Fan brought his son and Mo Fuchou over. The Chaotic Heavenly Dog was nowhere to be found.
 “Zhou Fan, where’s my dog son?” the Black Hell Chicken asked with a dissatisfied tone.
 Zhou Fan smiled. “He went to fetch the others. Long Hao is here, but he’s not famous, so there’s no city guard announcement. Haha.”
 Chang Yue’er stared at Mo Fuchou and exclaimed, “Senior Mo! Why are you still alive?”
 Mo Fuchou was stunned when he saw Chang Yue’er and Fairy Xi Xuan. He felt that things had changed.
 Old friends naturally had to chat when they met.
 Everyone chatted in groups. Although they were from the same sect, there were differences in their relationship.
 On the other side.
 Han Jue was not busy. Instead, he brought his wives and daughter around the city and did not expose his identity.
 The order of Ten Absolute City was extremely good. There was no bullying. There were all sorts of shops and stalls. If not for the fact that he could sense the cultivations of the passersby, Han Jue would have thought that he had returned to the mortal world.
 The things bought in the shops here were all Immortal, Sage, and even Chaotic Numinous Treasures. These were Dharma treasures that even the Great Dao Sages could use.
 Xing Hongxuan, Xuan Qingjun, Qingluan’er, Li Yao, Dao Comprehension Sword, Han Qing’er, and Han Ling surrounded him. They attracted a lot of attention, but it was not rare. Many mighty figures liked this.
 Han Qing’er was extremely lively. She pulled Dao Comprehension Sword and jumped around. She didn’t have the image of an expert at all.
 The other women chatted as they walked, but Han Ling followed behind Han Jue.
 “Divine Punisher, Han Tuo arrives!”
 “Divine Punisher, Yi Tian is here!”
 “Divine Punisher, Chi Fa has arrived!”
 Qingluan’er’s eyes lit up. She looked at Han Jue and said, “Tuo’er is here.”
 Han Jue nodded. “There will be many opportunities to see him later.”
 Qingluan’er nodded.
 Han Qing’er said, “Ignore Big Brother. He has brothers. That’s enough.”
 She was quite jealous. Something had probably happened before.
 Year after year passed.
 It was getting closer and closer to the Chaotic Assembly.
 In the year that it began, Han Jue left with his two daughters. Xing Hongxuan and the others met up with the personal disciples of the Hidden Sect to watch the battles together.
 Han Jue wanted to bring Han Ling along, but Han Qing’er was too passionate. He was too embarrassed to chase her away, so he brought her along
 Above Ten Absolute City, in deep space, an extremely bright palace sat here. Tens of thousands of figures gathered here. The weakest was at the Freedom Realm.
 There was a mat in the hall for these mighty figures to sit on. Other than their cultivation levels, they also had great providence and territory.
 The Great Dao Divine Spirits were also among them. The atmosphere was lively as they chatted.
 Until the Ultimate God of Punishment appeared.
 Above the hall were two huge thrones placed side by side. The Ultimate God of Punishment landed on one of them.
 The moment he appeared, everyone quietened down and looked at him in reverence.
 Han Jue also appeared not long after. His two daughters sat beside him.
 Everyone present was a mighty figure. Other than seeing that Han Jue looked like the two women, they could also sense that their bloodline auras were similar, so they didn’t think too much.
 They remembered Han Qing’er’s and Han Ling’s faces. They had to curry favor with the daughters of the Divine Might Heavenly Sage in the future.
 The Ultimate God of Punishment nodded slightly at him and said, “There’s still a year until the Chaotic Assembly. Everyone, continue chatting. Other than letting the geniuses familiarize themselves with the Chaotic Assembly, we also let the various factions in the Chaos familiarize themselves. We need to get used to the peaceful situation.”
 All the mighty figures thanked him.
 “Sister, are you nervous?”
 “It’s fine.”
 “That’s true. You’re also a Great Dao Sage. I’m really envious.”
 “Sister will be there soon.”
 She clearly had a strong personality, but she hid it and did not let anyone know. She was very similar to him.
 However, Han Qing’er was reckless and did not know the immensity of heaven and earth.
 Han Jue was not worried about her with her two brothers and fellow disciples around.
 It was fine as long as she had fun.
 In the following year, there were several city-wide announcements every day.
 Soon, Huang Zuntian, Han Huang, Murong Qi, Dao Sovereign, Zhao Xuanyuan, Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial, Azure Heaven Mystic, Zhao Shuangquan, and the others arrived.
 Han Huang’s arrival caused the mighty figures to discuss. He was born as Freedom and was the War God of the Heavenly Court. He was famous.
 They deliberately said good things to flatter him.
 Li Daokong looked up at Han Jue, thinking about something
 The Ultimate God of Punishment suddenly smiled and said, “Han Huang can indeed fight for the Eternal Peak, but it won’t be easy. Another prodigy is also extremely outstanding. He admires you, Heavenly Sage.”
 Han Jue smiled and asked, “Oh? Who?”
 The moment the two big shots spoke, all the mighty figures quietened down and listened carefully.
 The Ultimate God of Punishment smiled and said, “It’s Formless World from the Fallen God Domain. He has cultivated for 80 million years and has long surpassed the Great Dao Sage Realm. He has cultivated a great Mystical Power that contains the profundities of the three thousand Great Dao.”
 Never heard of him.
 Han Jue ridiculed in his mind and smiled. “That’s interesting. The more such geniuses there are, the better. I hope a third person who can fight for the Eternal Peak appears.”
 Below, the mighty figure who represented the Fallen God Domain smiled. The nearby mighty figures looked at him with envy.
 The Ultimate God of Punishment began to introduce the rest to Han Jue. It was actually a show to tell the mighty figures below that he was paying attention to the prodigies they were proud of. It could be considered winning the hearts of the people.
 Just like that. The day of the Chaotic Assembly quickly arrived.


 “The Chaotic Assembly is about to begin. All geniuses who want to participate in the Chaotic Assembly, please wait in front of any city!”
 Han Jue sent Han Qing’er to Han Huang’s side.
 The mighty figures below became nervous. They were very curious about the rules of the Chaotic Assembly.
 !!
 This event had been prepared for ten million years. There were countless theories regarding its rules, but the Ultimate God of Punishment and the Divine Might Heavenly Sage had never determined it.
 A huge screen of light appeared in front of Han Jue and the Ultimate God of Punishment. It reflected a world. This world was vast and silent. At a glance, the wasteland was undulating and there was no life at all.
 The mighty figures discussed it. Could this be the first stage of the Chaotic Assembly?
 At the same time, such a screen of light appeared above the various city gates of Ten Absolute City. The desolate world reflected in it attracted the discussion of countless geniuses.
 The Five Great Divine Punishers, Han Huang, Jiang Jueshi, Han Qing’er, Chu Shiren, Murong Qi, the Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial, Qin Ling, Han Yu, the Black Hell Chicken, and so on gathered in front of a city.
 The Black Hell Chicken suddenly said, “Could it be that every city gate is a trial area? Will there be internal strife if we all squeeze together?”
 The others frowned.
 They knew the Hidden Sect’s strength the best. They would not be able to withstand it if they really fought in the first round.
 “Probably not. Look at the illusions on the city gate. Besides, Grandmaster didn’t remind us when we gathered.” Murong Qi shook his head.
 The others felt that it made sense and nodded.
 Zhao Shuangquan and Azure Heaven Mystic stood not far away. They looked at the lineup of the Hidden Sect and were secretly shocked.
 They knew that the Hidden Sect had a strong foundation, but they didn’t expect it to be so terrifying. There were no less than twenty Great Dao Sages.
 Han Huang was also very surprised, but he did not show it.
 The Black Hell Chicken came over and stood behind him. “In any case, I’ll follow Han Huang. Do as you wish!”
 Han Huang smiled and said, “Alright, I’ll protect you as long as the rules allow it, Master Chicken!”
 Guan Bubai snorted. “Junior Huang, the Eternal Peak isn’t yours. I won’t give in to
 you.”
 The other Fiendcelestials shouted.
 Jiang Yi said angrily, “What are you pretending for? The three of us haven’t even spoken. Be careful not to encounter us in the top ten thousand and be directly eliminated!”
 Zhao Xuanyuan also smiled proudly.
 The Hidden Sect had many people, so it naturally attracted the attention of the other geniuses nearby. Seeing them posture like this, although the geniuses were unhappy, they did not dare to show themselves.
 At this moment, the voice of the Ultimate God of Punishment resounded throughout the city.
 “First stage of the Chaotic Assembly, Devil Trampling Road!
 “What you see is the Resentful Devil Prison at the bottom of the Chaos. All of you will be teleported to the edge of the Resentful Devil Prison. You will reach the center of the prison in a month. You’ll be considered to have passed after passing the teleportation formation and returning to the Ten Absolute City. There is no limit to the number of people who can pass.
 “Prodigies can use any schemes and methods. As long as you clear the level. I’ll remind you. The closer you are to the center of the Resentful Devil Prison, the more Resentful Devils there are. Their cultivation levels will also constantly increase. We won’t stop even if there are casualties!
 “In two hours, all the geniuses who stay in front of the city gate will be teleported to the Devil Trampling Road. You still have time to leave!”
 Countless geniuses began to discuss.
 The weakest person present was a Primordial Chaos Sage. They all had life-saving methods. They had a way to revive even if they died on the Devil Trampling Road.
 In the hall.
 The mighty figures also chatted about the Devil Trampling Road.
 “This rule is not bad. It’s a good opportunity to let the geniuses know that the Chaos is not absolutely peaceful.”
 “The first round is interesting. I wonder how many rounds there are.”
 “What if less than ten thousand people pass?”
 “Don’t worry. Don’t underestimate the prodigies. We definitely won’t be able to decide the top ten thousand in this stage.”
 Han Ling also began to talk to her father in a low voice. She was very interested in the Resentful Devils.
 Han Jue smiled and said, “Do you regret it? You could have participated.”
 “Not really.”
 Han Ling shook her head firmly.
 The Ultimate God of Punishment glanced at her and was secretly curious.
 He thought of Han Jue and suddenly understood something.
 This was really his master.
 He would never reveal his trump cards.
 Two hours passed quickly. A light appeared in front of more than a hundred city gates in Ten Absolute City. All the geniuses disappeared and were sent into the Resentful Devil Prison by the Ultimate God of Punishment.
 The first round of the Chaotic Assembly had begun!
 The geniuses of the Heavenly Dao and the Hidden Sect landed someplace in the Resentful Devil Prison. To be precise, the geniuses in front of every city gate landed together.
 They were all geniuses, so they naturally would not shout. The scene was a little strange.
 They all knew that they couldn’t do this alone. The more people there were, the safer it was.
 Dao Sovereign flew up and shouted, “Heavenly Dao, Hidden Sect, follow me!”
 This team contained dozens of Great Dao Sages, giving the other geniuses immense pressure.
 “As expected of the Hidden Sect of the Divine Might Heavenly Sage. How powerful.”
 “Even the Divine Punishers are following.”
 “Nonsense. Don’t you know that the leader of the Divine Punishers is the Divine Might Heavenly Sage’s biological son?”.
 “This lineup… the Hidden Sect is actually so strong. Even I want to join it.”
 “Haha, don’t talk nonsense. A mighty figure must be paying attention outside. Your elders might be angry.”
 For a time, the other geniuses also began to advance in groups.
 A few cultivators chose to fight alone. As they advanced, the atmosphere of the Heavenly Dao and Hidden Sect was cheerful. They chatted with each other and did not feel any pressure.
 Even the most stable Fang Liang and Chu Shiren were relaxed.
 Nothing could happen with so many fellow disciples moving together!
 Han Qing’er was the most excited. She pulled Han Tuo with her left hand and Han Huang with her right hand, chattering non-stop.
 The two brothers doted on this younger sister.
 Han Tuo suddenly looked at Han Huang and asked with a smile, “Second Brother, how confident are you about the Eternal Peak?”
 Amused, Han Tuo also smiled. “Of course. However, don’t let your guard down. I won’t let you win so easily.”
 Yi Tian came over and laughed. “Han Huang, not to mention your brother, your greatest opponent is me!”
 Behind them, Chu Shiren stared at Han Huang’s back. It was unknown what he was thinking
 Murong Qi and Fang Liang approached him. Murong Qi smiled and asked, “What? You have ambitions too?”
