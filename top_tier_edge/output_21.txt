 Jie Yin said, “The Deity Realm of the Ruins of End is destroyed. We Great Dao Sages now wander and can’t obtain the help of the gods. We can’t help them.”
 The black shadow was silent.
 Jie Yin’s expression was normal. He was not afraid of offending the other party.
 He was a Great Dao Sage, after all. He only gave the other party face because he was worried about the Chaotic Deities.
 In his circle, there were other Great Dao Divine Spirits, but they were not as strong as this fellow. Their backgrounds were also inferior.
 The black shadow snorted. “Why are you still standing here?”
  Jie Yin bowed and left. Two steps later, he disappeared.
 The black shadow disappeared and the hall fell silent.
 Five hundred years later.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and a notification appeared.
 [The Dao Field has been upgraded. The array formation has been raised to the level of a Dao Creator. The space inside the Dao Field has been expanded.)
 [The Dao Field can block all prying eyes.]
 Dao Creator level!
 He had already reached the strongest limit!
 All prying eyes could be blocked!
 Han Jue asked in his mind, “Can the Chaotic Consciousness barge into the Dao Field?”
 (1 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 (Can’t barge in for the time being.)
 Han Jue frowned. It seemed that he was thinking too much.
 But it was enough for a short time.
 Han Jue took out two Creation Spirit Stones and entered the Primordial World in the depths of his soul. He began to choose the Chaotic Fiendcelestials.
 After hesitating for a long time, he finally chose the Traversal Fiendcelestial and the Fog Fiendcelestial.
 The Traversal Fiendcelestial could be an intelligence spy in the future. The Fog Fiendcelestial could help cover the second Dao Field.
 After the two Creation Spirit Stones fused with the Fiendcelestial Qi, Han Jue looked at the Great Dao Fragment and the Heavenly Dao Spirit Stone.
 This time, he still had to choose a sealing method to throw targets into the Primordial Heavenly Prison.
 As for the Heavenly Dao Spirit Stone, he was a little hesitant to upgrade the Book of Misfortune again.
 It was very difficult to obtain a Dharma treasure that surpassed the Great Dao Realm. The system’s choices also decreased.
 Although the Book of Misfortune was strong, it had rarely cursed an enemy to death when facing a Great Dao Sage. It would even give the Curse Fiendcelestial a chance to rope in forces.
 Han Jue considered the Killing Dao Token and the Heaven-Opening Axe.
 One day, he would have to personally walk through the chaos. The image of Pan Xin lingered in his mind.
 Forget it, he would preach the Dao first.
 It had been many years.
 Han Jue thought.
 Buzhou Divine Mountain.
 At the top of the mountain, Han Yu stood by the cliff and looked down at the majestic mountain range. His gaze followed a figure. The figure rode the clouds above the mountains. He flipped around and his speed was extremely fast, like a swan.
 Han Yu looked satisfied.
 In the past, when he took in Tian Yong as his disciple, he was already pleasantly surprised. However, when he taught Qin Ling, he finally understood what the true joy of education was.
 No matter what he taught, Qin Ling learned it in one go. Not only that, but Qin Ling was also very obedient and liked to pester him, unlike Tian Yong, who always had his own thoughts.
 Now, Han Yu and Qin Ling were more like father and son.
 After Qin Ling’s mother died, he treated Han Yu as the most important person and his only family.
 Speaking of this, Qin Ling was also very sad back then. However, ever since he went to the netherworld and learned that his father had long died, he told his mother about this. His mother no longer wanted to live.
 Without cultivation potential, even if she extended her life, it would only increase her loneliness.
 Han Yu had taught him that everyone had their own fate. Not everyone wanted to live forever.
 Without the ties of mortals, Qin Ling cultivated even more attentively and his cultivation level increased rapidly.
 Han Yu suddenly sent a voice transmission to him.
 Qin Ling came in front of him.
 “Grandmaster!” Qin Ling smiled. In front of Han Yu, he was always a child.
 Han Yu smiled kindly and said, “Now, Grandmaster no longer has anything to teach you. You’ve really grown up.”
 Qin Ling smiled. “What are you saying? Cultivating with Grandmaster is cultivation in itself.”
 Han Yu shook his head and laughed. “Actually, I’ve always had a goal in my heart that I’m unwilling to accept. That is to surpass my heartless ancestor. However, I’ve asked my master before. The difference between us is getting greater and greater. It’s probably wishful thinking to want to surpass him.”
 Qin Ling was surprised.
 Han Yu’s master was a Sage. Han Yu was also a mighty figure in the world. To be able to obtain the evaluation of a Sage, how strong was Han Yu’s ancestor?
 Qin Ling asked, “Is that senior a Sage?”
 Facing Han Yu’s ancestor, he had to use honorifics and not mess up his seniority.
 Then, he slowly told him the story of the Han family. Qin Ling listened carefully. As he listened, Qin Ling felt heartache.
 He could imagine the despair Han Yu felt when the Han family was slaughtered and he asked his ancestor for help.
 Any mighty figure had experienced unimaginable hardship.
 After Han Yu finished speaking, Qin Ling suddenly asked curiously, “Who is your ancestor’s ancestor? He must be a Sage, right?”
 Han Yu restrained his emotions and smiled. “I wanted to tell you about this. I want to send you to the Hidden Sect to cultivate.”
 “The Hidden Sect?”
 Qin Ling was stunned. He had naturally heard of the Hidden Sect.
 The most mysterious and powerful force in the Immortal World!
 “Wait, could it be that your ancestor’s ancestor is in the Hidden Sect?” Qin Ling asked, his breathing quickened.
 Back at the Human Race’s Ten Thousand Dynasty Pilgrimage Ceremony, he had heard many legends about the Hidden Sect. Many of the geniuses ranked higher than him were also from this sect.
 The number of geniuses in the Hidden Sect was the highest among the Sage Sects!
 Han Yu smiled and nodded.
 Qin Ling’s shocked expression pleased him.
  “Then, will you enter the Hidden Sect with me?” Qin Ling frowned and asked.
 Qin Ling thought for a moment and finally nodded.
 Recently, he indeed felt that his cultivation speed was not good!
 It wasn’t only the Buzhou Divine Mountain. Such a situation was happening everywhere in the Immortal World. The news of the increase in the Spirit Qi in the Hundred Peak Immortal River had already reached Li Xuan’ao’s ears through the Myriad Worlds Projection. Li Xuan’ao began to plan to attract a group of top geniuses in the world to cultivate in the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 He was confident that as long as they stayed in the Hundred Peak Immortal River for a period of time, they would never leave.
 To cultivators, cultivation speed was their greatest pursuit!


 It was extremely domineering!
 Han Jue began the simulation trial and imprisoned Ancestor Xitian with a palm!
 If it hit, the target would freeze!
 It’s too powerful!
 Han Jue was extremely excited. He continued the simulation trial and used his new Mystical Power to defeat Ancestor Xitian.
  Two hours later, Han Jue began to improve his Sword Dao Mystical Powers. After that, he cultivated the Grand Unity Aspect.
 In the blink of an eye, seventy years passed.
 Han Jue had learned 150 new Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols this time. The number far exceeded the previous times!
 Some powerful Great Dao also appeared among the 150 Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols.
 For example, the Space Fiendcelestial, the Rewind Fiendcelestial, the Lone Fiendcelestial, and so on.
 As the name suggested, the Space Fiendcelestial controlled the power of space. Since ancient times, there had been a legend of the three thousand Great Dao. Time was king and Space was emperor.
 Of course, this was only a prejudice, but it was enough to show how powerful the Great Dao of Time and Space were.
 The Rewind Fiendcelestial could reverse everything that happened. Even if he died, he could return to his previous state. It was similar to the Great Dao of Time. However, if time was erased, the Rewind Fiendcelestial could also reverse it. It could be said to be a match made in heaven with the Great Dao of Time.
 The strength of the Lone Fiendcelestial was related to the number of Chaotic Fiendcelestials. The fewer Chaotic Fiendcelestials there were, the stronger he was. For this, he had to try his best to eliminate them.
 Other Chaotic Fiendcelestials also had their own uses.
 Currently, Han Jue already controlled 549 Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols!
 He entered the simulation trial and mastered his skills.
 Every Great Dao Sage was not Han Jue’s match in a one-on-one battle!
 He had the talent to cross realms and kill enemies. The Grand Unity Aspect and the new Great Dao Mystical Power would only widen the gap between him and his peers.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and moved Li Xuan’ao in from the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 Li Xuan’ao opened his eyes and heaved a sigh of relief when he saw that he had already arrived at Han Jue’s Daoist temple.
 He had brought a group of geniuses and waited outside for more than ten years. The pressure was too great, and the geniuses were a little dissatisfied.
 The personal disciples didn’t dare to disturb Han Jue. They knew that even if he was cultivating, he could also sense the situation outside. There must be a reason why he left Li Xuan’ao and the others alone.
 Little did they know that Han Jue had only focused on cultivation and had indeed neglected Li Xuan’ao.
 Li Xuan’ao bowed respectfully and explained his intentions.
 Han Jue used his Sage Sense to scan the area. After confirming that there was nothing abnormal with the geniuses, he agreed to Li Xuan’ao’s arrangements and directly moved them in, letting Li Xuan’ao make the arrangements himself.
 Li Xuan’ao thanked him excitedly and left.
 He had brought thirty-seven geniuses this time. All of them had outstanding potential. A few had even awakened the Chaotic Physique and entered the Chaotic Domain.
 He noticed that among this group of geniuses was Han Yu’s grand-disciple, Qin Ling.
 This kid had actually reached the Rank Eight Immortal Emperor Realm!
 His breakthrough speed was indeed fast!
 Han Jue only glanced at Qin Ling and had no intention of opening a back door for him.
 The current him was already a Great Dao Sage. The prodigies were nothing in front of him.
 Which of his enemies did not have heaven-defying talent and providence to reach their current heights?
 Han Jue went to the second Dao Field.
  After the Spirit Qi in the main Dao Field transformed, the second Dao Field was the same. The fiendcelestials were still cultivating and Han Jue didn’t disturb them.
 Guan Bubai was already at the mid-stage Pseudo-Sage Realm. After reaching the perfected Pseudo-Sage Realm, Han Jue would replace his Chaotic Fiendcelestial bloodline.
 He thought for a moment and sent a voice transmission to Great Loose Heaven to let him enter the temple.
 Great Loose Heaven was excited when he heard his voice.
 Great Loose Heaven was anxious and had long wanted to attain the Dao, so he wanted to ask Han Jue for guidance.
 After entering the temple, Han Jue sized up Great Loose Heaven and was in no hurry to speak.
 The atmosphere was silent.
 After a long time.
 Great Loose Heaven suddenly kowtowed and gritted his teeth. “Sect Master, I want to attain the Dao!”
 In front of attaining the Dao, he could no longer care about his dignity!
 Han Jue smiled. “With the potential of the Chaotic Fiendcelestial, you will attain the Dao sooner or later. You don’t have to be anxious.”
 Great Loose Heaven was silent, but he looked unwilling.
 Han Jue asked, “What do you want to do after attaining the Dao?”
 Great Loose Heaven was stunned. “I want the other Sages regret it!”
 A Sage had promised him a Sage position, but he had been intercepted. He would be furious every time he thought of this.
 During that period of time, he could be said to be the joke of the entire Immortal World.
 From Pseudo-Sages to mortals who had just ascended, everyone knew that he had been played by a Sage. Even a Pseudo-Sage wouldn’t be able to withstand such humiliation.
 “Great Loose Heaven, are you cultivating for yourself or for others?” Han Jue asked casually
 Great Loose Heaven replied, “Of course it’s for myself. It’s just that I can slap their faces in passing. That’s the best.”
 Han Jue said meaningfully, “You want to slap the Sages in the face today, but what about the next day? True mighty figures won’t reveal their cultivation unless it’s necessary. Take me, for example. Before I attained the Dao, have you heard of me? After I attained the Dao, how many things have you heard of me? Those who love fame and fortune will only fall deeper and deeper. I stay away from trouble and cultivate in peace. I’ve already surpassed the Sages.”
 Great Loose Heaven felt ashamed.
 After all, he was someone who had experienced many things. He could listen to Han Jue’s lecture based on his own experience.
 Of course, if it was someone with a lower cultivation level than him, he would only scoff and even fly into a rage out of humiliation.
 “After you attain the Dao, I won’t let you out either. The Sage Realm might be strong in the Heavenly Dao, but it’s not enough in the Chaos. You have to cultivate here in peace in the future, understand?” Han Jue said earnestly.
 Han Jue’s situation made Great Loose Heaven ashamed.
 He pursued the Sage Realm, but Han Jue treated it like an ant.
 “Alright, it’s time to help you attain the Dao.” Han Jue suddenly smiled.
 Great Loose Heaven was stunned and then pleasantly surprised. He hurriedly kowtowed.
 He thought that Han Jue was going to reject him. He didn’t expect him to really use his conscience. His respect for Han Jue instantly reached the extreme.
  He had followed the right person!
 Han Jue directly used the Great Dao of Extreme Origin to cover Great Loose Heaven.
 After attaining the Great Dao, Han Jue’s Great Dao of Extreme Origin had already transformed. The vastness of the Dao made the Pseudo-Sage Great Loose Heaven fall into it. His soul was in an extremely sublime state.
 A hundred years passed.
 Han Jue ended his lecture and walked out of the Daoist temple.
 Great Loose Heaven had already obtained the method to attain the Dao, but if he wanted to do it, he still needed to cultivate alone.
 His eyes were filled with confidence.
 He was confident that he could attain the Dao in five thousand years!


 As the Earth Immortal World and the Immortal World were connected, the cultivation atmosphere also increased significantly. The Reincarnation Space distributed a large number of cultivation resources to the Reincarnators. As the top Reincarnators, Ren Gang and Yin Hongchen enjoyed the most.
 The two of them had been having a hard time recently. More and more cultivators from the Immortal World had arrived, and there was no lack of factions and families among them. Conflicts naturally erupted.
 In the Immortal World, cultivators would still worry about Sages, but not in the Earth Immortal World. They didn’t know which Sage controlled the Earth Immortal World.
 When the Sages saw this situation, they turned a blind eye. If they suppressed the conflict too much, it would only intensify it. It was also a good thing to have a place to vent.
  Han Jue sent a dream to Ren Gang and Yin Hongchen, wanting to ask if they were prepared to give up their freedom.
 In the end, after struggling, the two of them chose to wait.
 They had not given up. They wanted to see how far they could go by themselves.
 Han Jue also chose to respect their decision. He wasn’t in a hurry.
 Only by achieving great enlightenment could they truly cultivate diligently. Otherwise, even if Han Jue forcefully brought them to the second Dao Field, they would be impetuous and develop mental demons.
 As his cultivation level increased, Han Jue’s mental state gradually relaxed. In the past, he was only afraid that his disciples would cause trouble for him. Now, if a disciple asked to go out, he wouldn’t strictly stop them.
 However, no personal disciple went out recently. They might have gotten used to staying in the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 Han Jue returned to the Hundred Peak Immortal River and happened to see Li Xuan’ao waiting in front of the Daoist temple. He prepared to go out again.
 Han Jue sent him out with a thought.
 Although this was troublesome, it was at least safe. Han Jue couldn’t give the disciples free access. It would be over if the enemy infiltrated one day.
 The higher his cultivation level, the more careful Han Jue had to be.
 Experts always failed miserably after getting overconfident.
 Han Jue perked up and continued cultivating.
 Han Jue was now the only Great Dao Sage in the Heavenly Dao!
 Outside the 33rd Heaven, in the Pangu Hall.
 Pan Xin sat on his mat and heaved a sigh of relief. His brows were filled with exhaustion.
 Not long after, Jin Shen and Emperor Xiao arrived.
 The two of them bowed to Pan Xin. He waved his hand and gestured for them to sit down.
 “This trip to the Chaos can be considered to have established a great backer. In the future, it will be convenient for you to travel through the Chaos, but it can only be considered convenient. The Chaotic Order is chaotic, so you still have to be extremely careful,” Pan Xin said.
 Jin Shen and Emperor Xiao were very happy.
 It was already the consensus of the Heavenly Dao to head to the Chaos. Although the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End had repeatedly invaded the Heavenly Dao, it did not represent the entire Chaos. The Chaos was enormous, and the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End was only a small corner.
 The two Sages noticed that Pan Xin was not very joyful.
 Emperor Xiao asked, “What happened?”
 Great Dao Sage! Emperor Xiao and Jin Shen were shocked. They knew that above the Heavenly Dao Sage Realm was the Freedom Sage Realm. Above that was the Great Dao Sage Realm.
 Pan Xin had already begun to touch that realm?
 He was truly an invincible existence in the Heavenly Dao!
 Emperor Xiao narrowed his eyes and asked, “The other Sages want to open a Dao Field at the end of the Chaotic Heavenly Road. Do you agree?”
 Pan Xin snorted. “Why? Aren’t the Immortal World and the myriad worlds enough for them? Reject them all! They don’t even dare to use their true bodies to go. If they agree, we will have to take care of their Dao Fields in the future.”
 He had already experienced the shamelessness of Sages. If he agreed today, the Sages would make more requests tomorrow and use all sorts of reasons and logic to make him speechless.
 Pan Xin also wanted to salvage his image now and did not want to be as unreasonable as before. He didn’t have the bearing of a mighty figure, but in terms of words, he was really inferior to those Sages.
 Emperor Xiao nodded.
 Jin Shen glanced at him, thinking about something
 Five thousand years passed.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and looked puzzled.
 Could it be that he had created the Great Dao of Extreme Origin and in a sense, could be considered a Great Dao Sage?
 This was the only explanation.
 Comprehending the Dao seemed to be meditation, but it was actually helping the Great Dao develop. No matter what his thoughts were, the Great Dao would develop in that direction.
 Han Jue stopped thinking and checked the emails.
 (Your good friend Evil Heavenly Emperor has received guidance from a mysterious mighty figure. His cultivation has increased greatly.]
 [Your good friend Great Loose Heaven used his strength to attain the Dao and obtained the Primordial Chaos Dao Fruit.]
 (Your grand-disciple Fang Liang received a dream from the Dao Ancestor.]
 (Your disciple Zhou Fan received your enemy Seven Dao Sage’s dream.]
 [Your disciple Yang Tiandong has entered the Dark Forbidden Zone.]
 (Your good friend Divine Lord Peacock was attacked by your enemy, the Curse Fiendcelestial.]
 (Your enemy, the Curse Fiendcelestial, was attacked by your good friend Divine Lord Peacock. He was severely injured and only had a remnant soul left.]
 [Your good friend Empress Houtu was attacked by your enemy, Fuxitian.)
 Great Loose Heaven successfully attained the Dao. It was as Han Jue had expected.
 Divine Lord Peacock gave him a surprise.
 This fellow was really persistent in chasing after the Curse Fiendcelestial.
 Further down, Empress Houtu and Fuxitian fought. Han Jue felt that this was only a superficial sight. It might be a collision of two forces.
 The Ancestral Magi should not be considered a Deity Realm of the Ruins of End force. They might be taking revenge.
 Speaking of which, the tragic state of the Magi indeed had the Sages to blame.
 Why could the demons still do so well while the Magi could not?
 They could only blame the Magus Race for not having a Sage back then. Empress Houtu was only a Reincarnation Sage and was far inferior to a Heavenly Dao Sage.
 Behind the demons were Nüwa and Fuxitian.
 Han Jue continued reading with relish.
  At least he did not feel threatened.
 At this moment…
 A line of words suddenly appeared in front of him.
 [Detected that you are being erased by a mysterious force. Do you want to head to the Chaotic River of Destiny to stop it?]
 [If you go, the system will protect your karma and prevent you from being attacked by forces outside the Chaotic River of Destiny.]
 Han Jue frowned. What did this mean?
 “What happens if I don’t go?”
 [The past will be erased. Your disciples, relatives, and everyone who knows you will forget your existence.]


 “If I go, can I defeat the other party?” Han Jue asked in his mind.
 (200 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 (Yes]
 Han Jue immediately relaxed. He asked, “If I go, will I be attacked by even stronger existences?”
 [No, the Chaotic River of Destiny is a special space. It can only be entered by the soul and can only be met by karma. The system will isolate other karma other than the other party.]
 I see.
  Han Jue was enlightened. At the same time, he felt his memories flowing away. This feeling was very strange, but as a Great Dao Sage, he could indeed feel it.
 He immediately chose to go.
 Immediately after, his soul jumped out of the Heavenly Dao and the chaos, arriving at a higher domain.
 Han Jue took a closer look. The surroundings were filled with a fantasy seven-colored light that was distorted and dizzying.
 Under Han Jue’s feet was a golden river of light formed by countless stars. Even as a Great Dao Sage, he couldn’t count them at a glance. They were too dense and endless.
 Looking up, he couldn’t see the end in all directions, including above.
 Was this the Chaotic River of Destiny?
 Frowning, Han Jue immediately searched for the mysterious existence who wanted to erase his past.
 Soon, he locked onto a direction and immediately rushed over.
 In an instant, he arrived behind a figure.
 This figure was a black shadow. His true appearance could not be seen. He kept waving his hand at the River of Destiny below.
 Without another word, Han Jue waved his palm.
 Great Change Sealing Palm!
 The black shadow suddenly disappeared and dodged the palm. It appeared dozens of feet away.
 “It’s you?”
 The black shadow was shocked. Han Jue had a strange expression.
 The voice was familiar.
 Fang Liang!
 Han Jue frowned. Wasn’t Fang Liang already purified? Why was he here to erase his past?
 Could it be that this Fang Liang was not the Fang Liang of his timeline?
 Han Jue asked, “Why do this?”
 The black shadow couldn’t hide his shock and muttered, “You’ve already attained the Great Dao?”
 Han Jue attacked again and suddenly appeared behind him. He used the Great Change Sealing Palm.
 Fang Liang continued to dodge, and Han Jue chased after him.
 “Grandmaster! Wait! I’m not trying to harm you!” Fang Liang said anxiously.
 Han Jue stopped and said, “Tell me honestly, or you will die.”
 Fang Liang stopped and said, “I’m from the timeline of the Great Dao Calamity. Your identity as the Dark Forbidden Lord has been exposed. The mighty figures of the Chaos want to get rid of you, so I want to erase your past so that they can’t deduce your existence.”
 Han Jue still frowned.
 He asked in his mind, “If he successfully erases my past, will I die?”
 [No, but you will be rejected by the Chaos and the Heavenly Dao. You will flow into an unknown blank domain.)
 “What is a blank domain?”
 (No karma. The system cannot derive it.]
 He hesitated.
 At least he wouldn’t die immediately after his past was erased. In other words, Fang Liang’s words were still credible.
 Han Jue snorted. “So what if I’m their enemy? I’m not afraid. Don’t do this for me in the future. This isn’t the first time!”
 He remembered that Fang Liang’s soul had transmigrated to the Primordial Era and also wanted to change his fate. Although it was for his own good, he did not need it.
 The path he was taking now was the correct
  path!
 The current Dao Field array formation was at the Dao Creator level. Even if the Chaotic Deities attacked, they wouldn’t be able to break through in a short period of time.
 Moreover, even if the future Chaotic Deities sensed him, they wouldn’t be able to deduce him. The Dao Field could block all prying!
 Fang Liang hesitated.
 Han Jue waved his hand. “Get lost!”
 Fang Liang took a deep breath and said, “Grandmaster, it’s my wish to see you again. Since you’ve already decided, I won’t insist. I can only give you another piece of advice. Don’t advance the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity.”
 With that, he disappeared.
 Han Jue immediately left and returned to his body.
 He opened his eyes and recalled Fang Liang’s words.
 Advancing the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity?
 Why would I do that?
 There was only one possibility. Someone had provoked him, or someone related to him had died.
 Han Jue hesitated.
 Should he summon all the disciples outside?
 Forget it.
 If he did this, he would probably change something
 Han Jue asked in his mind, “How long until the next Great Dao Calamity?”
 (1 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [If there are no major changes, it will be in about 23 billion years.]
 Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief. Fortunately, there was no change.
 He was puzzled. “Why can’t I sense what Fang Liang did previously?”
 (Because he entered the Chaotic River of Destiny. This river is higher than the ordinary River of Destiny and is above the Chaos. It is extremely difficult to find. If the future you is still alive, even without the system, the future you will quickly sense it unless the future you is suppressed.]
 That made sense. In the future, he would be hunted down by the Chaotic Deities. He might be restrained and suppressed, unable to save his past self.
 It was so difficult. Why could Fang Liang find it?
 ..
 Could it be that he had borrowed the power of the Dao Ancestor?
 “I have to be careful in the future. I can’t leave the Heavenly Dao easily.”
 Han Jue thought silently.
 [It involves the karma of the Chaos Core. It cannot be deduced to prevent the backlash of karma.]
 Han Jue was stunned.
 This was the first time such a situation had happened. In the past, he couldn’t deduce it because the other party was stronger than the system.
 The danger in the Chaos was indeed very deep.
 Han Jue cursed silently.
 After being played by Fang Liang, he suddenly lost confidence. Previously, he was still very arrogant. After all, even Ancestor Xitian was not his match.
 Han Jue suddenly hoped that a powerful enemy would attack the Heavenly Dao so that he could increase his confidence.
  He was indeed not strong enough to face the Chaotic Deities now.
 Han Jue shook his head. He took out the Heavenly Dao Spirit Stone and the Book of Misfortune and decided to strengthen it and other Dharma treasures. He couldn’t resist the Chaotic Deities either, so he might as well go all the way.
 From Fang Liang’s words, he knew that the Chaotic Deities couldn’t deduce the Dark Forbidden Lord’s true identity. He had been exposed by someone.
 He made up his mind not to use the Book of Misfortune easily in the future. It was best to wait until the Book of Misfortune could injure the Chaotic Deities.
 Han Jue observed the Immortal World as he upgraded the book.
 The Sages would probably start scheming again.
 Han Jue had no intention of fighting. Now that he had grasped the Great Change Sealing Palm, even if the new Sage was disobedient, he could just throw him into the Primordial Heavenly Prison.


 This fellow really knew how to read the mood.
 Han Jue had no choice but to put the Heavenly Dao Spirit Stone and the Book of Misfortune into the Primordial World. He multitasked and let them continue to fuse.
 He followed them to the 33rd Heaven and entered the Universal Hall.
 The Sages arrived one after another.
 Indeed.
 It was for the new Sage position.
  As usual, Han Jue didn’t speak and watched the Sages fight.
 Emperor Xiao said, “The Devil Race’s Sage position should be here soon. I’ve been waiting for countless years.”
 Qiu Xilai said disdainfully, “Our Western Sect is also waiting!”
 The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate said in a strange tone, “The Human School originally had two seats. The Heavenly Venerate has worked hard and contributed greatly. He should think about the Human School, right, everyone?”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du glanced at the South Extreme Heavenly Venerate and was puzzled. How had he offended him?
 Pan Xin said, “The Chaotic Heavenly Road needs Sages. This spot should belong to me.”
 He thickened his face and asked for it directly.
 For a time, the Sages began to fight and argue.
 Shi Dudao stood up and left.
 Li Daokong immediately followed. Soon, the pressure of the two Sages fighting came from the void.
 Han Jue didn’t leave and looked at the Sages with relish.
 He had already widened the gap between him and the Heavenly Dao Sages, including Pan Xin and Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du. None of them were a threat to him. Watching the Sages argue could add to his peaceful cultivation years.
 After a while.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du looked at him and asked, “What do you think, Fellow Daoist Han?”
 Han Jue smiled. “You’re asking me? Then give it to me so that we don’t get into a dispute.”
 The Sages were stunned and surprised.
 This was not Han Jue’s style.
 Qiu Xilai immediately said, “I think so, too!”
 Sect Master Tian Jue said, “Fellow Daoist Han has contributed greatly to the Heavenly Dao. We should indeed reward the Hidden Sect with a Sage Seat.”
 Heavenly Venerate Wufa, Fang Liang, and Huang Zuntian agreed.
 Pan Xin was expressionless, but his heart twitched.
 He was certain that these five Sages were definitely Han Jue’s lackeys!
 There was also Li Daokong, who had just gone out, and Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du, who had been fawning over Han Jue. The seven Sages were all supporting Han Jue.
 The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate also saw through it and immediately chose to support Han Jue. Sooner or later, he would have to take sides. He could accept following Han Jue.
 In any case, the Heavenly Dao couldn’t be led by Pan Xin and Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du!
 Eight Sages…
 Together with Han Jue, there were nine Sages!
 Pan Xin’s heart skipped a beat. The situation was not optimistic.
 He immediately looked at Han Jue and asked, “Fellow Daoist Han wants to fight with me?”
 No matter how scheming he was, he could tell that Han Jue was the leader. If he gave in to him, the other Sages wouldn’t stop him.
 He began to suspect if Han Jue had asked the Sages to scheme against him.
 Han Jue said, “You really want it?” Pan Xin said, “Of course!” “Who are you going to choose?”
 “There’s no fixed person for the time being.”
 Dao Sovereign was once the number one prodigy in the Immortal World. Now that he was a Pseudo-Sage expert, he was indeed qualified!
 Pan Xin frowned. “The Chaotic Heavenly Road needs Sages to guard it. If you insist, send a Sage to the Chaos.”
 The Sages were silent.
 Han Jue also fell silent.
 Who dared to go to the Chaos?
 Han Jue was afraid of the Chaotic Deities and couldn’t go out.
 Pan Xin said proudly, “You’re timid. Why do you want to fight with me? I’m also thinking for the Heavenly Dao. In the future, the Heavenly Dao will definitely face stronger enemies and also need the Sages to go to the Chaos to open up new worlds. Don’t delay the development of the Heavenly Dao for the sake of power.”
 Han Jue smiled. “In that case, I’ll give it to you, but you have to choose someone from the Heavenly Dao.”
 Pan Xin said, “Of course.”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du added, “The new Sage position will be decided by Fellow Daoist Pan.”
 Seeing that Han Jue had agreed, the other Sages naturally had nothing to say. The Sage Meeting ended.
 The Sages left.
 Pan Xin invited him to Pangu Hall as a guest, and Han Jue didn’t refuse.
 The two of them came to the Pangu Hall and sat down. Han Jue could feel that the Pangu Hall had already activated the restriction and could block the prying of Sages.
 Pan Xin sighed heavily.
 Pretending to be puzzled, Han Jue asked, “Fellow Daoist Pan, you just obtained the position. Why are you sighing?”
 Pan Xin said, “Fellow Daoist Han, I’m older than you and can be considered an old friend. Why don’t we call each other brothers? I’m suffering. You should have heard of my previous encounters. Now, I look powerful, but I’m being pushed forward without freedom. I want to repay the Heavenly Dao, but the Sages are always wary of me…”
 Hearing this fellow call himself brother, Han Jue couldn’t help but narrow his eyes. He hesitated if he should throw Pan Xin into the Primordial Heavenly Prison now.
 “Brother Han, you must support me in the future. I know that the reason why you protected the Heavenly Dao is that you want to obtain the Heavenly Dao’s protection. I’ll protect the Heavenly Dao and the Heavenly Dao will protect you. If we join forces, we can definitely reach the Great Dao together!” Pan Xin said with great ambition.
 This time, Han Jue took the initiative to give him the Sage position, allowing him to see hope.
 If he could rope Han Jue in, he would have the final say in the Heavenly Dao!
 Pan Xin was very excited just thinking about it.
 Han Jue asked, “Why do you want to control the Heavenly Dao so much? I see that you really don’t have the talent to manage it.”
 Pan Xin’s face didn’t go red and his heartbeat didn’t accelerate. He said, “Only then can I train. But in the end, it’s a choice. No matter how talented Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du is, his master is the father of the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End!
 “I’m different. I’m Pangu’s descendant. Protecting the Heavenly Dao is protecting Giant God Pangu!”
 Han Jue asked, “What will you do after you unify the Heavenly Dao?”
 It’s time!
 Pan Xin suppressed his surprise. He felt that he was about to succeed!
 He wasn’t in a hurry to answer. Instead, he thought for a moment and said, “Xuan Du’s idea of developing the Chaos is correct, but if the Heavenly Dao wants to truly gain a foothold in the Chaos, it still has to find a backer. While developing the Heavenly Dao, I will seek a huge backer for the Heavenly Dao, a backer that can intimidate the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End. My initial goal is the ancient Great Dao Divine Spirit. Although the Great Dao Divine Spirit is at the same realm as the Great Dao Sages, those ancient Great Dao Divine Spirits all have the power to suppress the Great Dao Sages.”
 Han Jue smiled.
  Pan Xin smiled and asked, “Old Brother Han, you agree with me, right?”
 Han Jue suddenly raised his palm and struck him.
 Pan Xin did not have time to react and instantly froze. His Dharmic powers were sealed by the Great Change Sealing Palm and his soul could not escape his body. “You…”
 Pan Xin widened his eyes in disbelief.
 Without another word, Han Jue brought him to the Daoist temple of the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 Pan Xin was thrown into the Primordial Heavenly Prison. He glared at him, his eyes filled with confusion, fear, and disbelief.
 He was confused about why Han Jue attacked! He was fearful of his strength!
 He was in disbelief. Why could Han Jue directly suppress him?
