 There were not many casualties on the Heavenly Dao’s side, but all living beings were still very excited.
 Because they finally saw how powerful the Divine Might Heavenly Sage was!
 All the cultivators in Chaotic City, Zenith Heaven Golden Immortals, and Pseudo-Sages saw Han Jue’s attack. The cultivators who went to the Chaotic Heavenly Road later could also see the spatial crack left behind by the battlefield and the long spatial cave that was even wider than the Chaotic Heavenly Road. It was shocking
 “Oh my god, what cultivation level is this to cause such terrifying destruction!”
 “The Great Dao Divine Spirit is nothing much.”
 “Too fast. Is this the Divine Might Heavenly Sage? I’m still packing my bags.” “The Heavenly Dao is mighty!”
  “The ancient people didn’t lie to me. The Divine Might Heavenly Sage is indeed powerful. The legends are all true.” “Where’s the Hatred Race? They’re all dead?”
 This was a huge battle. If the Heavenly Dao lost, they would probably die.
 This battle was mentioned many times when the Sages preached the Dao in the future. They warned their descendants never to indulge in the current peace.
 Han Jue didn’t care about the opinions of all living beings. To be honest, he was not excited.
 The Divine Robe Daoist and the Foolish Sword Sage could not be insta-killed.
 Han Jue was still filled with danger.
 He had to hurry up and cultivate. He had to insta-kill the enemy if he attacked in the future!
 Just as the Foolish Sword Sage had said, after this battle, no mighty figure would dare to invade the Heavenly Dao again.
 A thousand years later, the Heavenly Dao was successfully repaired. The 33rd Heaven returned to its former peace. The Sages were stimulated and began to focus on cultivating.
 After witnessing Han Jue’s strength, they all felt tiny.
 Including Great Sage Void Soul.
 Han Jue moved Great Sage Void Soul into the Hundred Peak Immortal River. After the Heavenly Dao recovered, he was expelled by it and was quite depressed. Fortunately, Han Jue took the time to move him in.
 Just like that, peace returned.
 Five thousand years later.
 Han Jue was cultivating when a notification suddenly appeared in front of him.
 (The Evil Heavenly Emperor sent you a dream. Do you accept?)
 Han Jue’s heart trembled. Did something happen again?
 He was traumatized, but the other party was the Evil Heavenly Emperor, so he could not refuse.
 He immediately accepted the dream.
 The dream was still the forest outside the Jade Pure Sacred Sect.
 Seeing Han Jue, the Evil Heavenly Emperor clicked his tongue in wonder. “You’re really powerful. You can even kill the Divine Robe Daoist. It’s said that that battle even involved the leader of the Hatred Race, Hatred Concubine, and the Foolish Sword Sage. You became famous after that battle. Now, the name of the Divine Might Heavenly Sage is spreading in the Chaos.”
 Han Jue frowned and asked, “Am I very famous?”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor smiled. “It’s neither big nor small. After all, the Chaos is vast and boundless. There are always places where they can’t hear your reputation.”
 Han Jue looked worried. He didn’t pretend to be calm in front of the Evil Heavenly Emperor.
 Han Jue was speechless. In that case, he had to thank Life?
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor said seriously, “I sent you a dream this time to tell you something. I know an ancient existence. Not long ago, I visited him and asked him to predict the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity.”
 Han Jue raised his eyebrows. An ancient existence who could predict the Great Dao Calamity?
 Could it be a Dao Creator!
 After talking to the Foolish Sword Sage, Han Jue discovered that the living beings of the Chaos didn’t believe in the existence of the Chaotic Deities at all. Even the once Great Dao Supreme Foolish Sword Sage thought that the Great Dao Supreme Realm was already the strongest.
 “He deduced that the sign of the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity is the Primordial Fiendcelestial. This Primordial Fiendcelestial’s potential is unparalleled since ancient times. It’s unimaginable. He can sweep through people of the same realm and even cross realms to kill enemies. To him, cultivation realms are nothing.” The Evil Heavenly Emperor recalled the words of that ancient existence and felt a chill in his heart.
 Han Jue had a strange expression.
 Crap!
 Could the battle of the Heavenly Dao not have made people think that he was the Primordial Fiendcelestial?
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor also thought of this. His expression also became strange. “Are you the Primordial Fiendcelestial?”
 Han Jue denied it firmly. “How is that possible? I was born as a mortal. You can deduce it. My parents are both mortals. How can they give birth to a Primordial Fiendcelestial? Aren’t Chaotic Fiendcelestials fatherless, let alone Primordial Fiendcelestials?”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor smiled. “That’s true. Don’t be nervous. I know something about the Primordial Fiendcelestial and know that you’re not it.” “What do you know?”
 “The Primordial Fiendcelestial has yet to be born!
 “What’s there to be afraid of? He can overturn the Chaos when he’s born? We can just kill him in the cradle.”
 Han Jue didn’t care, but he was very nervous.
 Isn’t that my son?!
 I knew it!
 The one who causes the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity is my son!
 Han Jue had a bold thought. If his son was never born, wouldn’t the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity never arrive?
 No wonder it took ten billion years!
 Han Jue couldn’t surpass the Primordial Fiendcelestial and couldn’t bear to let his son give up his talent. He could only let him stay in his mother’s womb.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor smiled. “Of course. I guess the other mighty figures will also know about this. The Chaos will stir up a trend of finding the Primordial Fiendcelestial. The prodigies in the future will be miserable.”
 He said it casually, but Han Jue heard a hint of pity. Countless geniuses would die because of a prophecy.
 Han Jue didn’t feel guilty. He was not someone who valued all living beings more than his family.
 Furthermore, even without his son, as a Primordial Fiendcelestial, he would have to face all the hostility of the Chaos sooner or later.
 Before that, he wanted to secretly cultivate until the entire Chaos could not do anything to him!
 The two of them continued chatting.
  An hour later, the dream ended.
 Han Jue observed the Heavenly Dao. After confirming that there was no danger, he checked his interpersonal relationships. The friends he cared about were still there. He continued cultivating.
 Time passed.
 Year after year passed. Thousands of years later.
 Three lines of words appeared in front of Han Jue, who was cultivating.
 [Detected that you are 500,000 years old and your life has taken another step forward. You have the following choices:]
 (1: Come out immediately and spread the name of the Primordial Fiendcelestial, stirring up the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment, a Creation Spirit Stone, a Heavenly Dao Spirit Stone, a Supreme Treasure, a Mystical Power inheritance, and a new function of the system.]
 [2: Cultivate in a low-profile manner and stay away from trouble. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment, a Creation Spirit Stone, a Heavenly Dao Spirit Stone, and a Supreme Treasure.]


 Han Jue felt that the system was broken.
 There had been such a choice in the past, but this time, it was too exaggerated.
 Han Jue directly chose the second option.
 (You choose to cultivate in a low profile manner and stay away from trouble. You obtained a Great Dao Fragment, a Creation Spirit Stone, a Heavenly Dao Spirit Stone, and a Supreme Treasure.]
 [Congratulations on obtaining the Chaotic Supreme Treasure-Grand Primordium Divine Crown]
 (Grand Primordium Divine Crown: Defensive Chaotic Supreme Treasure. It is formed from the head of a Grand Primordium Deity when he died. It contains the strongest defense and can resist Great Dao-level attacks. ]
  Great!
 Another defensive Supreme Treasure!
 Han Jue immediately took out the Grand Primordium Divine Crown and started to make it recognize him as its owner.
 The Grand Primordium Divine Crown was purple. There were two statues on the crown. They were symmetrical on both sides like horns. They were both domineering and had sinister expressions as if the scene before the battle had frozen.
 After eighty years, Han Jue finally refined it into his own Dharma treasure.
 After wearing this crown, Han Jue looked even more handsome and dignified, like the king of the gods from ancient legends. It was terrifying.
 Han Jue was in a good mood and began to think about which Fiendcelestial to use the Creation Spirit Stone on.
 Forget it!
 Han Jue began to fuse.
 He continued cultivating after the fusion process stabilized.
 As for what to use the Heavenly Dao Spirit Stone on, he still had to consider it.
 It had been a long time since he had cursed someone. If he used the Heavenly Dao Spirit Stone on the Heaven-Opening Axe, how far could it go from a Chaotic Supreme Treasure?
 What kind of power would it have If the Primordial Divine Rage was used together with the Heaven-Opening Axe that surpassed the Chaotic Supreme Treasure level?
 The battle with the Foolish Sword Sage made Han Jue a little dissatisfied with his strength.
 As for the curse power, it was very difficult to curse an existence stronger than him to death.
 Time passed.
 The cultivators who went to the Chaos also spread the name of the Divine Might Heavenly Sage everywhere. In addition, the death of the Great Dao Divine Spirit was true. The Divine Might Heavenly Sage’s reputation became greater and greater, making the Heavenly Dao cultivators feel proud.
 The providence of the Heavenly Dao soared.
 In the blink of an eye.
 Fifty thousand years passed.
 Han Jue was getting closer and closer to breaking through. He finally saw the opportunity to break through and was extremely touched.
 Heaven did not let down those who worked hard!
 He opened his eyes. More than a thousand years ago, Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du had sent him a voice transmission, asking for him to go to the Universal Hall after his seclusion ended.
 Han Jue first came to the second Dao Field and released the Nine Yin Fiendcelestial to let Murong Qi receive him.
 Han Jue chatted with Li Yao for a while before returning to the main Dao Field and jumping into the Universal Hall.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du opened his eyes and immediately sent a voice transmission to the other Sages when he saw him.
 The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate, Sect Master Tian Jue, Emperor Xiao, Heavenly Venerate Wufa, Qiu Xilai, Fang Liang, Huang Zuntian, Jin Shen, Pan Xin, Xu Dudao, Su Qi, and Li Taigu arrived one after another.
 Han Jue nodded slightly and didn’t say anything. In any case, the leader was Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du.
 He had never managed the Heavenly Dao. Not in the past and not in the future.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du was a very qualified Sage.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “Not long ago, Shi Dudao and Li Daokong’s Heavenly Dao providence was severed. Two Sage positions became vacant. In addition to the recent strengthening of the Heavenly Dao, another Sage position opened. There are a total of three. Do you have any candidates?”
 The Sages looked at Han Jue. After all, it involved Li Daokong.
 Han Jue said, “You can decide for yourselves. As for Li Daokong, don’t worry about him. I know what to do.”
 Hearing this, the Sages felt relieved and began to discuss.
 Han Jue felt bored and started to check his emails.
 (Your good friend Evil Heavenly Emperor was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure.]
 (Your disciple Zhou Fan was attacked by demons] X7890002
 [Your son Han Tuo was attacked by demons] X8902143
 (Your disciple Dao Sovereign has entered a mysterious space-time dimension.]
 (Your disciple Zhao Xuanyuan has entered a mysterious space-time dimension.)
 [Your good friend Jiang Yi has entered a mysterious space-time dimension.]
 [Your good friend Heavenly Lord of Primordial Beginning was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure.)
 [Your good friend Huang Zuntian split heaven and earth and created the Chaotic World. His providence has increased greatly.]
 It was as exciting as ever.
 Han Jue was curious. “Are all the mysterious mighty figures stronger than me?” He was already a Great Dao Sage. Very few people could be considered mighty figures in front of him.
 (After reaching the Freedom Realm and having no karma with you, they are all considered mysterious mighty figures.)
 I see.
 Han Jue was relieved. He thought that there were as many Great Dao Sages as dogs.
 He continued reading the emails.
 Huang Zuntian established a Chaotic World?
 He couldn’t help but glance at him. This fellow had made a huge move. He had not even severed with the providence of the Heavenly Dao.
 Sensing his gaze, Huang Zuntian couldn’t help but straighten his back and salute him with his eyes.
 He would talk to him later.
 Han Jue thought silently.
 Huang Zuntian’s master, Sect Master Tian Jue, had already submitted to Han Jue. There was no need to beat around the bush.
 The emails after that were also exciting. After all, after tens of thousands of years, almost all his friends had made a move.
 An hour later, the Sage position was finalized. Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “Recently, a mighty figure from the Chaos has held a banquet and invited the masters of the world to befriend him and discuss how to face the future Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity. What do you think?”
 Heavenly Venerate Wufa glanced at him and snorted. “What do you mean? Is a Freedom Sage weak?”
  Qiu Xilai knew that he had said something wrong and had no choice but to shut up.
 The other Sages expressed their opinions. They had to vote to decide. Han Jue didn’t participate.
 In the end, Pan Xin, Sect Master Tian Jue, and Fang Liang voted in favor to go.
 Pan Xin was a Freedom Sage and represented the deterrence of the Heavenly Dao. Sect Master Tian Jue would lead the negotiations and Fang Liang was in charge of plotting.
 The Sages left after the discussion ended.
 Han Jue said, “Fellow Daoist Huang, can you invite me to your Dao Field for a chat?” Huang Zuntian immediately agreed. The other Sages pretended not to hear that.
 Recently, Huang Zuntian had indeed been a little mysterious. He often went to the Chaos. It was a good thing for Han Jue to teach him a lesson.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du secretly sighed. Fortunately, there was Han Jue. He was also worried that Huang Zuntian would betray the Heavenly Dao.


 Han Jue sat at the main seat, while Huang Zuntian, the master of the Dao Field, sat as a guest.
 Without waiting for Han Jue to ask, Huang Zuntian said, “I created a world in the Chaos more than twenty thousand years ago…”
 He spoke endlessly and was very excited as if he was showing off his achievements in front of his elders.
 Han Jue listened carefully and did not interrupt.
 Huang Zuntian began to talk about his reason for creating a world. It was naturally because of Primordial Origin.
 Han Jue already knew about Primordial Origin. This was a secret between the two.
  With the Primordial Origin’s help, even if he established the Chaotic World, Huang Zuntian did not sever the providence of the Heavenly Dao. Primordial Origin said that this was a way out for him.
 All these years, Huang Zuntian’s cultivation level had been increasing. He was already very close to breaking through to the Primordial Chaos Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm.
 He suddenly understood why Huang Zuntian could reach his current height.
 As long as Huang Zuntian’s favorability didn’t decrease, he was still willing to believe him.
 Han Jue instructed, “Be careful. Think about how you got to where you are today. Never be careless. Maintain a good relationship with the Heavenly Dao Sages. The current Heavenly Dao is already united. As for who has this rope, you should know very well. If you need help, you can also ask the Sages. Don’t isolate yourself. That will only cause unnecessary trouble for you.”
 Huang Zuntian nodded. “Thank you for your reminder, Master. I will remember it.”
 He had seen through it before, but Han Jue didn’t admit it personally, so he couldn’t trust the other Sages.
 Now that Han Jue said so, how could he not be relieved?
 The two of them chatted for a while more, mostly about Huang Zuntian’s experiences in the Chaos. Han Jue listened to the story with relish.
 Huang Zuntian heaved a sigh of relief after he left.
 Although he was very loyal to Han Jue, the pressure he gave him was too strong.
 A voice sounded in Huang Zuntian’s mind, “This person is not simple. If he wants to attack me, he will definitely have a way to extract me from your body.”
 Huang Zuntian said proudly, “Of course. Otherwise, why would I follow him?” Ever since he knew Han Jue, he had never seen him lose or even be in a sorry state.
 After returning to the Daoist temple, Han Jue continued cultivating.
 He only had one goal now, and that was to break through as soon as possible!
 Once he closed his eyes, it meant that another era had passed.
 Ever since the Divine Robe Daoist was defeated, no expert dared to attack the Heavenly Dao again. New worlds also constantly appeared in the Dark Forbidden Zone near the Heavenly Dao. They were all created by the Heavenly Dao cultivators. Some Zenith Heaven Golden Immortals with poor potential discovered that creating a world could allow them to advance to the Pseudo-Sage Realm, causing more and more Zenith Heaven Golden Immortals to head to the Dark Forbidden Zone.
 Year after year passed.
 Soon, Han Jue was 600,000 years old.
 [Detected that you are 600,000 years old. You have the following choices:)
 (1: Exit seclusion immediately and spread the name of the Primordial Fiendcelestial, stirring up the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment, a Creation Spirit Stone, and a Heavenly Dao Spirit Stone.)
 [2: Cultivate in a low-profile manner and stay away from trouble. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment, a Creation Spirit Stone, and a Supreme Treasure.]
 Han Jue opened his eyes and discovered that the reward had decreased.
 Perhaps five hundred thousand years meant
 more.
 Han Jue silently chose the second option.
 [You chose to cultivate in a low profile manner and stay away from trouble. You obtained a Great Dao Fragment, a Creation Spirit Stone, and a Supreme Treasure.]
 (Congratulations on obtaining the Chaotic Supreme Treasure—Chaotic Diamond Bracelet]
 [Chaotic Diamond Bracelet: Defensive Chaotic Supreme Treasure. It is a Supreme Treasure born at the beginning of the Chaos. It contains the strongest defensive light and can block Great Dao attacks.]
 Another defensive Supreme Treasure!
  Han Jue almost fainted.
 Back when he was still growing, the system loved to give him defensive Dharma treasures.
 In addition to the Chaotic Diamond Bracelet, he had a total of three Chaotic Defensive Supreme Treasures.
 Who could break through his defense?
 Han Jue immediately took out the Chaotic Diamond Bracelet and started to make it recognize him as its owner.
 After a hundred years, he finally refined it into this Dharma treasure.
 The Chaotic Diamond Bracelet was golden. It was originally a golden ring, but after wearing it, it transformed into two wisps of golden flames that wrapped around his wrists. It looked very beautiful.
 A
 Han Jue looked up at the Divine Robe Daoist, who was still in the Primordial Heavenly Prison.
 It had been almost 120,000 years, but this fellow had yet to be enslaved!
 Han Jue had to renew the seal every ten thousand years to prevent him from awakening.
 This time, he chose the Wind Shaking Fiendcelestial.
 After the fusion process stabilized, he would divert his attention.
 He was already very close to breaking through to the mid-stage Great Dao Primordial Chaos Realm, so he was not in a hurry. He wanted to see the development of the Heavenly Dao first.
 During this period of time, three new Sages appeared in the Heavenly Dao.
 They were Primordial Chaos Buddha, Zhang Guxing, and Long Hao.
 Zhang Guxing was chosen by Heavenly Venerate Wufa. There was an 80% chance that this was in consideration of Han Jue. He had very little karma in the Heavenly Dao, and Zhang Guxing was one of the few.
 Apart from him, there were a total of sixteen Heavenly Dao Sages in the current Immortal World. They far exceeded any previous era.
 The new Sages almost did not rely on the Primordial Purple Qi. Reality proved that the Primordial Purple Qi was only an excuse. In the past, there had been no new Sages. It was mainly because the Heavenly Dao was too weak and could not carry more Sages.
 The birth of every new Sage excited the cultivators of the Immortal World.
 Han Jue took in the various forms of living beings. The situation of the Heavenly Dao was still considered peaceful. Although the Hidden Sect was not outstanding, its development was at least stable. He did not need the Hidden Sect to unite the Heavenly Dao. That wouldn’t be good.
 He needed to give the other factions some hope. Only then could they continue to climb.
 Han Jue’s situation had never been to control the Heavenly Dao. In the past, the Heavenly Dao was only a shield. Now, he only hoped that the Heavenly Dao could protect his disciples.
 After observing the Heavenly Dao, Han Jue started to check his emails.
 He wondered if something interesting had happened in his circle of friends recently.
 Email after email appeared in front of Han Jue and refreshed at an extremely fast speed. In an instant, he read millions of emails.
 An email attracted Han Jue’s attention.
  (Your enemy Pangu has successfully reincarnated.]
 Pangu!
 Does this fellow want to cause trouble?
 Han Jue narrowed his eyes and fell into deep thought.
 Pangu’s hatred for him was not high. He could only say that he was dissatisfied and not an enemy.
 However, Pangu’s history was too valiant. The entire Chaos treated him as a nightmare and was afraid that he would revive.
 Unexpectedly, he did not revive but chose the path of reincarnation.
 How did he reincarnate?


 After all, the Heavenly Dao was created by Pangu. If he returned, how could the Heavenly Dao stop him?
 [100 trillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Although his value was ridiculous, he had to continue!
 Han Jue entered the illusion.
 He opened his eyes and discovered that he was standing in the starry sky. Below him was a desolate planet without flowers and plants. Looking up, countless such planets were floating in the entire starry sky. No signs of living beings could be seen.
 Han Jue looked over and didn’t see Pangu on the desolate planet.
  At this moment!
 A beam of light descended from above at an extremely fast speed. It directly collided with the barren planet, causing the entire planet to tremble violently. It stirred up circles of dust that were tens of thousands of feet tall.
 After the dust dissipated, Han Jue saw a huge egg. The eggshell was transparent and emitted a red light. There were many veins on the surface, and he could vaguely see a figure curled up inside.
 Was that Pangu?
 But what was this place?
 Han Jue frowned. A line of words appeared in front of him.
 [Daoless Deep Region: Chaotic Desolate Domain. There are no Great Dao rules, no karma, no past or future.]
 Han Jue frowned even more. Although he knew the name of this place, he still didn’t know where it was.
 The illusion shattered.
 Han Jue returned to reality. He checked Pangu’s profile picture.
 (Pangu: Cultivation unknown. Chaotic Fiendcelestial, Creator of the Heavenly Dao, ancestor of all things, Fiendcelestial Slayer. Because you severed the will control he left in Pan Xin, he has developed displeasure towards you. Current Hatred Points: 1 star]
 Why was his cultivation still unknown?
 Didn’t he reincarnate?
 Could it be that it was not really a reincarnation, but a Dharma idol?
 Han Jue asked in his mind, “How long will it take for Pangu to kill me after he reincarnates?”
 [100 trillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 (Unless you stop cultivating or his main body revives, he will never be able to kill you.]
 Unless the main body revives…
 I knew it!
 Han Jue’s brows relaxed.
 No matter what, Pangu’s reincarnation could not threaten him.
 Han Jue stopped thinking about it and continued reading the emails.
 Time passed quickly.
 Another thirty thousand years passed.
 (Divine Robe Daoist has a favorable impression of you. Current favorability: Max.)
 Han Jue opened his eyes and frowned.
 The Divine Robe Daoist in the Primordial Heavenly Prison was still in a soul state. Han Jue removed the seal and his body began to recover.
 Han Jue checked his profile picture.
 [Divine Robe Daoist: Perfected Great Dao Primordial Chaos Realm, Great Dao Divine Spirit. Current favorability: Max.]
 It was a simple introduction, but it was enough.
 He was clearly only a minor realm higher than Great Sage Void Soul. The enslavement time had increased by ten times!
 Divine Robe Daoist knelt down respectfully after he recovered.
 Han Jue asked in his mind, “Will I expose the existence of the Primordial Heavenly Prison if I let the Divine Robe Daoist back and make him not reveal his experience of being enslaved?”
 It was better to let the Divine Robe Daoist stay here and continue being a Great Dao Divine Spirit. It could protect the Chaotic Domain where the Heavenly Dao was.
 From the upper echelons to the bottom, they were all Han Jue’s people!
 (200 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [No]
 Han Jue immediately smiled upon seeing this word.
 He began to chat with the Divine Robe Daoist.
 Several hours later, the Divine Robe Daoist was sent out of the Heavenly Dao and flew into the darkness.
 Han Jue had already told him everything he needed to know. In the future, the Divine Robe Daoist would be an important pawn of
 his.
 Then, Han Jue came to the second Dao Field and released Wind Shaking Fiendcelestial to let Murong Qi receive him.
 As the Combat Fiendcelestial, Murong Qi was not weak either. He was often evenly matched even when he fought the Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial in the simulation trial.
 Han Jue chatted with Li Yao for a while before arriving at Yang Du’s cave abode.
 In the long years, Yang Du was almost depressed. As more and more Fiendcelestials appeared, his potential was extremely blinding here. Even he felt that he was not worthy. Although Han Jue could help him change his bloodline, he couldn’t even see a trace of hope at the basic Pseudo-Sage threshold.
 Yang Du opened his eyes and hurriedly knelt down when he saw that it was Han Jue. He was excited and knew what he had to face next.
 Han Jue said, “I’ve indeed made you suffer all these years. I understand the burden in your mind, but I just want you to remember this burden. No matter what is your potential, you can never lose your reverence and determination to cultivate diligently. Do you understand?”
 Han Jue didn’t say anything else. He directly dispersed his body and placed his soul into the Primordial World. He then teleported into the main Dao Field.
 Yang Du was already a Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal, but it was very difficult for his cultivation level to increase. He couldn’t even see hope in the mid-stage. This was the upper limit of his potential. After all, Han Jue didn’t preach the Dao as often in the second Dao Field.
 Han Jue sat on the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus and fused the Fiendcelestial Qi of Yang Du and the Dugu Fiendcelestial.
 The reason was that their names were similar.
 Han Jue multitasked. As he used his Dharmic powers to help Yang Du fuse with the Fiendcelestial Qi, he began to preach the Dao in the main Dao Field.
 The sudden lecture made all the disciples in the Hundred Peak Immortal River unable to react in time as they were pulled into the Great Dao of Extreme Origin.
 Chaos, Great Dao Tower.
 Dressed in white, Han Yu came to the hall with his grand-disciple Qin Ling and met the Tower Master, Zhou Fan.
 The current Zhou Fan wore a python-patterned black robe and was extremely domineering. He was no longer the hot-blooded youth from before.
 Zhou Fan opened his eyes, and they lit up when he saw Han Yu.
 Too similar!
 He was even more like Han Jue than Han Tuo, his own son!
 He even instinctively wanted to kneel down. Fortunately, he restrained himself in time and no one noticed.
 Han Yu cupped his hands and bowed.
  Life?
 Han Yu frowned. He had been in the Chaos for hundreds of thousands of years and had naturally heard of the legend of Life.
 He subconsciously wanted to deny it.
 It was not impossible!
 Qin Ling asked, “Even the Hidden Sect can’t touch the Life faction? Your master has killed thirteen Lives!”
 Zhou Fan glared at him and scolded him. “Isn’t my master your Grandmaster? How can you address him as ‘your master’? Where are your manners?!”


 Zhou Fan looked pleased. He hesitated for a moment and said in a low voice, “Don’t investigate Li Daokong’s matter anymore. My master knows this matter. It involves confidential information. You should know what it means.”
 Han Yu’s eyes lit up when he heard this. He asked excitedly, “My master didn’t succumb?”
 Zhou Fan nodded.
 Han Yu took a deep breath and finally smiled.
 He knew it!
 Han Yu shook his head. “What will he say even if I see him? Since I know about Master, I should go back and protect Buzhou Divine Mountain.”
 Zhou Fan had no objections. After exchanging a few pleasantries with Han Yu, he asked Qin Ling to bring him to stay for the time being and leave after some time.
 After walking out of the Great Dao Tower, Qin Ling couldn’t help but say, “Grandmaster, why don’t you cultivate with me? The Heavenly Dao is running out now. With your cultivation level, it’s very difficult for you to have any opportunities in the Heavenly Dao.”
 The patrolling soldiers passing by bowed to Qin Ling. It was enough to show his status.
 Han Yu took in everything and smiled. “I know, but I’m not someone who likes to take risks. I’ll stay in the Heavenly Dao and obediently protect Buzhou Divine Mountain. I don’t ask for the Sage position, but for longevity in peace.” Qin Ling hesitated.
 All the words turned into a sigh in his heart.
 Everyone had their own ambitions.
 Cultivating was not the only direction.
 Ten thousand years later.
 Han Jue opened his eyes.
 Seeing that Li Xuan’ao and Dao Comprehension Sword were waiting outside the Hundred Peak Immortal River, he moved them inside.
 “This is not a good idea. I can’t let them wait every time.”
 Han Jue thought silently.
 Then, he raised his hand and waved. He created a clone that was especially used to handle visitors.
 The clone was him. As long as he did not develop independent thoughts, he would not be rejected by the system.
 This clone was not too strong. It was only a wisp of Han Jue’s soul.
 Han Jue made him stay in a corner of the Daoist temple. The Strange Deity was attracted by the clone and immediately came over to wrap around it.
 The Strange Deity shared the same life as Han Jue. Now, it also had strength close to a Great Dao Sage. Of course, it was only close. It had to work hard if it wanted to attain the Great Dao. The Great Dao Realm was not so easy to attain.
 It was probably its current limit. It would be very difficult for it to improve in the future. This was the rule of the Great Dao.
 Soon, Li Xuan’ao came to visit.
 Han Jue let him in. Without waiting for him to speak, he said, “You don’t have to tell me about the development of the Hidden Sect. I can see it all. You have learned to be a leader.”
 Li Xuan’ao was overjoyed when he heard that. He hurriedly said humbly, “No, no. You’re the absolute ruler.”
 Han Jue didn’t reply. He was no longer interested in the Hidden Sect. He couldn’t be bothered as long as it was on the right track.
 Li Xuan’ao gritted his teeth and said, “Sect Master, I came here for something.”
 “Tell me.”
 “I want to attain the Dao!”
 Li Xuan’ao immediately felt relieved after saying that.
 Han Jue stared at him and didn’t speak immediately.
 Li Xuan’ao braced himself and said, “Now, there are more and more Heavenly Dao Sages. It’s the same for Pseudo-Sages and Zenith Heaven Golden Immortals. If my cultivation level is low, many things will be a restriction.”
 He felt danger.
 Han Jue said, “Okay, this will be determined in the future.”
 Li Xuan’ao was overjoyed again and hurriedly thanked him.
  Han Jue waved his hand, and Li Xuan’ao immediately went out.
 He thought for a moment and told his clone to go to the Fusang Tree. If a disciple wanted to go out, he could just go to the Fusang Tree and not disturb his cultivation time and time again.
 The clone left, and so did the Strange Deity. Looking at the Strange Deity, Han Jue suddenly sighed.
 After so many years, the Strange Deity had also gained a certain level of intelligence, but no one could see it. It had always been lonely.
 Should he let it out?
 In the past, it was afraid that it would be devoured by the Inauspicious Evil. Now, there was no need to worry.
 How many were its match among the Inauspicious Evil?
 “I’ll see after some time. I’ll break through first.”
 Then, Han Jue closed his eyes and continued cultivating.
 8,405 years later, Han Jue successfully broke through!
 As he consolidated his cultivation, he checked his attributes panel.

 It had been nearly 400,000 years since his last breakthrough!
 The Great Dao was difficult, but the further one went, the harder it became!
 Fortunately, Han Jue’s lifespan had tripled. He didn’t cultivate in vain.
 Han Jue was in a good mood after finally breaking through.
 He set a goal for himself.
 He would break through to the late-stage Great Dao Primordial Chaos Realm in a million years!
 He would reach the Great Dao Supreme Realm in ten million years!
 “Ten million years… that’s really long,” Han Jue muttered to himself. He couldn’t imagine that the Heavenly Dao Sages had experienced billions of years and their cultivation levels hadn’t changed. Wouldn’t that be crazy?
 Han Jue was filled with danger after not breaking through for hundreds of thousands of years.
 After five hundred years, Han Jue’s cultivation finally stabilized.
 He first raised all his Sword Dao Mystical Powers to the limit before cultivating the Grand Unity Aspect.
 This time, he spent two hundred years learning three hundred Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols, accumulating 849 Dharma Idols!
 His strength soared!
 Han Jue didn’t enter the simulation trial immediately. Instead, he took out the Heaven-Opening Axe and the Heavenly Dao Spirit Stone.
 He prepared to upgrade the Heaven-Opening Axe!
 He wanted to see what level surpassed a Chaotic Supreme Treasure!
 Soon, the Heaven-Opening Axe fused with the Heavenly Dao Spirit Stone, but it took time to level up. Han Jue put the Heaven-Opening Axe into the system space and waited for the upgrade to succeed.
 He took out the Book of Misfortune.
  Touching the book’s cover, Han Jue revealed a hint of nostalgia and muttered, “How many years has it been? I’ve ignored you and made you useless. Today, I’ll let you curse until you’re satisfied.”
 The Book of Misfortune seemed to sense his joy as a black light flashed across its surface.
 Han Jue started cursing the First Life Black Sovereign. Six stars of hatred. He had to be the first!
 Even if he didn’t die from the curse, he had to make the First Life Black Sovereign vigilant so that his attention would not land on him.
 The cultivation of the Great Dao Sage was cursed by the Great Dao Numinous Treasure, the Book of Misfortune. Even Han Jue could feel the surging curse power.
 It was a little terrifying!
 Han Jue began to gloat.
 First Life Black Sovereign, how many years of my lifespan can you withstand?
