 Han Jue felt weak and hurriedly chose to continue.
 A figure appeared in his mind and a message appeared in front of him.
 [Foolish Sword Sage: Perfected Great Dao Primordial Chaos Realm, Chaotic Fiendcelestial. He once fought a life and death battle with Pangu and almost died. After cultivating for countless years, he used the Sword Dao created by Laozi to attain the Great Dao Supreme Realm. He was also severely injured from challenging an ancient deity and his cultivation realm declined.]
 Han Jue secretly heaved a sigh of relief.
 So he was just a former Great Dao Supreme!
 His strength was still that of a Great Dao Sage!
  Han Jue asked in his mind, “Can I insta-kill the Foolish Sword Sage?”
 (300 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?)
 I can’t even insta-kill the Divine Robe Daoist. How can I insta-kill the Foolish Sword Sage?
 Wasn’t this wasting lifespan?
 Han Jue immediately changed the question, “Can I kill the Foolish Sword Sage?”
 (300 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 (There’s a certain possibility]
 Han Jue frowned. It was definitely possible.
 That meant that he might be killed!
 Han Jue suddenly wanted to run.
 Now that the Heavenly Dao had been broken, it could no longer be used as a protective umbrella.
 Wait.
 If the Great Dao above could break the Heavenly Dao, could the Heavenly Dao survive until today?
 Or was it that the number of Great Dao was extremely small?
 Han Jue was in a dilemma.
 In a dark domain, two figures stood side by side. In front of them was a hole of light. In the hole was a miniature image of the Heavenly Dao. They could see the Divine Robe Daoist leading the vast army forward, getting closer and closer to the Heavenly Dao. The Curse Fiendcelestial was very nervous. The person beside him was too powerful and made him uneasy.
 It was the Foolish Sword Sage.
 The Foolish Sword Sage wore a black robe. There were bones above his neck and no flesh on his face. However, he had a pair of eyes and black hair that fluttered like flames.
 Long swords floated behind him in the shape of fans. They circled around like dazzling sword flowers.
 The Foolish Sword Sage said, “So it’s Great Sage Void Soul. I thought he was already dead. Is this the backing of the Heavenly Dao?”
 Great Sage Void Soul?
 Puzzled, the Curse Fiendcelestial asked, “Did you recognize the wrong person? Han Jue only lived for a little more than 400,000 years. He seems to have a special Dao Field that can block prying and karma, so you can’t see it.”
 A hint of coldness flashed across the eyes of the Foolish Sword Sage. “Oh? He became a Great Dao Sage in 400,000 years. This child should be the reincarnation of a supreme existence.”
 Supreme?
 The Curse Fiendcelestial frowned.
 He still did not understand what kind of existence a Great Dao Sage was.
 In his opinion, the Great Dao Sage Realm was already the ceiling of the Chaos. Which side could win would depend on the strength and number of Great Dao Sages.
 Only then did he know that although the Divine Robe Daoist looked arrogant, he had actually prepared a backup plan.
 He had never heard of the Foolish Sword Sage, but he could sense that he was much stronger than the Divine Robe Daoist.
 “Han Jue’s background is indeed mysterious. No one can guess it. Only the Dao Ancestor has mentioned that he is a variable,” the Curse Fiendcelestial said carefully.
 Foolish Sword Sage scoffed. “Can the words of the Dao Ancestor be trusted? What variable? Back then, he even called himself the savior of the Great Dao.”
 The Curse Fiendcelestial was silent, not knowing how to reply because he did not understand the Dao Ancestor.
 At the same time.
 The Divine Robe Daoist had already arrived near the Heavenly Dao.
 His voice resounded throughout the Heavenly Dao.
 “I am a Great Dao Divine Spirit. The Heavenly Dao Sages are not subject to the rules of the Chaos. They even went against their superiors and killed a Divine Spirit. From today onwards, all the Heavenly Dao Sages will be executed. The Heavenly Dao will be controlled by the Hatred Race! I hope that all of you can redeem yourselves in the future!”
 With that said, all the living beings in the Heavenly Dao exploded!
 Too arrogant!
 “Too arrogant!”
 “Sages don’t follow the rules?”
 “Damn it, what Hatred Race? It’s just another Flame Race!”
 “I just want to know who is so powerful to actually kill a Divine Spirit. Is it the Divine Spirit of Chaos?”
 “Who else can it be? It must be the Divine Might Heavenly Sage. The reason why this fellow is attacking must be because he sensed the other party’s ambitions!”
 “I can’t take this lying down. Let’s go! Go to the Chaos and kill the enemy! To hell with the Hatred Race. I want to kill them until they don’t even dare to have any hatred!”
 Great Sage Void Soul arrived outside the Heavenly Dao and looked at the Divine Robe Daoist flying over from the depths of the Dark Forbidden Zone. He took a deep breath.
 His hands in his sleeves trembled slightly.
 He was timid, to begin with. This was also why he had hidden behind the thirteen Lives and secretly used his Dark Instinct during the Heavenly Court battle. He was afraid of death.
 That suppressed period was his nightmare until now.
 However, he had to listen to Han Jue.
 “Damn it, why am I so well-behaved? I’m not like the old me at all.”
 Great Sage Void Soul cursed silently. He was cursing himself. Thinking of Han Jue, he instinctively respected him and didn’t dare to have any rebellious thoughts.
 The Divine Robe Daoist waved his hand, and the ten thousand yellow leaves dispersed. They flashed and disappeared, surrounding the entire Heavenly Dao in the blink of an eye.
 The Hatred Race prepared to attack the Immortal World from all directions!
 On the shoulder of the Divine Robe Daoist, Hatred Concubine immediately flew towards Great Sage Void Soul and smiled. “Are you Han Jue?”
 Great Sage Void Soul snorted coldly and did not say anything.
 Hatred Concubine covered her mouth and laughed. Suddenly, she transformed into an endless black mist and condensed into a huge face that was several times larger than the entire Heavenly Dao. It looked down at Great Sage Void Soul.
 The Heavenly Dao was huge. Every place near the mortal world formed a universe. How vast were tens of thousands of mortal worlds connected together, let alone the Immortal World and the 33rd Heaven? Even so, they still looked short in front of Hatred Concubine.
 Great Sage Void Soul sighed. He wanted to use his Dark Instinct, but this Mystical Power required him to be stronger than the other party or have more people on his side, forming a siege.
 Now…
 He felt that it was very difficult for him to challenge the Divine Robe Daoist and Hatred Concubine alone.
 He knew his strength very well. Although he was at the late-stage Great Dao Primordial Chaos Realm, his strength was inferior to some mid-stage Great Dao Primordial Chaos Realm cultivators.
 It was Han Jue.
  His expression was cold as he gently pushed Great Sage Void Soul behind him.
 Great Sage Void Soul looked at him gratefully, relieved.
 Han Jue cursed silently. “Useless thing, useless!”
 He actually wanted Great Sage Void Soul to use his Dark Instinct to connect to the Divine Robe Daoist and Hatred Concubine. However, if that happened, he would not be able to move and might be secretly attacked by the Foolish Sword Sage.
 Hatred Concubine looked down at him and smiled teasingly. “What a handsome face. I can’t even bear to kill you. If you kneel down and beg for mercy, I’ll say…”
 Han Jue suddenly raised his palm and struck. Primordial Divine Rage!
 He had long accumulated the power of more than a hundred Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols in the Dao Field. With a strike, the Dark Forbidden Zone shook. The nearby dark space shattered and the Primordial Void appeared.
 Hatred Concubine couldn’t dodge in time and was directly drowned by Han Jue’s vast Dharmic powers, dissipating into thin air!


 on?”
 Great Sage Void Soul was extremely excited and almost clapped his hands in joy.
 He remembered this Mystical Power!
 Back then, the thirteen Lives had died from this move!
 It was the same for the Despair Dao Spirit!
 Hatred Concubine was not a Great Dao Divine Spirit. How could she withstand it?
  The Divine Robe Daoist was also shocked. Han Jue’s attack was too ruthless. He used a killing move right from the start. Furthermore, the power just now was indeed terrifying. Even he would not be able to withstand it.
 “You’re indeed very strong. No wonder you can kill the Despair Dao Spirit. However, it’s ridiculous that you want to kill the Hatred Concubine with one strike!”
 The Divine Robe Daoist looked at Han Jue and smiled mockingly.
 On the other side.
 In the mysterious space, the Curse Fiendcelestial saw Han Jue attack and said excitedly, “It’s him! He’s Han Jue!”
 The Curse Fiendcelestial didn’t know much about Han Jue, either. He only knew that he was born because of Han Jue and how long he had been born.
 He was also surprised by Han Jue’s growth speed, but he didn’t know the truth.
 “Are you confident in killing him?” the Curse Fiendcelestial asked carefully.
 The Foolish Sword Sage did not answer. His gaze was fixed on the projection of the light hole ahead.
 Heavenly Dao.
 All the Sages, Pseudo-Sages, and Zenith Heaven Golden Immortals were watching nervously. No matter how low their cultivation realm was, they couldn’t spy on this battle unless they were in the Chaotic City.
 Han Jue’s strength surprised them, but the confidence of the Divine Robe Daoist caused them to panic.
 Li Taigu stood in a Chaotic City and held his sword hilt.
 So powerful!
 His palm was already so powerful. Could his Sword Dao really reach that level?
 Even from afar, he felt the aura of death the moment Han Jue attacked.
 Han Jue’s strength made Li Taigu suddenly waver in his determination.
 At this moment.
 Hatred Concubine appeared beside the Divine Robe Daoist. Her figure condensed but quickly dissipated. She gritted her teeth and glared at Han Jue, her eyes filled with fear.
 Han Jue said expressionlessly, “She indeed has some methods. She can even survive like this. But, she won’t live for long.”
 Han Jue walked towards the two of them.
 He thought of escaping, but where could he go after leaving the Heavenly Dao? The enemies he was involved in now could no longer be avoided by hiding. Furthermore, it was not time to escape yet!
 m
 as
 Since that was the case, they would fight!
 In any case, Han Jue had a soul fragment in the Daoist temple. He could be reborn after death.
 He would just hide in the Dao Field in the worst case!
 Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols condensed again and stood above Han Jue’s head. All of them were majestic and domineering.
 Even the living beings in the Immortal World could see mighty figures when they looked up. They were like the giant gods of Pangu who had split the world apart. Their shadows hung in the sky.
 The Divine Robe Daoist smiled arrogantly. “This Mystical Power again! Did you rely on this Mystical Power to kill the Despair Dao Spirit? Very good. Today, I will break your Mystical Power and avenge the Despair Dao Spirit!”
 He walked towards Han Jue.
 He already understood that Hatred Concubine had lost the ability to fight. He didn’t know what power that strike contained that made her unable to condense her body.
 The two figures flashed. Every step crossed a distance that Immortal Realm cultivators could only cross in decades.
 They were rapidly approaching each other!
 The Heavenly Dao Sages watched nervously.
 Hatred Concubine immediately ordered, “Children! Attack the Heavenly Dao!”
 With that said, figures flew out from the ten thousand yellow leaves surrounding the Heavenly Dao. The leaders at the front had powerful auras, including the aura of the Primordial Chaos Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm.
 The battle of the Heavenly Dao immediately erupted!
 All the Heavenly Dao cultivators in Chaotic City shouted and began to form hand seals. The geniuses rushed out one after another, not afraid of death.
 At the same time!
 The Divine Robe Daoist and Han Jue were already close. More than a hundred Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols appeared above Han Jue’s head and entered his body.
 He knew why the Divine Robe Daoist gave him time. It was because the latter was also waiting for an opportunity.
 He was waiting for the time to take out that Supreme Treasure!
 Han Jue had already calculated the distance in the simulation trial. When he reached a certain distance, the Divine Robe Daoist would immediately take out a Supreme Treasure. This treasure was extremely fast. He had to attack the moment he attacked.
 Suddenly!
 The Divine Robe Daoist suddenly raised his right hand, and a strong light burst out from his sleeve.
 Han Jue’s eyes narrowed. A Fiendcelestial Dharma idol above his head suddenly raised its arm and disappeared with him.
 Substitution Fiendcelestial!
 Hatred Concubine appeared where Han Jue was!
 This was the ability to replace the Fiendcelestial. It could replace any existence with itself, no matter how far away it was.
 This Mystical Power couldn’t be used continuously, but it was enough to deal with the Daoist’s Supreme Treasure!
 Hatred Concubine was drowned by the strong light and could not move instantly.
 The Divine Robe Daoist widened his eyes in shock.
 Impossible!
 That was not speed at all!
 Even he, a perfected Great Dao Primordial Chaos Realm cultivator, could not react in time!
 Thinking of something, he subconsciously turned his head.
 Han Jue had already appeared behind him and struck his body with an unstoppable palm.
 “This palm has 480,000 years of cultivation. How many palms can you withstand?”
 Han Jue’s voice entered the Divine Robe Daoist’s ears.
 The Divine Robe Daoist was directly struck by the Primordial Divine Rage and his body exploded.
 However, his soul was protected by a strange light.
 His soul was golden!
 However, Han Jue had already seen it in the simulation trial.
 He waved his palm again. The Primordial Divine Rage needed to be accumulated, so he had no choice but to use the Grand Unity Aspect to summon Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols to besiege him.
  The Divine Robe Daoist immediately jumped into a deeper space. A long staff appeared in his hand. He turned around and swept it. The long staff actually swept out huge suns. There were countless of them, forming an endless sea of fire that wanted to drown Han Jue.
 Han Jue used the power of the Space Fiendcelestial and the Traversal Fiendcelestial to arrive behind the Divine Robe Daoist.
 “Space Great Dao! Impossible!” the Divine Robe Daoist exclaimed as he sensed the fluctuation behind him.
 More than a hundred Chaotic Fiendcelestials had already appeared behind him and looked down at him. They punched down together. This layer of space instantly shattered, and even the deeper space continued to shatter. Layer after layer of space shattered. When the Primordial Void appeared, the power of the Fiendcelestials landed on the soul body of the Divine Robe Daoist.
 Boom
 Han Jue summoned the Devour Fiendcelestial next. It opened its bloody mouth and suddenly devoured all the surrounding space fragments.


 The Divine Robe Daoist’s voice echoed in the Primordial Void. He was a Great Dao Sage. His voice lasted for a long time and did not need a medium that mortals knew.
 Han Jue immediately jumped back into the Heavenly Dao, afraid that the Foolish Sword Sage would harm it.
 The Dark Forbidden Zone on the side of the Heavenly Dao shattered. Countless spatial lightning interwove. At the edge of the Immortal World, the war between the Hatred Race and the Heavenly Dao had already erupted.
 There was no sign of the Foolish Sword Sage!
 Han Jue remained vigilant. He raised his hand and waved, sucking a black lamp into his hand. This black lamp was the Supreme Treasure that the Divine Robe Daoist had used previously. It could instantly immobilize the enemy. The Hatred Concubine was still fixed in the air and couldn’t break free.
 Seeing Han Jue appear, Hatred Concubine’s beautiful eyes widened in despair.
  Where was the Divine Robe Daoist?
 Did he escape?
 Or did he die?
 Hatred Concubine was more inclined towards the former. The two of them had only fought for a few breaths when Han Jue returned. She knew the Divine Robe Daoist very well. How could he be killed so easily?
 The Divine Robe Daoist was indeed not dead, but he was not far from death. Han Jue kept fusing the Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols to strengthen the power of the Devour Fiendcelestial and corrode the Divine Robe Daoist who was trapped in the devouring space.
 Great Sage Void Soul was extremely excited and looked at Han Jue with reverence.
 Too powerful!
 That was no ordinary Great Dao Sage. The Divine Robe Daoist and the Hatred Concubine were helpless in front of Han Jue.
 Seeing Han Jue appear, the Sages were also extremely excited. With Han Jue around, the rise of the Heavenly Dao was unstoppable!
 Han Jue kept checking his surroundings to prevent the Foolish Sword Sage from ambushing him.
 At this moment, a hoarse voice entered his ears.
 “Enter the deep space and fight me. I won’t attack the Heavenly Dao no matter who wins.”
 Han Jue cursed silently, How can you be in danger if you lose?
 He asked in his mind, “Did the Foolish Sword Sage find help to hide?”
 (300 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [No]
 Han Jue narrowed his eyes. It seemed that this fellow still had morals.
 He immediately vanished.
 His figure shuttled through layers of space and arrived at the deepest space that even a Freedom Sage could not spy on. If this space shattered, he would face the Primordial Void.
 Han Jue saw the Foolish Sword Sage.
 This fellow stood in the purple mist space, looking like an evil god.
 Foolish Sword Sage stared at him and asked, “Why can you control so many Great Dao powers?”
 Han Jue said, “It’s just a resemblance. How can the power of the Great Dao be so easy to master?”
 The Foolish Sword Sage felt that it made sense. Perhaps this was the uniqueness of Han Jue’s Mystical Power. It was extremely similar to various Great Dao.
 The swords behind him suddenly flew out for a distance, like sword flowers blooming. It was an extremely spectacular sight.
 “Come, junior. You’re very strong. Perhaps I won’t be your match if you can double the number of Dharma Idols!”
 The Foolish Sword Sage raised his right hand. In an instant, sword shadows appeared in the deep space. They were dense and surrounded Han Jue from all directions. At a glance, it was difficult to estimate how many billions there were.
 Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols condensed above Han Jue’s head. All of them were arrogant and majestic.
 Ten!
 Twenty!
 Fifty!
 Eighty!
 A hundred!
 The Foolish Sword Sage stared at him calmly, waiting for him to finish condensing all his Dharma Idols.
 “I haven’t had a satisfying battle for more than a hundred million years. Junior, don’t let me down…”
 The Foolish Sword Sage shut up before he could finish speaking.
 It was because Han Jue had summoned more than 150 Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols, and the number was still increasing!
 His heart trembled.
 This kid didn’t use his full strength when facing the Divine Robe Daoist just now?
 The Foolish Sword Sage was silent and still did not attack.
 Han Jue had summoned more than 200 Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols, and the number was still increasing.
  230!
 250!
 280!
 300!
 The Foolish Sword Sage’s gaze changed. He couldn’t help but ask, “Who are you?”
 A nobody?
 The Foolish Sword Sage fell silent again.
 Seeing that Han Jue’s number of Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols had increased to 350, he couldn’t take it anymore and asked, “Is there no limit to your Mystical Power?”
 Han Jue said, “I’m almost there.”
 The Foolish Sword Sage snorted and immediately waved his hand. Countless sword shadows attacked Han Jue from all directions.
 He had to fight since he was already here!
 He wasn’t even afraid of the ancient gods. How could he be afraid of Han Jue!
 He had waited previously because he was arrogant. Now, he attacked because he was not brainless!
 It would be terrible if Han Jue accumulated more Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols!
 The three hundred plus Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols quickly dispersed. They roared and attacked, scattering the sword shadows that came from all directions.
 Space shook violently and shattered!
 Taking advantage of the appearance of the spatial fragment, Han Jue took out the Primordial Judgment Sword and used the Ten Thousand Life Sword!
 Great Dao Mystical Power!
 All the spatial fragments transformed into sword shadows and attacked the Foolish Sword Sage.
 “Sword Dao Mystical Power!”
 The Foolish Sword Sage’s eyes emitted a cold light. He didn’t expect Han Jue to also be a sword cultivator.
 This Mystical Power was similar to the Mystical Power he had just used. Their realms were both Great Dao Mystical Powers!
 The Foolish Sword Sage pulled out two swords from his waist. As the blades collided, the billions of sword shadows formed by the Ten Thousand Life Sword shattered.
 He suddenly appeared in front of Han Jue and slashed with his sword!
 So fast!
 The sword Qi landed on Han Jue and was blocked by the Time Dao Robe!
 The Time Dao Robe was a Chaotic Defensive Supreme Treasure that could resist Great Dao attacks, and the Foolish Sword Sage himself was at the Great Dao level!
 However, although this robe was strong, it couldn’t resist the Great Dao-level attacks for long. This was also the reason why he would lose in the simulation trial. He had Supreme Treasures, and so did those Great Dao Sages!
 Han Jue disappeared and appeared where he was. Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols entered his body crazily.
 The Foolish Sword Sage knew that he was fusing powers and immediately raised his two swords, forming a cross in front of him.
 A sword light burst out from his body, illuminating the entire deep space.
 In an instant! The entire deep space had changed! As far as the eye could see, there were swords everywhere. Far away, the sword shadows overlapped into a spatial wall. The blades reflected countless figures of Han Jue.
 Han Jue clearly felt killing intent everywhere. If he was not careful, his body and soul might be instantly destroyed.
 This fellow was something!
 However!
 In front of absolute power, all Mystical Powers were useless!
 More than three hundred Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols fused into Han Jue’s body. The Sword Domain began to shrink, and countless sword tips attacked Han Jue.
 He raised his sword and slashed. The Primordial Divine Rage’s power fused into the Primordial Judgment Sword.
 A sweep of the sword!
 Boom
  The Sword Domain shattered!
 About to attack Han Jue, the Foolish Sword Sage was hit by terrifying Dharmic powers. He subconsciously raised his sword to block, but his body was drowned.
 Han Jue’s sword Qi directly shattered this deep space and entered the depths of the Primordial Void. The various layers of space along the way shattered one after another without any resistance.
 When the Foolish Sword Sage condensed his body again, he discovered that another Dharma idol condensed above Han Jue’s head at an extremely fast speed.
 It was this move again!
 The Foolish Sword Sage was shocked and furious.
 He was shocked because the Primordial Divine Rage was too terrifying. He couldn’t block it at all!
 He was furious that he might be defeated by the other party’s unchanged move!


 Han Jue didn’t know the shock in the Foolish Sword Sage’s heart. Even if he knew, he wouldn’t care.
 Since the battle had begun, he would fight to the death!
 The other party was an intruder!
 Han Jue didn’t feel any psychological burden. The Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols kept condensing above his head and entering his body.
 The Foolish Sword Sage took out his two swords and crossed his legs to attack Han Jue, forming two spiraling sword Qi.
 Han Jue dodged easily, but the two sword Qi circled around and attacked him again.
 Most importantly, the end of the sword Qi did not dissipate, as if two lines had been stretched.
  After dodging several times, the sword Qi formed several circles around Han Jue.
 “How fancy!”
 Han Jue suddenly looked at the Foolish Sword Sage.
 Space twisted violently!
 Foolish Sword Sage’s pupils constricted as he cursed. “Space Great Dao! Is it really just similar?”
 His body directly vanished into thin air, turning into countless clones that covered the Primordial Void.
 Han Jue appeared and moved again.
 This time, he no longer used the power of the Space Fiendcelestial but the Traversal Fiendcelestial.
 It was invisible and silent!
 Han Jue used the power of the Exposure Fiendcelestial to quickly see through the Foolish Sword Sage’s true body and appeared behind him.
 The Foolish Sword Sage was still teasing Han Jue, wanting to see his reaction.
 No one had seen through this move of his. Previously, he could rely on this move to last for a period of time even when facing an ancient god.
 Suddenly feeling something, he subconsciously turned his head.
 “It’s too late!”
 Han Jue’s voice entered his ears clearly. He only saw his left palm hitting him from the corner of his eye.
 Primordial Divine Rage!
 Divine Rage that contained the power of four hundred Fiendcelestials!
 It was even stronger than the Primordial Divine Rage used earlier!
 The Foolish Sword Sage’s main body was instantly destroyed by Han Jue’s great Dharmic powers. The billions of clones dissipated.
 Almost instantly, Han Jue condensed the Fiendcelestial Dharma Idol again and continued to use the Dharma Idol Fusion Technique.
 Great Dao Sages had endless Dharmic powers. Not to mention Han Jue, even the Foolish Sword Sage was the same. If he wanted to kill the enemy, it still depended on the profundity of the Mystical Power and the strength of his Dharmic powers.
 As the Primordial Divine Rage dispersed, the Foolish Sword Sage appeared in the distance, leaving only his soul body that was difficult to recover.
 He looked at Han Jue in shock.
 ‘I’ll take your life while you’re injured!
 Han Jue pressed forward again. The power of time sped up the fusion of his Fiendcelestials. Just as he appeared in front of the Foolish Sword Sage, he had already fused with dozens of Fiendcelestial powers.
 He struck out with his left palm again!
 The Foolish Sword Sage was frozen by the power of the Imprisonment Fiendcelestial. There was also the power of the Great Dao of Space around him. He couldn’t move at all!
 Boom
 His palm struck, and his Dharmic powers crossed the Primordial Void!
 Foolish Sword Sage’s soul dissipated!
 Han Jue couldn’t sense his aura and immediately checked his surroundings. There was no information about the Foolish Sword Sage!
 Was he dead?
 Han Jue raised his eyebrows. At this moment, a line of words appeared in front of him.
 [Foolish Sword Sage has developed hatred towards you. Current Hatred Points: 2 stars]
 Han Jue raised his eyebrows.
 That made sense. He was not a Great Dao Divine Spirit. He had suffered in the past and would definitely hold back.
 Han Jue immediately jumped back to the Heavenly Dao.
 Hatred Concubine was still frozen and could not move.
 Seeing Han Jue appear again, Hatred Concubine panicked.
  She didn’t know who Han Jue had gone to deal with just now, but it ended so quickly. It was obvious that the other party didn’t pose a threat to him at all.
 “Please let me go. I was wrong! I’m willing to be a slave! I…”
 Hate Concubine begged for mercy incoherently.
 Clearly, she had been careless and had no way out. If this body died, she would also die.
 (Hatred Concubine has developed hatred towards you. Current Hatred Points: 6 stars]
 Han Jue sighed secretly.
 If not for the system, he wouldn’t have noticed the change in Hatred Concubine’s emotions. After all, they were at the same realm.
 What a pity!
 Han Jue fused with the power of the Fiendcelestial again. Looking at the Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols that kept flashing above his head, she felt despair and begged for mercy.
 Han Jue said expressionlessly, “I might spare you in another situation, but you invaded the Heavenly Dao. I have to destroy you and intimidate the Chaos.
 “The Hatred Race will also die with you!”
 With that, Han Jue struck out with his palm.
 The Primordial Divine Rage fused with the power of dozens of Fiendcelestials was enough to kill Hatred Concubine!
 Boom
 His Dharmic powers swept out and vanished into the depths of the Dark Forbidden Zone. A spatial crack tore along the way. It was even wider and brighter than the Chaotic Heavenly Road.
 Han Jue checked his surroundings again. After confirming that there were no powerful enemies, he jumped back into the temple.
 The Sages were stunned. Before they could recover, everything happened too quickly!
 “All Sages, kill the Hatred Race immediately! Don’t let any spirit go!”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du’s voice resounded in the Heavenly Dao. His tone was cold. Even mortals could feel his killing intent.
 Great Sage Void Soul immediately attacked. He had lost too much face previously and had to regain it.
 Without the Divine Robe Daoist and the Hatred Concubine, the next step was a one-sided slaughter.
 In the mysterious space.
 The Curse Fiendcelestial trembled and muttered, “I knew it… I knew it…”
 He didn’t hate the Divine Robe Daoist. In his opinion, the Divine Robe Daoist had already calculated everything and had endless backup plans. However, Han Jue was too powerful.
 Before absolute strength, any schemes were futile.
 The Curse Fiendcelestial sighed and left, quickly disappearing into the darkness.
 On the other side.
 Han Jue landed on the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus.
 In his interpersonal relationships, Hatred Concubine’s portrait had already disappeared. He had to kill Hatred Concubine in public as a warning. Probably many mighty figures in the Chaos were spying on them. Hatred Concubine’s death could intimidate them!
 WZ
 However, he could keep the Divine Robe Daoist.
 At this moment, the Divine Robe Daoist’s soul was still struggling in the inner space of the Devour Fiendcelestial. He was already extremely weak and couldn’t last much longer.
 Han Jue immediately entered the devouring space and used the Great Change Sealing Palm to seal the Divine Robe Daoist. Then, he brought him out and threw him into the Primordial Heavenly Prison.
 Suddenly thinking of something, he asked in his mind, “If the Divine Robe Daoist submits to me, will some existence sense the existence of the Primordial Heavenly Prison?”
 Han Jue was hated after Qiu Xilai was enslaved. He had to be wary.
 The Primordial Heavenly Prison was definitely the most terrifying function in the Dao Field. The consequences would be unimaginable once it was exposed.
 (200 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [No, the Great Dao Divine Spirit is not restricted.]
 Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief.
  What it meant was that no stronger person had left any methods in the Divine Robe Daoist’s body.
 The Divine Robe Daoist had already jumped out of the role of a pawn.
 Han Jue looked at the Divine Robe Daoist and suddenly felt that he was amiable.
 With this fellow and Great Sage Void Soul around, Han Jue wouldn’t need to take action even if the Heavenly Dao had enemies in the future.
 He could finally cultivate in peace and wait for the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity to arrive.
 At this moment…
 [Foolish Sword Sage sent you a dream. Do you accept?]
 Han Jue ignored him, afraid that the Divine Robe Daoist would suddenly wake up. He had to guard it strictly.


 After ignoring the Foolish Sword Sage, Han Jue suddenly thought of a question.
 “The Great Dao Divine Spirit is not restricted. Can the Primordial Heavenly Prison enslave him?”
 [Yes, because of you, the system has already surpassed him.]
 Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief.
 It seemed that the system was still the best. It was even more ferocious than the Great Dao.
 Han Jue thought of something else.
 [The system has detected that the current crisis is not enough to threaten you or affect the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity, so it cannot trigger the choice.]
 Han Jue was helpless.
 Was it all because he was too strong?
 At this moment.
 [Foolish Sword Sage sent you a dream. Do you accept?]
 Again?
 Han Jue frowned and thought for a moment. He still accepted it lest he missed important information. However, before that, he sent out a clone to monitor the Divine Robe Daoist in the Primordial Heavenly Prison.
 “I want to know if it’s dangerous to accept this dream?” Han Jue asked in his mind. The other party was not an ordinary person and could be considered the strongest person he had encountered so far. As for the Dao Ancestor, Pangu, the Chaotic Deities, and the Holy Mother of Order, he had only heard of them.
 (300 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [No]
 Han Jue chose to accept the dream.
 After entering the dream, he appeared in the Primordial Void. A figure stood in front of him. It was the Foolish Sword Sage.
 Han Jue didn’t know what to say.
 Threaten?
 Taunt?
 That was meaningless.
 Beg for mercy?
 nu
 Bah, what logic was that?
 Speaking of which, Han Jue had never lost in this life.
 It was because he was cautious enough not to fight without confidence.
 The Foolish Sword Sage took a deep breath and said, “You’re very strong. I’ve never met an existence like you. You’re definitely invincible among your peers.”
 Han Jue said, “You’re also very strong. In the same realm, no one has ever given me such pressure. I tried my best to defeat you.”
 а
 The Foolish Sword Sage snorted. “Defeat is defeat. I can afford to lose. I didn’t send you a dream this time to say anything harsh. Since you killed the Divine Robe Daoist, there’s no grudge between us. I’ll challenge you again in the future. Perhaps after defeating you, I’ll have a chance to avenge myself.”
 “You! You’ve already killed two Great Dao Divine Spirits.” The Foolish Sword Sage snapped.
 The Foolish Sword Sage said, “To borrow the words of you humans, the human heart is unfathomable. It’s the same for deities. If they want to restrain the Chaos, they have to rely on powerful strength. In the past, the Great Dao Divine Spirits were like what you said. They cultivated in peace and did not cause trouble until they encountered a Chaotic Fiendcelestial.”
 “Who?”
  “Pangu.”
 IL11
 Han Jue was silent.
 So that was the case. No wonder the Great Dao Divine Spirit was afraid of the Heavenly Dao.
 The Foolish Sword Sage continued, “In order to prevent Pangu from reviving, the Great Dao Divine Spirits had once joined forces to deal with the Heavenly Dao. However, they were stopped by the Dao Ancestor. He promised that he would never let the Heavenly Dao be too powerful. He begged the Divine Spirits to leave the Heavenly Dao alive. This order lasted for countless years. In the long years, many mighty figures were born until the Dao Ancestor disappeared. Then, you appeared.”
 Han Jue showed a frown.
 In that case, the current calamity of the Heavenly Dao was his fault?
 Ridiculous!
 Foolish Sword Sage changed the topic. “Let’s not talk about this. I just want to know what Mystical Power you used earlier?”
 Han Jue said, “Heavenly Dao Justice.”
 “Heavenly Dao Justice…” the Foolish Sword Sage muttered to himself and pondered.
 Han Jue was afraid that he would play tricks, so he didn’t reveal the technique’s true name.
 Powerful figures could not only deduce karma, but also Mystical Powers.
 This was the meaning of a name.
 A name was a symbol of an individual existence!
 Han Jue asked, “Can you tell me how many Great Dao Divine Spirits there are in the Chaos and how many Great Dao Supremes exist?” he asked, seeing that the Foolish Sword Sage was not stubborn.
 He knew too little about the Chaos. Previously, when he asked Great Sage Void Soul, this fellow had been suppressed for a long time and was also very unfamiliar with the world. As for the others, they were all weaker than Han Jue.
 Foolish Sword Sage looked at him deeply and said, “There aren’t many Great Dao Divine Spirits, no more than twenty. Furthermore, they each guard a Chaotic Domain. After the Divine Robe Daoist died, a new Great Dao Divine Spirit will naturally be born or be supervised by other Great Dao Divine Spirits. As for the Great Dao Supremes, they’re extremely rare. There are no more than two of them that I know of. They are all hidden existences and rarely appear in billions of years.
 “You don’t have to worry. Previously, the Holy Mother of Order attacked because she was giving the Divine Robe Daoist face. I’m the same. It’s just karma that I owed in the past.”
 Han Jue narrowed his eyes and asked, “Is the Great Dao Supreme the strongest existence?”
 Foolish Sword Sage said proudly, “That’s right. That’s the case in terms of cultivation realm. Legend has it that there are existences like the Chaotic Deities, but that’s only a legend. In any case, I’ve never seen them before. You don’t have to be too careful. After today’s battle ends, no one will dare to disturb the Heavenly Dao unless the Great Dao Divine Spirits join forces. However, there are also conflicts between the Great Dao Divine Spirits. How can they join forces? The Divine Robe Daoist and the Despair Dao Spirit were also enemies. They were just using the excuse of killing you.”
 I see.
 Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief. He was really afraid of falling into endless conflict.
 He thought of another question, “There are also Great Dao Divine Spirits in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End. Why don’t they control the nearby domains?”.
 Foolish Sword Sage thought for a moment and replied, “Perhaps it’s a new one. Its cultivation is too weak. They are both Great Dao Divine Spirits. At the same realm, lifespan is proportional to strength. There are indeed Great Dao Divine Spirits hiding in the dark, but it’s only a small number.”
 I see.
 Perhaps the Seven Dao Sage had hidden his identity as a Great Dao Divine Spirit. He had grasped the power of seven Great Dao and was indeed extraordinary. Unfortunately, he had encountered Han Jue in advance.
 The two of them chatted for a while more until the dream ended.
 (Foolish Sword Sage has a favorable impression of you. Current favorability: 3 stars]
 Han Jue was confused.
 This fellow was really making friends with him?
 Was he beaten into submission?
 Han Jue asked silently, “Did the Foolish Sword Sage lie in his conversation with me just now?”
 (300 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
  Continue!
 [No]
 Wow.
 This was a great guy!
 Han Jue also had a favorable impression of him.
 Since the Foolish Sword Sage was not lying, the Heavenly Dao should be stable for some time.
 Han Jue looked outside the Heavenly Dao.
 With the Great Sage Void Soul’s attack, countless living beings of the Hatred Race were annihilated. Now, the Sages had sent disciples of the various sects to clean up the battlefield. They had returned to the 33rd Heaven to repair the Heavenly Dao with Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du.
