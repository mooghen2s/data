 The Endless Era wasn’t affected after Han Jue exposed the truth to his children and disciples. They acted as if they had never been here and returned to their previous cultivation state.
 A thousand years later.
 Murong Qi was the first to move his Great Dao World close to the Ultimate Origin World and let it devour his world. He also stayed in the Great Dao World and waited.
 He would automatically obtain the Ultimate Origin Providence once his Great Dao World was devoured. The only difference was that he needed to create the Great Dao World again.
 Dao Sovereign, Jiang Yi, and Zhao Xuanyuan also followed. They moved their Great Dao Worlds closer and let the Ultimate Origin World devour them.
 Their actions caused an uproar among the mighty figures of the Endless Era.
 Were the Hidden Sect disciples so stupidly loyal to the Lord?
 At the same time, they wanted to see if the Ultimate Origin World would really devour the Great Dao Worlds.
 In less than a hundred thousand years, Murong Qi’s Great Dao World was the first to be devoured by the expanding Ultimate Origin World. This time, all the mighty figures who had created their own Great Dao Worlds panicked.
 What should they do now? They were facing the Lord!
 …
 Primordial Chaos.
 The three Primordial Fiendcelestials gathered in the hall. Chu Xiaoqi was also there. The atmosphere was silent.
 Chu Xiaoqi looked at them and wanted to say something, but he did not know what to say. When he learned that the Ultimate Origin World would devour other Great Dao Worlds, his first reaction was disbelief. Later, when he saw that Murong Qi’s Great Dao World was gone, his emotions were extremely
 He would not be where he was today if not for his grandfather. He was unwilling to give up his Great Dao World and start again.
 He had finally embarked on the path of pursuing the Dao Creator. He didn’t know if he could catch up from the beginning.
 It was said that the number of Dao Creators
 was not limitless.
 Chu Xiaoqi was still struggling after learning this.
 Han Huang sighed.
 Primordial Origin frowned. “Indeed. So far, I haven’t discovered any potential stronger than the Primordial Fiendcelestial. I’m afraid that in the entire blank domain, only the Lord’s
 potential surpasses the Primordial Fiendcelestial. Can we touch the Lord’s bloodline?”
 Han Huang asked, “Then we’ll let the Ultimate
 Seeing that they were not going against his grandfather, Chu Xiaoqi secretly heaved a sigh of relief. He smiled and said, “Good idea. Let’s immediately move the Great Dao World there.” Han Huang nodded.
 It was not only Primordial Chaos. The other
 Great Dao World Lords also had fantasies. It was mainly because the Ultimate Origin World was far enough from them.
 …
 In the Ultimate Origin World.
 Dao Sovereign, Jiang Yi, Zhao Xuanyuan, and
 Dao Heaven were recreating their Great Dao Worlds. They were going to create them close so that they could take care of each other in the
 future.
 Dao Heaven asked as he cast his spell, “Master,
 Zhao Xuanyuan opened his eyes and smiled.
 “How can it be that easy? I feel that entering
 the Ultimate Origin World is faster. Don’t you realize that this place is very different?” Dao Heaven nodded and sighed. “The Spirit Qi
 here is too abundant. I feel that I can
 Jiang Yi didn’t even open his eyes as he
 Three worlds were already condensing and
 It was the leader of the Nether Race, Han You. Han You came up and smiled. “Long time no
 Dao Sovereign and the other two turned around and smiled when they saw him.
 “I was wondering why you were gone. So you
 were here long ago?” Zhao Xuanyuan said in surprise.
 They were naturally happy to see an old friend in the Ultimate Origin World.
 Dao Heaven was very nervous. Han You’s aura
 was unfathomable, making him, a Great Dao Supreme, uneasy.
 The Ultimate Origin World was indeed filled with hidden talents. He encountered an existence that was not inferior to his master not long after he arrived.
 Han You chatted with them warmly for a while
 before bidding farewell.
 On the other side.
 Murong Qi stayed in the Great Dao World he
 recreated and discussed the Dao with the Life Fiendcelestial. They were both Fiendcelestials, so they naturally had many topics to talk about.
 The four disciples who chose to join the Ultimate Origin World were all doing well, making them even more glad about their decision.
 …
 In the third Dao Field.
 Han Jue opened his eyes. He was already 7.4
 billion years old.
 Now, every time he entered seclusion, it would
 take a billion years. He felt that time passed very quickly.
 However, it was fine to hurry up. To him, time had already lost its meaning.
 He first looked at the Ultimate Origin World.
 Dao Sovereign and the other two were already
 doing well there with Murong Qi. Their Great Dao Worlds had already been successfully reestablished and were even quickly catching up to their previous strength.
 There were already more than thirty Supreme Rules in the Ultimate Origin World. The abundance of rules could instead help a Great Dao World condense.
 At this rate, the four of them might be able to overtake the others.
 They were future Dao Creators. Dao Sovereign and the other two had the Chaotic Physique of the Heavenly Dao. In addition to the increase of
 various opportunities, their potential was already powerful and was something that all
 living beings needed to look up to. Murong Qi was even more so a Chaotic Fiendcelestial. Their potential might be inferior to the Primordial Fiendcelestial, but the potential of
 the other Dao Creators was also inferior to theirs. Han Jue’s gaze landed on Dugu Wu. This fellow was the first true Dao Creator in the Ultimate Origin World. The Life Fiendcelestial was formed by Han Jue’s Great Dao and was not a product of the Ultimate Origin World. Dugu Wu’s potential was also the strongest in
 the Ultimate Origin World, even stronger than the Primordial Fiendcelestial.
 He was already close to the Dao Creator Realm. The Life Fiendcelestial was stuck on the fifth Supreme Rule and was about to be overtaken by him.
 Compared to the Life Fiendcelestial, Han Jue looked forward to Dugu Wu more. This fellow’s final destination represented how
 deep the foundation of the Ultimate Origin World was. Han Jue looked away after a while. He didn’t need to worry about this kid for now.
 He didn’t encounter any bottlenecks on the
 sailing.
 Han Jue began to check his emails. They recorded what happened in a billion years, hoping that something would happen that interested him slightly.


 Space-time Avatar.]
 [Your daughter Han Ling has received guidance from a transcendent existence. Her cultivation has increased.]
 [Your grandson Han Liang received guidance from a transcendent existence and created the third Supreme Rule. His cultivation has increased greatly.]
 [Your good friend Ultimate God of Punishment was attacked by your enemy, the Primordial Ancestor God.]
 [Your good friend Ninth Chaos has
 …
 After reading the emails, he suddenly had an idea.
 Should he support a few gods, just like how the Ninth Chaos established the Chaotic Deities?
 Sure, let’s have some fun.
 Han Jue immediately sent a voice transmission
 to Han Ling and Li Daokong.
 The two of them were moved into the Daoist temple by him and hurriedly knelt down.
 “Greetings, Father.”
 “Greetings, Lord.”
 Han Ling was fine, but Li Daokong was a little excited. He had not seen Han Jue’s main body for billions of years and was naturally looking forward to it.
 Han Jue wouldn’t call for him for no reason.
 After sizing up the two of them for a while, Han Jue chuckled and said, “I plan to give you the Divine Authority and make you gods of the Endless Era. Ling’er, you are in charge of supervising the order. Li Daokong, you focus on killing. You will be the endless gods in the future.”
 With that, divine light emitted from the two of them. They were pleasantly surprised to sense the power in their bodies.
 This power…
 It was indescribable, but it was abnormally powerful. It even made them feel that they could do everything.
 Han Ling was the most shocked. She was
 already on the path of pursuing the Dao Creator Realm and thought that she was not far from it, but the Divine Authority her father had casually given her was actually so powerful. The two of them looked at Han Jue excitedly. He waved his hand and sent them out.
 He didn’t tell all living beings directly about their Divine Authority and let them prove it themselves.
 Lord. Not only was he stronger than a Dao Creator, but he could also control the Divine Authority and set the rules.
 In front of the Creator Lord, everything could be defined and overturned.
 interesting.
 The current Endless Era was too stubborn. Even the Great Dao Sages could see who could
 someone could break through this settlement.
 Of course, he could also not do anything.
 It depended on his thoughts.
 The meaning of survival of an invincible person depended on himself. What he wanted was to be the variable of all existence.
 No one could guess what the Lord was thinking. Everything was only meaningful when no one knew how strong the Lord was.
 Just like how to mortals, there were unpredictable situations in the world. Only when the path of life was filled with variables
 was it worth taking a trip. Different lives
 gathered into a world and formed civilization and consciousness.
 Han Jue’s height meant that he had the ability
 to fill everything with variables. The possibility of being abandoned by him was cruel, but how could the one he created not have any merit?
 Han Jue looked at the Divine Authority System he had thrown on the mortal world.
 The Divine Authority System had changed
 more than a hundred thousand masters over billions of years. The current master had finally reached the Great Dao Sage Realm.
 This person’s name was Xu Qiudao. He was born to seek the Dao and was simply another Han Jue. He had very little karma and hid when he encountered trouble. Everything focused on him. He didn’t even have a Dao Companion.
 Xu Qiudao was currently in the Primordial Chaos. The three Primordial Fiendcelestials never dreamed that the opportunity they had once pursued had already arrived in their Great
 Dao World.
 They rarely showed themselves after they
 became Dao Creators, so they didn’t discover Xu Qiudao at all.
 Many people of the Primordial Chaos could
 Creator, they could not deduce it. They could only deduce that the future Dao Creator had grown to the stage of Great Dao Supreme. What was the difference between this and other Great Dao Supremes?
 “Xu Qiudao, Xu Qiudao, then I’ll let you be this
 Primordial Chaos, a great world, an Immortal
 World.
 Xu Qiudao, who was in seclusion in the Daoist
 temple, suddenly sensed something and opened his eyes.
 He looked at his hands and said excitedly, “I understand! I understand!”
 He asked in a low voice, “System, have I already created a cultivation technique that can reach the Great Dao Supreme Realm?”
 [A million years of lifespan will be deducted.
 Do you want to continue?] Xu Qiudao immediately chose to continue as he
 looked at the line of words in front of him.
 [Yes]
 Xu Qiudao was even more excited. He had indeed not misjudged himself. He was still a genius even without the Divine Authority System’s help.
 Of course, it was better to have it than not! Xu Qiudao calmed down and started cultivating according to the new cultivation technique. Boom-
 A terrifying aura erupted and directly rushed to
 the top of the Daoist temple, shattering the sky of the Immortal World. The void appeared in the sky, like the abyssal mouth of a Primordial Beast wanting to devour the world. Xu Qiudao was moved and knew that something was wrong.
 This cultivation technique was too domineering. It would definitely attract the covetous eyes of many mighty figures!
 Xu Qiudao immediately fled, not even bothering to cultivate anymore.
 Just as he left, a few figures appeared in the
 air, including Chu Xiaoqi.
 Chu Xiaoqi glanced in a direction. He could see
 Xu Qiudao traveling through space and time,
 but he did not chase after him.
 “So afraid? This child is really interesting.” Chu Xiaoqi counted with his fingers and knew
 that Xu Qiudao had met with a fortuitous encounter. He had encountered such a situation before, but what made him not know
 whether to laugh or cry was that Xu Qiudao was afraid of being discovered. Didn’t he know that the Primordial Chaos would treat geniuses well?
 Chu Xiaoqi did not remind him. He wanted to
 see how long Xu Qiudao could last in fear.
 …
 In the Daoist temple.
 Han Jue watched Xu Qiudao escape and smiled.
 Not bad, it was very similar to his youth. Unfortunately, Xu Qiudao didn’t have a Dao
 Field. Otherwise, he could be more stable than him.
 Han Jue looked forward to Xu Qiudao’s performance even more now. He wasn’t worried that Xu Qiudao would threaten him. The Divine Authority System was not formed by his system at all. It was only a Great Dao
 Providence Divine Authority in the Ultimate Origin World. How could the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority devour the Lord of the Great Dao World?


 Xu Qiudao fled for hundreds of years before continuing to hide in a corner of the Primordial Chaos and cultivate in peace.
 He had too little karma. No one was targeting him, but he still felt that the world might be filled with malice towards him, so he was extremely careful.
 Just like that, Xu Qiudao was immersed in seclusion. His cultivation became even smoother after receiving Han Jue’s gift.
 A hundred million years later, he stepped into the Great Dao Supreme Realm and could finally not hide anymore. Being paid attention to by the Primordial mighty figures, he had no choice but to interact with them.
 Another billion years passed. Han Jue woke up from his seclusion again.
 Time passed peacefully. How boring.
 For a time, the Endless Era stirred up a trend of chasing after the gods.
 Han Jue had no intention of choosing more Endless Gods for now. Even if he did, he would choose from among the disciples, such as Jiang Jueshi, Zhou Fan, Xun Chang’an, Tu Ling’er, Chu Shiren, and others.
 Xu Qiudao was already considered an opportunity he had given to outsiders. It was impossible for him to promote more living beings that had nothing to do with him. Besides, the Ultimate Origin World would replace the blank domain in the future.
 Han Jue’s gaze landed on the Ultimate Origin World.
 The Ultimate Origin World expanded faster and faster, already reaching a terrifying level. However, it would still take a long time for it to
 replace the endless blank domain.
 Perhaps the Ultimate Origin World could
 replace the blank domain after Han Jue condensed the Ultimate Origin Great Creation.
 The blank domain was too big, more than a trevigintillion times larger than the current Endless Era. Words could not describe the vast difference.
 Han Jue noticed that some mighty figures had already begun to secretly befriend each other, wanting to resist the Ultimate Origin World in the future, including some of his disciples and descendants.
 Han Jue was not angry. Instead, he was excited.
 time.
 According to his predictions, those guys probably wouldn’t dare to challenge him before the Ultimate Origin World approached the
 center of the Endless Era.
 They would only make a move when they had
 no other choice.
 Han Jue looked forward to it.
 He only wanted to have fun fighting all living
 beings.
 Han Jue’s only kindness to them was to try his best to preserve the living beings of the various worlds and transform them into Ultimate
 Origin Lifeforms after the Ultimate Origin World devoured the various Great Dao Worlds.
 To all living beings, it was the same no matter where they lived. However, they always wanted to surpass him.
 Han Jue’s potential was a few major levels
 higher than theirs. His cultivation realm was also the highest and he cultivated diligently. It was basically impossible for him to be surpassed.
 “Sigh, boring years. I can only observe all living beings.”
 Han Jue sighed. When there was no goal, there
 was actually no point in living. Fortunately, his goal was only to live.
 Then, something happened. Han Huang came
 to visit.
 Han Jue thought it would take longer for him to
 quickly.
 He calculated. So he was here for Xu Qiudao.
 Xu Qiudao’s Divine Authority System had
 already been exposed. As a Dao Creator, Han Huang could naturally sense his Great Dao World. The Divine Authority System was not isolated by a Dao Field.
 Soon, Han Huang entered the temple.
 He bowed respectfully to Han Jue. “Ask,” Han Jue said with a smile, but his smile
 He felt that his father had definitely sensed
 that he did not want to join the Ultimate Origin World. He even sensed that someone wanted to resist the Ultimate Origin World, but his father did not care.
 Thinking about it carefully, it made sense. Ever
 since he was young, no matter how he messed around, his father had never blamed him.
 Han Huang adjusted his state of mind and expressed his confusion.
 “That’s right. What Xu Qiudao obtained was that Great Dao Providence Divine Authority. This Divine Authority has already had many owners. Previously, it had appeared in the Heavenly Dao, the Dao Mystic Realm, the Creation Emperor Court, and so on. Unfortunately, those previous owners died halfway.”
 Han Jue smiled.
 Han Huang heaved a sigh of relief when he
 heard this. He couldn’t see through Xu Qiudao’s opportunity, but he was a Dao Creator. The one he could not see through was
 his father, so he wanted to ask first. If his father denied it, he would have no choice but to
 help. No one could allow something to make him uneasy in their Great Dao World.
 Han Huang asked, “Father, your attitude towards him is…”
 Han Jue smiled. “Up to you.”
 Han Huang was silent.
 These words were worth thinking about.
 Han Jue suddenly asked, “Have you consolidated your cultivation?” Han Huang straightened and smiled. “Yes, I’ve sparred with Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction Venerable. I barely have the upper
 hand.”
 He hesitated for a moment and said, “Alright, since it’s a spar, Father, go all out.”
 Han Jue smiled and nodded. The father and son
 entered the simulation trial.
 On the other side.
 The Primordial Chaos changed. The three
 thousand Great Dao trembled. The light and
 darkness of the Supreme Rules changed. The turbulence of the rules caused the Primordial Space-time to collapse and many worlds were
 destroyed.
 Primordial Origin and Huang Zuntian immediately appeared to stabilize the Primordial Rule.
 “What’s going on?” Primordial Origin asked in
 Huang Zuntian frowned. “It’s Han Huang. Something happened to him. But he went to the Lord’s Dao Field. How can something happen…”
 Primordial Origin’s expression turned ugly.
 Could it be that the Lord had attacked Han Huang? They were father and son…
 However, at their realm, blood ties were no
 longer important.
 Besides, they didn’t want to join the Ultimate
 Origin World.
 Could it be that the Lord wanted to force Han
 Huang? They were a little confused. Primordial Origin
 was at a loss, while Huang Zuntian was worried that Han Jue had changed. He was loyal to Han Jue not only because he
 could read the situation, but also because he trusted him. What could he, a servant, do if Han Jue even attacked his most valued Not long after, they sensed Han Huang’s aura
 and immediately went after him.
 son?


 In the Primordial Hall.
 Han Huang sat on his lotus throne with an extremely dark expression. His hands were trembling.
 Primordial Origin and Huang Zuntian appeared in front of him.
 “What’s going on? Why is your Dao heart fluctuating so much?” Primordial Origin asked in a low voice. He heaved a sigh of relief upon seeing that Han Huang was fine.
 It was good that he was fine. This meant that the Lord was not so crazy.
 Huang Zuntian also stared at him, waiting for his answer.
 Han Huang was silent.
 After a while, he replied, “I sparred with Father.”
 Primordial Origin frowned. “Are you this upset just because you can’t win? Is that worth it? You’re definitely not his match.”
 This Han Huang was once the number one person below the Dao Creator Realm, but his temperament was actually so weak. Did he really think that he could defeat the Lord?
 “I naturally know that I can’t win, but I didn’t expect the difference to be so great. I suspect that my father has the ability to kill a Dao Creator,” Han Huang said in a low voice. “What?”
 Primordial Origin and Huang Zuntian were both moved.
 Their greatest reliance was that a Dao Creator was undying and indestructible. Even the Dao Creator killed by the Dark Forbidden Lord had revived. They were naturally not afraid of death.
 In their opinion, the Lord was only stronger than a Dao Creator, but he still couldn’t kill them.
 Han Huang’s words terrified them.
 The Dao Creator was not absolutely undying!
 Primordial Origin gritted his teeth and asked, “You didn’t make a mistake?”
 Han Huang said, “No, that pressure was too terrifying. I can’t describe it. In front of him, I feel that a Dao Creator is no different from a mortal.”
 Huang Zuntian frowned. “But Chu Xiaoqi said that the Lord has fought with the Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil. He said that he can’t kill a Dao Creator and can only seal him.”
 Han Huang asked, “Where is the seal? Who saw it? The truth is that the Dark Forbidden Lord
 has disappeared. The Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil has also disappeared. We can’t find where they are sealed.”
 The two Primordial Fiendcelestials fell silent.
 That was only what the Lord said.
 No one could see it.
 However, if the Lord could kill the Dao Creator,
 why wouldn’t he admit it?
 Could it be that he wanted to create a Dao
 Creator to reach the highest realm and hide himself in absolute invincibility?
 It was very likely!
 The more Primordial Origin thought about it,
 the more afraid he became. Fortunately, they did not directly attack the Ultimate Origin
 World.
 Huang Zuntian said, “Abandon the plan. We won’t join the Ultimate Origin World and continue cultivating. However, if the Ultimate Origin World expands in front of the Primordial Chaos, we will accept it. Let’s bet if we can find a way to reach a higher realm before that.” Han Huang nodded. Primordial Origin had no objections.
 Although they had already fused, Han Huang was the strongest. Even Han Huang was so frightened that his Dao heart almost shattered. They didn’t dare to go against the Lord
 anymore.
 How strong was the Lord?
 Han Jue’s desire to fight was aroused after
 sparring with Han Huang. He copied all the living beings in the Endless Era, including the
 Dao Creators.
 The simulation trial began!
 Challenge all living beings!
 The Ninth Chaos, the Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity, Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction Venerable, the Formless Transcendent Deity, the Chaotic Consciousness, the three Primordial Chaos, and the Dao Ancestor led all
 living beings!
 Even the Ultimate Origin World was mixed in!
 However, they were insta-killed after he used the Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal.
 Using Ultimate Origin Soul Oblivion was also an
 insta-kill.
 After several simulation trials, Han Jue began to restrain himself. He no longer used his Mystical Powers and only relied on his limbs. Even so, no one could withstand his strength. Just like that, Han Jue was immersed in the simulation trial and couldn’t extricate himself. In the Daoist temple beside him.
 Han Yunjin was greeting his mothers. “Why did your second brother leave without saying goodbye?” Li Yao suddenly asked. Han Yunjin was stunned. He had followed his second brother, but the difference in cultivation was great. He did not sense Han Huang’s departure.
 “He left? So fast? It’s only been a few breaths?”
 Han Yunjin was surprised.
 Xing Hongxuan waved her hand and said, “There’s no need to think about it. He probably
 came to spar with his father. He lost too quickly and left. Husband is always smiling, but he goes all out and shows no mercy to anyone in the simulation trial.” Han Yunjin was even more surprised. “Second
 Brother is already a Dao Creator, and he was defeated by Father so quickly? Furthermore, he didn’t even greet us. How badly did he lose?”
 Xuan Qingjun smiled. “I’ve already said that he
 will definitely surpass the Dao Creator and reach a higher realm. However, is there really a higher realm? Has he already begun to create new realm?”
 The women looked at each other and sighed at Han Jue’s strength.
 They still couldn’t understand why he was so strong. Was it just because of his cultivation attitude?
 Their cultivation years had long exceeded the
 It was definitely not an attitude. He definitely had potential!
 Han Jue’s potential had already reached an unimaginable level.
 Han Yunjin was amused. “Then I’ll challenge
 Father too. It just so happens that he’s not cultivating. In any case, no one will die in the simulation trial.”
 With that, he stood up and went to the Daoist
 temple. Xing Hongxuan wanted to persuade him
 otherwise, but Li Yao stopped her. She snorted. “Let this brat try. Otherwise, he’ll be sloppy all day and not have the bearing of an expert.” Qingluan’er covered her mouth and laughed. “How can he not have the bearing of an expert? He’s just acting like this in front of us.”
 Li Yao smiled helplessly. “Of course, I know, but it’s precisely because of this that I’m worried. It’s not wrong to work hard to increase his cultivation level.” She had the heart of an expert and had never
 given up chasing after Han Jue, so her attitude towards her son was also very strong. After a long while…
 Han Yunjin did not return, making them worry.
 Xing Hongxuan frowned. “Let’s go take a look. That kid can’t last longer than Huang’er.” Xuan Qingjun, Li Yao, and Qingluan’er also felt that it made sense and immediately headed to Han Jue’s Dao Field.
 Han Jue let them in and they saw Han Yunjin
 lying in front of him. His body was curled up
 on the ground and his arms were crossed. He was trembling. His eyes were extremely wide and terrified, like a mortal after seeing a ghost. “Do you have to do this?” Xing Hongxuan glared at Han Jue.
 He said helplessly, “I’ve already held back, but I’m the Lord, after all. He’s too weak.” Xing Hongxuan looked at Li Yao, who was
 helping Han Yunjin up. Li Yao smiled and said,
 “Perfect. This kid has never felt any danger since he was young. This time, I’ll let him know how weak he truly is.”
 Xuan Qingjun and Qingluan’er looked at each
 other helplessly.
 Han Jue was a great person to live with, but he liked to be serious with his juniors in battle. “Li Yao, stay. Put him down,” Han Jue said and
 the women immediately followed.
 Li Yao sat beside him. He smiled and asked, “You don’t blame me, right?” She shook her head. “I don’t.” Han Jue didn’t ask further. The two of them
 didn’t need to talk nonsense. He began to
 guide Li Yao in the construction of her Great
 Dao World.
 There had to be a Dao Creator among his Dao Companions. Only Li Yao had the greatest hope.
 She had already condensed five Supreme Rules
 and was getting closer and closer to the Dao
 Creator Realm, but the last two seemed so far away.


 Li Yao stayed by Han Jue’s side to cultivate. As Han Jue cultivated, he released his Creator
 Han Yunjin finally recovered after a few years and quickly left the Dao Field. After that, the disciples of the Han family discovered that their progenitor had actually begun to enter seclusion and it was very difficult to see him again.
 This was strange. In the past, Han Yunjin was seldom seen cultivating and was always busy visiting his descendants. He could be said to be the freest person in the entire Han family.
 The news of Han Huang and Han Yunjin losing to the Lord did not spread.
 Ten million years later.
 Li Yao returned to her Daoist temple. Her Great Dao World had more opportunities and
 changed endlessly, but the living beings inside did not sense it.
 Furthermore, she was not far from it!
 …
 A billion years passed quickly. Han Jue opened his eyes again.
 This time, no one looked for him.
 He observed for a while before retracting his gaze and continuing cultivating.
 He was about to reach ten billion years of age.
 Several hundred million years later, three notifications appeared in front of him.
 [Detected that you are ten billion years old and your life has taken another step forward. You have the following choices:]
 [1: Immediately destroy all the Great Dao Worlds. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment, a Creation Spirit Stone, a Primordial Fragment, and an Ultimate Origin Spirit Stone.]
 [2: Cultivate in a low-profile manner and maintain your original intention. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment, a Creation Spirit Stone, a Primordial Fragment, and an Ultimate Origin Spirit Stone.]
 [You have obtained a Creation Heaven’s Chosen attempt.]
 There was no change. The Ultimate Origin Spirit Stone was no longer useful to Han Jue, so
 he treated it as a collection.
 Han Jue silently chose the second option.
 He suddenly had an idea. Should he enter seclusion for longer a period of time?
 In any case, time was already very boring for him.
 Han Jue didn’t know when that mysterious white-haired man would be born.
 However, he didn’t have to watch him be born, even if the white-haired man was killed by him the moment he was born. In that case, would there really be no second white-haired man in the future?
 He would definitely not be able to stop it.
 Han Jue sent a voice transmission to the Dao Companions and told them that he would enter seclusion for a long time. Then, he continued his seclusion.
 He was secluded for ten billion years.
 The blank domain developed rapidly. Several Dao Creators were born in this period.
 In the Transcendent Divine Hall.
 Figures knelt in front of the door, their foreheads pressed tightly against the steps. “All of you, leave. The Dao Creator won’t attack.”
 The Formless Transcendent Deity’s voice sounded cold.
 A middle-aged man in a dragon robe looked up
 and asked in a low voice, “May I ask, Great Deity, did you tacitly agree to his actions?”
 No more sound came from the Transcendent
 Divine Hall.
 The dragon-robed man knelt for a while more before slowly standing up.
 The other figures stood up and left with him.
 “In that case, don’t blame us for risking everything!” the dragon-robed man muttered to himself. Just as he took a few steps, he
 transformed into a golden dragon that was hundreds of millions of kilometers long and flew to the end of the blank domain. The other figures also transformed into dragons and followed him.
 In the Transcendent Divine Hall.
 The Formless Transcendent Deity opened his eyes and sighed slowly.
 “The era has changed, after all. Even the Dao
 Creators will enter the calamity. I should let go.”
 A figure walked out of the darkness at this moment. It was the Ninth Chaos. The Ninth Chaos said indifferently, “The Lord is in seclusion. Several Dao Creators have been born in the past ten billion years. Many variables have also been born in the Endless Era. This is the Endless Era. The dominant era that belongs to the Dao Creators is about to
 end. Join forces with me. The five ancient Dao Creators should be united.”
 The Formless Transcendent Deity asked, “If the Lord knows…”
 “We are not against the Lord. We’re joining forces to protect ourselves. Don’t you realize that many karma that you can’t see through have already appeared in the blank domain? Only by joining forces and establishing a new order can we help the Lord maintain the Endless Era,” the Ninth Chaos interrupted him
 and continued.
 Boom!
 The Transcendent Divine Hall shook as if it was
 about to collapse. It trembled for a few breaths of time.
 The Ninth Chaos sighed. “This child is getting
 Creator.”
 “Perhaps.”
 “I promise you, we’ll join forces.”
 “Yes, wait a little longer. I’ll give you a surprise.”
 “All
 With that, the Ninth Chaos vanished and the
 hall fell silent again.
 …
 Third Dao Field.
 Han Yunjin came to visit his mothers. They
 gathered in Li Yao’s Daoist temple and chatted about the Endless Era.
 “Tsk tsk. Mother, where did Emperor Chen Ni
 Li Yao said calmly, “He’s a providence lifeform of the Endless Era. What’s protecting him is not the Dao Creators, but the core rule of the blank domain. Even the Dao Creators can’t understand it. I’m afraid only your father can kill him.”
 Xing Hongxuan sighed. “I didn’t expect that
 the opportunity I gave him back then would
 make him a scourge of the Endless Era.” Dao Comprehension Sword shook her head. “How can it be your fault? If not for you, he
 would have died long ago. Speaking of which, he even acknowledged you as his mother. Even
 you can’t dissuade him?”
 “I can’t. Although he respects me, his obsession is too deep. I can’t control him at all,” Xing Hongxuan said helplessly. The legend of the Prominent Divine Dream Mother was still spreading in the blank domain. The
 current her was the deity that all living beings respected the most. She had gathered more
 out of seclusion? This blank domain is about to be engulfed in chaos, but he can still cultivate in peace.
 Xuan Qingjun smiled faintly. “It’s just chaotic
 for us. In his eyes, it might not be troublesome at all.”
 Han Yunjin felt that it made sense and nodded.
 At this moment, they felt a vast pressure,
 startling them so much that they turned around.
 In the depths of the blank domain. Two figures were facing each other, and their
 auras had reached the extreme.
 One of them was the Primordial Fiendcelestial
 Han Huang!
 Han Huang was high and mighty. His aura clearly suppressed the other party as he looked down at him.
 The person facing him was a white-haired man in armor. His armor was embedded with bones. His face was demonic and his pupils were long and narrow, like a demon. His aura was
 especially blood-colored and extremely
 terrifying. “As expected of the former number one person
 below the Dao Creator Realm. He’s indeed
 powerful…” Emperor Chen Ni looked up at Han Huang and
 smiled crazily. He licked his lips and raised his right hand. A bone sword appeared in his hand.
