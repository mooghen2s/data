 “What do you mean? Why should I kill him?”
 Azure Heaven Mystic frowned and shook off his hand.
 His fear of the Carefree Immortal deepened.
 After living for so long, the Carefree Immortal was the existence he could not see through the most and was also the most dangerous!
 Carefree Immortal said, “The Divine Might Heavenly Sage is an anomaly and doesn’t belong to the Chaos. He stepped on many Invincible Supremes and severely affected the fate of the Chaos…”
 He spoke slowly, just like he had said to Han Huang and the other two.
 Azure Heaven Mystic fell silent.
 He was not convinced by the Carefree Immortal, but he did not know how to escape.
 Since the other party had said so, he definitely had to make a choice and not beat around the bush.
  As long as he rejected him, it would definitely be a life-and-death battle!
 The move just now was enough to show the difference in strength.
 Azure Heaven Mystic took a deep breath and said, “I thank you for your appreciation, but if I accept it, the path I want to take will be missing and will never be repaired, so I still refuse. Come, I know you won’t let me go. I only want to follow my heart even if I die!
 “The Heavenly Dao nurtured me, so I have to fight for the Heavenly Dao!”
 The smile on Carefree Immortal’s face vanished and his eyes turned cold.
 He said coldly, “In that case, don’t blame me for being impolite. I can give you the Divine Authority, and I can also take it back. Not only will I take it back, but I will also snatch your potential!”
 Azure Heaven Mystic laughed. “How can you snatch my talent!”
 Boom
 A terrifying aura erupted from Azure Heaven Mystic’s body. The divine light of the Supreme Rule burst out, causing his long hair to flutter.
 Carefree Immortal narrowed his eyes and muttered, “This aura… No… Impossible!”
 Blank Domain.
 Han Huang, Jiang Jueshi, and Han Qing’er were still floating, but more and more corpses gathered around them.
 Han Qing’er said helplessly, “Why isn’t that fellow here yet?”
 Jiang Jueshi opened his eyes and said, “I’ve already developed a perception towards the blank domain. He has indeed never appeared. It seems that my creation and Junior Huang’s potential are not so easy to absorb.”
 Han Qing’er asked, “Then should we ask Father to fetch us?”
 Jiang Jueshi said, “Let’s wait a little longer. This is a good opportunity. This person is too dangerous. We can’t let him grow. If he can snatch our potential, he can snatch the potential of others. If our potential accumulates, the consequences will be unimaginable.”
 He had obtained his current achievements because of the overlapping potential of reincarnation. He was also afraid that an enemy like him would appear.
 Furthermore, the Carefree Immortal did not need reincarnation. It was even more exaggerated than him to forcefully strip away his potential.
 Han Huang did not say anything, but his eyes were filled with anger.
 In the past hundred thousand years, other than cultivating again, his anger had also been accumulating.
 This matter alerted Han Jue. He only relaxed for a short period of time and was more ashamed.
 Before leaving the Dao Field, he had promised all sorts of things that he would definitely not cause trouble. He had even arrogantly said that not many existences in the Chaos were his match.
 He had indeed defeated countless experts in the Heavenly Court. This was the only time he had failed.
 He couldn’t accept it even if it was only once.
 The anger of revenge had already occupied Han Huang’s heart, but he did not show it. Jiang Jueshi and Han Qing’er did not sense it.
 Jiang Jueshi looked at him and asked, “Junior Huang, how’s your cultivation? Have you recovered your Great Dao?”
 Han Huang replied, “I’ve recovered, but it’s not enough.”
 Jiang Jueshi frowned. He suddenly felt that something was wrong with him.
 “Junior Huang, are you alright? Did something go wrong with your cultivation?” Jiang Jueshi asked with concern.
 Jiang Jueshi smiled and nodded. “I also have this plan. We have to stand up wherever we fall!”
 At this moment…
 “You want to deal with me?”
 Carefree Immortal’s voice sounded, his tone cold.
 The three of them turned around in shock and saw a figure flying over from the depths of the blank domain like a ghost, leaving behind afterimages.
 Carefree Immortal stopped, but the three of them widened their eyes in shock.
 A second head actually grew out of Carefree Immortal. This head was actually Azure Heaven Mystic, but Jiang Jueshi and the other two could not recognize it.
 A cold and mocking smile hung on the Carefree Immortal’s face. Azure Heaven Mystic’s expression was cold and heartless. The two faces were side by side, making people feel extremely ridiculous.
 Jiang Jueshi asked in a low voice, “Whose face is this? Did you absorb his potential?”
 Han Qing’er secretly used the Invocation Technique.
 Carefree Immortal smiled and said, “The number one prodigy of the Heavenly Dao. This kid is not simple. He almost devoured me. However, with his creation, I have already surpassed the Great Dao Supreme Realm and the previous Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit.
 “In other words, you can’t deal with me.”
 His gaze landed on Han Qing’er and he smiled. “You’re summoning your father, right? It’s just nice. I’ll surpass those existences above the Chaos if I absorb him.”
 Han Qing’er trembled.
 Han Huang snorted. “Do you know my father’s cultivation level?”
 Carefree Immortal smiled and asked, “Do you know what the cultivation level of the Great Dao Supreme is?”
 The three of them were stunned.
 Seeing this, the Carefree Immortal laughed wantonly, his tone filled with disdain.
 “I’m not sure what the cultivation level of the Great Dao Supreme is. Do enlighten me.”
 A voice came from the black vortex behind Han Qing’er. Divine light came from the vortex and Han Jue slowly stepped out.
 He activated all his Supreme Treasures, causing his aura to reach its peak.
 Han Huang and Jiang Jueshi were shocked. They had never felt such a powerful aura.
 The smile on Carefree Immortal’s face gradually disappeared. He stared at Han Jue and said, “Divine Might Heavenly Sage, it’s really better to see you than hear about you.”
 Han Jue saw Azure Heaven Mystic, but he didn’t show it.
 Wow!
 You even dare to touch the karma of the Dao Creator!
  If you don’t die, who will?
 Chaotic Consciousness, you owe me this karma!
 Han Jue smiled and asked, “Who’s behind
 you?”
 Azure Heaven Mystic shrugged. “No one. I just saw a trace of fate.”
 Han Jue sighed. “That’s all?”
 “What, you’re not satisfied?”
 “I’m sighing for you.”
 Han Jue smiled and his eyes narrowed. Jiang Jueshi and the other two moved behind him.
 Carefree Immortal smiled and said, “I didn’t only absorb the bloodlines of these three people. I also absorbed the bloodlines of more than a hundred geniuses and the power of several Chaotic Fiendcelestials. The current me has already surpassed the Great Dao Supreme Realm and reached the realm of a Dao Creator!


 Dao Creator?
 Han Jue almost wanted to laugh. If not for him asking the system as quickly as possible if he could insta-kill this person, he might really be shocked.
 However, he had spent 100 trillion years knowing that he could insta-kill the other party. This meant that the other party was not a true Dao Creator.
 This fellow was still arrogant.
 “Divine Might Heavenly Sage, have you heard of the Dao Creator Realm? A Dao Creator can create everything and is not restricted by the Chaotic Rules. He can freely wander in this blank domain. Here, the Chaotic Will can’t harm the Dao Creator!” Carefree Immortal raised his arms and said with an intoxicated expression.
 Han Jue asked, “Then if I can also wander here, won’t I be considered a Dao Creator?”
 Carefree Immortal’s expression froze.
 Han Qing’er laughed. “Father, you scared him!”
  Jiang Jueshi and Han Huang also smiled.
 Carefree Immortal sneered. “It’s not that simple. In that case, attack. Let me experience the Divine Might Heavenly Sage’s power!”
 Shadows appeared above Han Jue’s head and quickly disappeared. This was the Dharma Idol Fusion Technique.
 Carefree Immortal was not in a hurry to attack. Instead, he took out a half-moon red jade. This red jade emitted light and froze this blank domain.
 He wanted Han Jue to be unable to escape!
 The purple Qi transformed into a terrifying giant shadow that was ten million feet tall. Its figure was like a carefree immortal and was no longer double-headed. There was only one head of the Carefree Immortal, and the Azure Heaven Mystic appeared in the chest of the purple Qi giant shadow. Unlike the other struggling figures, its eyes were closed as if it had fallen asleep. Its body undulated with the purple Qi.
 The half-moon red jade flew up and landed between the Carefree Immortal’s brows, transforming into a third eye.
 “What is he doing?” Han Qing’er asked nervously.
 Han Jue didn’t answer. He couldn’t be bothered by the Carefree Immortal’s actions.
 It gave him time to fuse with the Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols.
 He blocked the black vortex to prevent the Carefree Immortal from using it to infiltrate the third Dao Field.
 “Hahaha. Divine Might Heavenly Sage, do you feel it? This vast aura, this is the Dao Creator’s Dao power. I admire you very much. Unfortunately, you are an anomaly. If the will of all living beings wants you dead, I can’t let you live!
 “Go to hell!”
 The Carefree Immortal laughed wildly and slapped at him. His ten-million-foot-tall body transformed into a purple storm that swept towards Han Jue. The surrounding corpses instantly turned into dust.
 Jiang Jueshi and Han Huang were moved. Han Qing’er’s face was pale.
 What a terrifying pressure! They had never felt such a powerful force!
 This was even stronger than Han Jue’s aura when he appeared!
 They couldn’t help but look at him.
 Han Jue’s back was facing them. No matter how the wind and waves tried to sweep them, his body didn’t tremble at all.
 The three of them suddenly felt at ease.
 With Han Jue in front, they felt infinitely safe.
 “How arrogant!”
 Han Jue’s voice sounded. Unlike before, it was cold and serious, filled with killing intent.
 The three thousand Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols gathered and formed the Ultimate Origin Power in front of him.
 The Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal emitted endless red light and crushed forward with an unstoppable force!
 Extremely fast!
 Jiang Jueshi and the other two felt a red light flash in front of them. The terrifying purple aura storm instantly exploded. Everything in front of them vanished, leaving only the blank domain.
 The Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal swept past, leaving only a head behind.
 The geniuses he had fused with were all sucked away by the Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal.
 Carefree Immortal’s eyes widened. His face trembled and his mouth twitched.
 “Impossible… I’m a Dao Creator… Impossible…” Carefree Immortal said in disbelief.
 Han Qing’er smiled. “Dao Creator? That’s it?”
 Carefree Immortal was furious. His eyes turned red as he cursed. “How dare you humiliate me! You’re courting death!”
 He condensed his body again and raised his hand to pull the half-moon red jade off his forehead. He crushed it, and the half-moon red jade turned into dust and entered his
 body.
 He suddenly disappeared. Han Qing’er felt a terrifying killing intent and was so frightened that her face turned pale.
 Han Jue suddenly raised his right hand. The Carefree Immortal revealed his true form and his throat was grabbed by his right hand.
 “You…”
 Carefree Immortal widened his eyes in shock. He gritted his teeth and asked, “You’re also a Dao Creator? Your Dharmic powers…”
 Han Jue glanced at him from the corner of his eye and said, “I don’t know what a Dao Creator is. I only know that you shouldn’t hurt my children and disciples, much less capture the juniors of the Chaos. I don’t know your name either, but it’s not important.”
 Boom
 Carefree Immortal suddenly turned to dust. An Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal flew out from Han Jue’s palm and quickly expanded.
 At first glance, the Carefree Immortal seemed to have been shattered by the Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal, scaring Jiang Jueshi and the other two.
 Han Jue quickly took away the half-moon red jade that had just recovered.
 This was an Ultimate Dao Treasure. He had to snatch it!
 Han Jue glanced at Jiang Jueshi and the other two. He used the Ultimate Origin Power to move them into the black vortex and threw them back to the third Dao Field.
 He then prepared to return.
 “Heavenly Sage, wait!”
 A voice drifted over.
 Han Jue glanced over and saw a mighty figure speeding over.
 That was…
 Holy Mother of Order!
 Han Jue had an extremely deep impression of her. An ancient deity above the Great Dao Divine Spirit had once used a drop of water to pierce through the Heavenly Dao. She had frightened him at that time.
 “Who are you?” Han Jue asked. Even if he knew, he had to pretend not to.
  The Holy Mother of Order stopped and said, “I am the Chaotic Great Dao Divine Spirit, the Holy Mother of Order. I was nearby and happened to witness the Heavenly Sage killing the Carefree Immortal. I want to talk to you about the Carefree Immortal. He’s not dead yet.”
 Carefree Immortal? The name of that thing just now?
 nan
 Han Jue asked, “Then, where is he hiding?”
 He did not receive any hatred notifications from the Carefree Immortal, nor could he sense his aura. He thought that this fellow had already died.
 The Holy Mother of Order said, “The Carefree Immortal was one of the first living beings in the Chaos. In order to be eternal, he sacrificed his cultivation and fused into the will of the Chaos to obtain the fate of freedom and immortality. He will appear every long era. His appearance means that the will of the Chaos is about to revive. I guess the will of the Chaos wants to target you. The last time the will of the Chaos awakened, it made the Dao Ancestor the enemy of all living beings.”
 Han Jue showed a frown.
 The Holy Mother of Order said, “I want to remind the Heavenly Sage that the Chaotic Will is the strongest existence. You can’t fight it head-on. The Heavenly Dao Pangu and the Dao Ancestor have both failed.”
 Han Jue narrowed his eyes and asked, “Could it be that this was the reason Pangu was besieged by three thousand Chaotic Fiendcelestials?”
 “That’s right. Although Pangu had yet to reach the Great Dao Realm at that time, the Chaotic Will only targeted the strongest in the Chaos. He would either die or submit,” the Holy Mother of Order replied, her tone unchanged.


 “If not for your appearance, the strongest person in this era should have been the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit. He would have defeated the Primordial Ancestor God and the Dao Ancestor and raised the strongest realm of the Chaos. However, your appearance changed fate and attracted the Chaotic Will’s attention.”
 The Holy Mother of Order’s tone was extremely calm, but it outlined an epic scene for him.
 Han Jue asked, “So, Holy Mother, you suggest that I surrender?”
 I can
 Han Jue remained silent.
 What nonsense!
 I can’t just give up!
  Han Jue suddenly understood.
 The Chaotic Will was a calamity for the aspiring Dao Creators.
 No wonder the Chaos had been born for so long and only had five Dao Creators.
 Han Jue asked, “Is the Dao Creator Realm mentioned by the Carefree Immortal really the realm after the Great Dao Supreme Realm?”
 reme
 The Holy Mother of Order said faintly, “There is indeed such a legend, but it’s illusory and difficult to tell if it’s true or not. I think that the Great Dao Supreme Realm is already the end of the road. In the future, it’s only a difference in strength, not cultivation realm.”
 Han Jue nodded. “Thank you for your reminder, Holy Mother. Goodbye.”
 With that, he turned around and entered the black vortex.
 The black vortex shrank until it disappeared.
 The Holy Mother of Order stood quietly in place, thinking about something.
 In the Daoist temple of the third Dao Field.
 Jiang Jueshi and the other two heaved a sigh of relief when they saw him.
 Han Jue said, “No, he will revive in the future. He has fused with the Chaotic Will and is considered undying.”
 The expressions of the three changed drastically.
 Han Jue said, “You can leave. It’s fine if you want to continue wandering the Chaos. The Carefree Immortal can’t be revived for the time being. Even if he is, the focus will be on
 me.”
 It was good to go out and adventure, lest the Chaotic Will erupt and these guys find trouble with him from the interior of the Dao Field.
 The three of them immediately bowed and left.
 Han Jue waved his hand and released all the geniuses in the Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal outside the Heavenly Dao.
 Han Jue was stunned upon seeing this notification, then he smiled in relief.
 His performance was not in vain.
 Han Jue had always said that he carried the banner of righteousness for the sake of all living beings in the Chaos ever since he faced the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit. Now that he had saved the prodigy nurtured by the Chaotic Consciousness, he naturally could obtain a favorable impression.
 Han Jue felt that his actions were impeccable.
 It could be said that he was an anomaly, but it could not be said that his sins were grave.
 “The fact that he has a favorable impression of me means that the Chaotic Will has nothing to do with him. It seems that the Dao Creators really won’t care about the Chaos unless I want to destroy it.”
 Han Jue thought silently.
  However, he remembered that the Chaotic Consciousness cared especially about the Dark Forbidden Lord. What was the reason?
 He thought for a moment and felt that he could not answer it.
 Even he, the Divine Might Heavenly Sage, had been witnessed by others and knew that it was in the Heavenly Dao.
 However, the Dark Forbidden Lord was different. He was too mysterious.
 “I’ll curse the Carefree Immortal after some time and see if I can weaken the Chaotic Will.”
 Han Jue took out the half-moon red jade.
 This jade was as big as a dagger. One could feel a soul-chilling cold as they held it.
 Han Jue first used Absolute Purification to prevent himself from being plotted against.
 Absolute Purification required time. He cultivated and waited.
 Heavenly Dao, in a palace.
 Azure Heaven Mystic sat down with an extremely ugly expression.
 He didn’t know who had saved him, but he clearly remembered his defeat at the Carefree Immortal’s hands. He had been deprived of his bloodline and creation. The pain was engraved in his heart.
 He was not afraid. Like Han Huang, his heart was filled with endless anger.
 “There can be no next time!”
 Azure Heaven Mystic clenched his fists in his sleeves.
 At this moment, a voice sounded in his mind.
 “It’s not your fault. It’s just that the other party doesn’t care about seniority or the difference in cultivation level.”
 Azure Heaven Mystic was not surprised and cursed. “But I’m not strong enough in the end! If it were the Divine Might Heavenly Sage, how could he be like this?”
 “The Divine Might Heavenly Sage’s Dao Field is a Great Creation. He has always been hiding and cultivating. Even if you want to be like him, you don’t have the Great Creation Dao Field to protect you.”
 The voice in his mind calmed him down.
 This voice appeared when Azure Heaven Mystic fused with the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority. It claimed to be his Dao heart and guided him out of the maze.
 Azure Heaven Mystic asked, “Why didn’t you help me when Carefree Immortal forced me?”
 “This is a calamity you must pass. Facing an invincible force, your choice will decide your Dao. This time, you choose not to submit. Your path of invincibility will be even more determined.”
 The voice in his mind also calmed Azure Heaven Mystic down.
 No matter what, what had happened had already happened. He could only choose and control the future.
 Azure Heaven Mystic looked at his right palm. The Great Dao Providence Divine Authority was still there.
 “One day, I won’t be in such a sorry state anymore!”
 Tens of thousands of years later.
 Han Jue, who was cultivating, was interrupted by the notification.
  [Detected that you are ten million years old and your life has taken another step forward. You have the following choices:]
 (1: Exit seclusion immediately and open the Primordial Chaos to slaughter all living beings in the Chaos. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment, a Primordial Fragment, a Creation Spirit Stone, a Supreme Treasure, a Heavenly Dao Spirit Stone, and a Great Dao Dao Dao Field guard.]
 [2: Cultivate in a low-profile manner and maintain your original intention. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment, a Primordial Fragment, a Creation Spirit Stone, and a new function of the system.]
 Han Jue showed a frown.
 Creating the Primordial Chaos required him to slaughter all living beings in the Chaos?
 He suddenly felt that the Chaotic Will was right to target him.
 Han Jue chose the second option not because he felt that he was on the wrong path, but because the first option was too dangerous.
 (You chose to cultivate in a low-profile manner and obtained a Great Dao Fragment, a Primordial Fragment, a Creation Spirit Stone, and a Supreme Treasure.]
 (Congratulations on activating a new function of the system—Creation Heaven’s Chosen]
 (Creation Heaven’s Chosen: The Primordial World has countless great opportunities. You, who have inherited the Primordial Inheritance, can activate the Creation Heaven’s Chosen. Every ten million years, a random Innate Great Creation will appear among your children. You can decide when to activate the Heaven’s Chosen. You can also accumulate the number of attempts.]


 (You currently have a Creation Heaven’s Chosen attempt. Do you want to activate it?]
 Innate Great Creation?
 Could it be an existence like Jiang Jueshi?
 Han Jue’s eyes lit up.
 This was a good function, and it only appeared among his children and would not fall into the hands of outsiders.
 However, it was not impossible for his children to betray him.
 He had to be cautious.
 It was best not to do it for the time being. He had to accumulate it for now.
  “I’ll keep it for now. I don’t have many children currently, anyway.”
 Han Jue smiled and made a decision.
 Speaking of which, he had few children.
 Han Huang and Han Qing’er had yet to marry. Han Tuo focused on cultivating and had not found a new wife for more than nine million years.
 His only hope was Han Yu. This fellow was also alone, but he had a good relationship with the female disciple beside him. However, his feelings for her were ambiguous.
 “Could it be that the Han family has to rely on me to prosper?”
 Han Jue was speechless just thinking about it.
 He decided to stop thinking and resume cultivating.
 He had to survive the calamity of the Chaotic Will.
 He closed his eyes and continued cultivating.
 Jiang Jueshi and the other two left the third Dao Field less than a year after they were saved. They returned to the Heavenly Court and began to cultivate in seclusion.
 It was the same for Azure Heaven Mystic.
 The other geniuses devoured by the Carefree Immortal returned home. As a result, the Heavenly Dao captured many allies.
 After the Sages asked about it, they guessed that the Divine Might Heavenly Sage had saved these geniuses. Therefore, they were relieved and continued to keep themselves busy.
 Time passed quickly.
 A hundred thousand years passed.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and smiled.
 His cultivation level increased again. This feeling was not bad.
 He was just afraid that his cultivation level could not increase.
 Han Jue still couldn’t figure out the realm of the Dao Creator for the time being. This meant that he was still far from it.
 Now, he could only place his hopes on the Primordial World and the Ultimate Origin Fiendcelestial.
 He first observed the Primordial World.
 Currently, more than 200 Chaotic Fiendcelestials had been born in the Primordial World from the Fiendcelestial Qi. Their cultivation levels were still shallow. They each hid in a corner and cultivated. Only two Chaotic Fiendcelestials had met and fought and became brothers.
 This made him relieved. As long as these Chaotic Fiendcelestials did not kill each other, they could control the Primordial World well.
 The Primordial World was still expanding and contained more and more nebulous Primordial Qi.
 It was strange.
 Could it be that it had yet to reach the level of transformation?
 But this made sense!
 Han Jue checked the emails after observing the Primordial World.
 [Your disciple Zhou Fan was attacked by an Inauspicious Evil) x907922 (Your good friend Foolish Sword Sage established the Sword Dao River. His providence has increased greatly.]
 (Your good friend Huang Zuntian used the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority to forge a Great Dao Supreme Treasure. His providence has increased greatly.]
 (Your good friend Li Daokong has entered the bottom of the Chaos.]
 (Your son Han Huang has entered the Chaotic River of Destiny.)
 The recent circle of friends was very lively. There were attacks, opportunities, epiphany, new map unlocking, and so on.
 The Chaos was vast and there were too many unknown places.
 Han Jue watched with relish.
 Life seemed to have returned to normal. It was unknown when the Chaotic Will would appear.
 In another 700,000 years, the Ultimate Supreme Treasure, the Mystical Destiny Book, would be usable again.
 He hoped that the Chaotic Will would not make him wait too long, lest he wasted the Mystical Destiny Book’s time.
 Han Jue entered cultivation again after reading the emails.
 If he entered seclusion again, he could curse the Carefree Immortal.
 Although he could also associate it with him, he was not that sure.
 On the other side.
 In a domain of the Chaos, in the Heavenly Court.
 Numinous Palace.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor held a jade slip in his hand and used his divine sense to check the information inside. He asked, “Is Divine General Han still in seclusion?”
 An old immortal in the hall nodded. “He has been in seclusion ever since he returned hundreds of thousands of years ago. He has clearly been agitated. Your Majesty, should you visit him to prevent him from going berserk?”
 Han Huang had joined the Heavenly Court for hundreds of thousands of years and had long proved himself. He was now the leader of the Heavenly Generals and his status was second only to the Evil Heavenly Emperor.
 The old immortal hurriedly congratulated him.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor laughed.
 At this moment, the War Buddha suddenly flew in and stopped beside the old immortal. He bowed and said, “Your Majesty, there’s chaos in the Azure Heaven Great World. The Realm Lord can’t stop it. He asked the Heavenly Court for a Great Dao Sage’s assistance.”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor opened his eyes and said, “Someone in the Azure Heaven Great World has attained the Great Dao? There doesn’t seem to be a new Great Dao Sage recently, right?”
 The War Buddha replied, “It’s not a Great Dao Sage, but that being is invincible among Freedom Sages. It needs a Great Dao Sage to take action.”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor said in a low voice, “Pass down my orders. Go invite Divine General Jueshi to quell the chaos.”
 “Yes!”
 The War Buddha immediately left.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor was deep in thought.
 The old immortal asked, “What is Your Majesty worried about?”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor said, “More and more Great Dao Sages and invincible existences rose up among those in the Freedom Realm recently. I keep feeling that something big is about to happen.”
 The old immortal frowned and fell into deep thought.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor looked at the blue sky outside the Numinous Palace and muttered to himself, “What is happening? If the Chaotic New Era you mentioned was not started by him, who was it…”
 A hundred thousand years passed quickly.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and took out the Book of Misfortune.
 Black light burst out and shone on his face, making him look sinister.
 The Dark Forbidden Lord appeared!
 Han Jue touched the Book of Misfortune in fascination and muttered, “It’s your turn again. You must be anxious.”
 The Book of Misfortune trembled slightly as if responding to him.
 Han Jue directly started cursing the Carefree Immortal. He found the target immediately without the Ultimate Dao Treasure’s cover.
  “I feel it!”
 Han Jue’s body trembled and he started cursing with all his might.
 Five days passed quickly.
 His lifespan was deducted!
 Carefree Immortal was a Great Dao Supreme, after all. He definitely could not be cursed to death. Han Jue had to spend his origin lifespan.
 Han Jue opened his attributes panel and stared at the constantly jumping lifespan numbers. He was a little excited.
 It had been a long time since he felt such excitement.
 Nostalgic!
 Han Jue’s eyes turned ruthless. He was not greedy for such excitement. Since he wanted to curse, he had to curse to death!
 Once the Dark Forbidden Lord attacked, the target would either die or be cripled!


 10 billion years of lifespan!
 100 billion years!
 A trillion years!
 10 trillion years!
 Han Jue cursed with all his might and stared at his attributes panel.
 Because the Carefree Immortal did not hate him, he did not know about the other party’s situation.
 In any case, Han Jue decided to give the Carefree Immortal 10 quadrillion years of lifespan.
 It sounded like a lot, but it was only an unobservable small number.
 After all, Carefree Immortal was an undying and eternal existence. He had to spend a lot if he wanted to succeed.
  100 trillion years!
 A quadrillion years!
 10 quadrillion years!
 Han Jue suddenly felt something and suddenly looked up. He discovered that the Seven Supreme Rules above the three thousand Great Dao began to shake violently, like violent dragons and snakes.
 As expected.
 Perhaps the gathering of the Seven Supreme Rules was the Chaotic Will.
 Han Jue stared at the Seven Supreme Rules and continued cursing.
 At this moment…
 Figures appeared under the Seven Supreme Rules. Among them were the Ultimate God of Punishment, the Holy Mother of Order, and Laozi. Han Jue did not recognize the others. From their auras, they were all Great Dao Supremes.
 Soon, the Foolish Sword Sage joined in the fun under the Supreme Rules. “What’s going on?” A mighty figure frowned and asked.
 Laozi said, “There must be karma for the Supreme Rules to react so violently. However, we don’t see anyone wanting to touch the Supreme Rules. In other words, the problem is inside the Supreme Rules.”
 The Holy Mother of Order said, “The Supreme Rules can’t riot for no reason. Something must have happened.”
 Everyone looked at the Ultimate God of Punishment.
 After all, the Ultimate God of Punishment was the Divine Spirits’ leader. He was the Lord of Chaos on the surface and held the highest authority.
 The Ultimate God of Punishment did not say anything but stared at the Supreme Rules.
 A mighty figure suddenly asked, “Why isn’t the Divine Might Heavenly Sage here?”.
 The mighty figures felt that it made sense. This was already the consensus of the Chaos.
 The Ultimate God of Punishment had already experienced the Primordial Heavenly Prison. No matter what he guessed, he definitely had to protect Han Jue. They only heard him say, “It has nothing to do with the Divine Might Heavenly Sage. Back then, the power that the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit borrowed from the Supreme Rule was easily defeated by him. This means that the Supreme Rule is not irresistible to the Divine Might Heavenly Sage. He might even look down on it. There are more than a few Great Dao Supremes in the Chaos.”
 The Holy Mother of Order said, “Previously, the Carefree Immortal captured many geniuses and was killed by the Divine Might Heavenly Sage in the blank domain. Perhaps the Carefree Immortal wants to revive and is absorbing the power of the Supreme Rules.”
 The other mighty figures revealed interested expressions and began to ask about it.
 The Holy Mother of Order told them everything she knew.
 Han Jue was still cursing.
 He had heard the words of the Foolish Sword Sage and the Ultimate God of Punishment, so he did not appear.
 Indeed, there would be a problem if he went out now.
 After all, it would only be his clone even if he went.
 Han Jue’s lifespan was still decreasing.
 1 quintillion years!
 10 quintillion!
 100 quintillion years!
 1 sextillion years!
 10 sextillion years!
 100 sextillion years!
 Han Jue looked up and saw that one of the Supreme Rules had broken.
  His heart trembled.
 Could he have cursed the Supreme Rules to ruin?
 “I want to know if the Supreme Rule will be destroyed if I continue cursing?”
 (i quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [No]
 Han Jue secretly heaved a sigh of relief. The Supreme Rules were still stable.
 Then I won’t hold back!
 Carefree Immortal, you must die!
 His lifespan continued to decrease. The number at the back jumped very quickly, making him inexplicably nervous.
 The breaking of the Supreme Rules made the mighty figures panic. The Ultimate God of Punishment could not maintain his calm.
 The Book of Misfortune had long been upgraded to an Ultimate Dao Treasure. It surpassed the power of the Great Dao Supreme Realm and caused terrifying destruction.
 It had to be known that this was the first time the Supreme Rules had broken since they were created!
 “What should we do?” the Foolish Sword Sage asked. He was very nervous.
 Could another calamity be on the way?
 The other mighty figures began to plan. They used their Dharmic powers to repair the Supreme Rules, but they suffered a backlash.
 “The power of the curse!” the Ultimate God of Punishment was moved and said with a trembling voice.
 The word “curse” made everyone think of a name.
 A mighty figure’s expression darkened. He gritted his teeth and said, “Dark Forbidden Lord! I didn’t expect this fellow to be so strong?”
 “Previously, the Dark Forbidden Lord said that he wanted to deal with it when the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit appeared. So it was not a lie.”
 “But the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit has already died. Why did he touch the Supreme Rules?”
 “Haven’t you heard of anything? When darkness descends, it will be when the Dark Forbidden Lord appears. There’s a high chance that he wants to destroy the Supreme Rules first and make the Chaos lose order, as if it has fallen into darkness.”
 “Fellow Daoist, you are right.”
 “What should we do if it’s really the Dark Forbidden Lord?”
 All the transcendent existences above the Chaotic living beings fell into uneasiness.
 On the other side, Han Jue was still cursing!
 Not long after, he consumed 500 sextillion years of his lifespan!
 A shrill roar suddenly sounded from the broken Supreme Rules.
 “No,”
 The voice’s owner was the Carefree Immortal!
 Most of the mighty figures below the Supreme Rules knew the Carefree Immortal and instantly recognized his voice.
 “It’s indeed the Carefree Immortal! The Dark Forbidden Lord is cursing the Carefree Immortal?” A mighty figure frowned and asked.
 The Holy Mother of Order said, “Impossible. The Carefree Immortal has no karma. No curse can hurt him. We can’t even deduce him. How can the Dark Forbidden Lord curse him?”
  The Foolish Sword Sage frowned. “It’s indeed possible.”
 The scream did not last long before it suddenly stopped.
 Han Jue’s curse missed after that.
 He had consumed 600 sextillion years of his lifespan!
 It had yet to reach its target!
 That’s it?
 When Han Jue’s curse stopped, the broken Supreme Rule began to automatically mend. Seeing this, all the mighty figures heaved a sigh of relief.
 The Holy Mother of Order said, “Looks like it should be the Carefree Immortals doing. He wanted to forcefully revive and absorb the power of the Supreme Rules but suffered a backlash. If it’s the Dark Forbidden Lord, there’s no need for him to deal with the Carefree Immortal. Unless there’s someone from the Dark Forbidden Lord among the geniuses captured by the Carefree Immortal.”
 A mighty figure asked carefully, “Could the Divine Might Heavenly Sage be…” He did not finish his sentence.
 The Holy Mother of Order shook her head. “Probably not. You didn’t witness the battle between the Divine Might Heavenly Sage and the Carefree Immortal. The Carefree Immortal is no threat to the Divine Might Heavenly Sage at all. If he’s really the Dark Forbidden Lord, won’t he be exposing himself? In order to deal with an ant that he can easily crush, exposing his long-hidden identity is too stupid. Besides, the Ultimate God has already said that the Divine Might Heavenly Sage’s karma can be deduced.”
