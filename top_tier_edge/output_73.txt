 Han Jue raised his right hand, and the Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal condensed beside him. Red light burst out and shone in the Grand Primordium Domain, looking ghastly and terrifying
 Laozi’s expression was indifferent as he said, “I just want to ask about the power of the Divine Might Heavenly Sage. You cultivated for ten million years and surpassed us predecessors. Losing to you is also considered a Heavenly Dao inheritance.”
 Han Jue smiled.
 !!
 How shameless!
 In that case, don’t blame him for being impolite!
 Sword Qi rose under Laozi’s feet. Han Jue’s eyes narrowed. He pressed down the Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal and suppressed the sword Qi. He waved his palm and used the Divine Might Great Heaven Palm!
  Laozi turned around and used his finger as a sword.
 Both sides were extremely fast and had already exchanged billions of blows in an instant.
 Sword Qi crisscrossed and the Chaos shattered. It was like a huge spider web that occupied the entire Chaos. The scene was spectacular.
 “As expected of Laozi. He’s quite something.”
 But he’s still not my match!
 Han Jue suddenly stopped. The Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal emitted a terrifying spatial power and moved Laozi into it.
 Laozi did not panic. His body transformed into a sword Qi, but he still couldn’t escape.
 The sword Qi began to shake violently.
 Han Jue suddenly looked up and saw that the void was suddenly torn apart. A huge river poured over, the water filled with sword Qi. Sword Dao River!
 Countless sword Qi swooped down with great momentum and collided with the Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal.
 Han Jue narrowed his eyes. The invisible power of Ultimate Origin surged into the Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal. It quickly expanded, and the entire Sword Dao River became tiny in front of it.
 Sword Dao River couldn’t shatter the Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal no matter how it surged.
 Laozi recovered his body and bathed in the Sword Dao River. He panicked. “What Mystical Power is this… It’s so powerful…”
 Laozi’s heart sank.
 He had guessed that he might lose, but he didn’t expect it to be so thorough. He couldn’t withstand it once Han Jue used his full strength.
 No wonder the twenty thousand Divine Authority Generals were destroyed. No wonder the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit was extremely arrogant and still could not escape death.
 Laozi turned to look at Han Jue and said, “I admit defeat!”
 With that, he vanished into thin air. The vast Sword Dao River above also dissipated.
 This battle fell into the eyes of the distant spectators. They only saw Laozi being suddenly suppressed by Han Jue. Then, Laozi died as soon as the Sword Dao River appeared.
 It was faster than insta-killing!
 Han Jue turned around and flew back into the Grand Primordium Domain.
 The void fell silent.
 Han Jue used his actions to prove his invincibility.
 The title of invincible in the Chaos was not exaggerated!
 In the Ultimate God World.
 All the Great Dao Divine Spirits gathered on a circular platform.
 The Five Great Divine Punishers were also here. Han Tuo’s expression was dark. Yi Tian scratched his ears and cheeks, very irritable.
 The Ultimate God of Punishment’s sudden appearance excited all the Great Dao Divine Spirits.
 “Ultimate God, aren’t we going to attack?”
 “Yes, how powerful am I? I’m the First Disciple of the Dao Ancestor, but I’m like a mortal in front of the Divine Might Heavenly Sage.”
 “Could we be the Divine Might Heavenly Sage’s next target?”
 “No, the Divine Might Heavenly Sage is in the Grand Primordium Domain. He likely wants to revive all the Chaotic Fiendcelestials and reshuffle the Chaotic situation. After all, he’s also a Chaotic Fiendcelestial!”
 The Great Dao Divine Spirits spoke at once. The pressure brought by the Divine Might Heavenly Sage was too strong, causing them to panic and be filled with despair.
 They could no longer find anyone who could resist the Divine Might Heavenly Sage.
 Not even the leader of the Divine Spirits!
 Hundreds of thousands of years ago, the leader of the Divine Spirits had expressed that he would bow down to the Divine Might Heavenly Sage.
 They had encountered an unprecedented situation.
 Be it alone or in a group, the current enemy was not his match!
 If they had to describe it, it would be the three thousand Chaotic Fiendcelestials who faced Pangu back then.
 The Ultimate God of Punishment’s expression was solemn expression as he said, “Even if we join forces, we are not his match unless you are prepared to sacrifice yourselves.”
 The Great Dao Divine Spirits were all silent.
 Han Tuo suddenly took a step forward and said, “I’m willing to sacrifice. The Divine Might Heavenly Sage is my father. Now that he has walked the evil path, as the Divine Punisher, I should put righteousness before family!”
 Yi Tian and the other three stood up and said in unison, “The Five Great Divine Punishers will live and die together!”
 The other Great Dao Divine Spirits were shocked. They didn’t expect their juniors to have such courage.
 The Ultimate God of Punishment said, “Let’s wait a little longer. The Divine Might Heavenly Sage hasn’t slaughtered the Chaos yet. Perhaps there’s still a chance.” He sighed in his heart.
 Fortunately, Master was powerful enough. The entire Chaos couldn’t do anything to him.
 The Holy Mother of Order suddenly said, “Just because we have no choice doesn’t mean that the Chaos has no choice. We can use the power of the Supreme Rules to invite an absolute future mighty figure to kill the Divine Might Heavenly Sage.” Absolute future!
 Yi Tian asked in surprise, “What absolute future mighty figure?”
 “The definition of the future is above time. Time loses its meaning to us after we attain the Great Dao. However, this is not absolute. We have only surpassed the rules of space and time restricted by the three thousand Great Dao. The past and future below the Great Dao are like illusions in our eyes, but the Chaos itself is predestined. The existences who should rise will rise sooner or later. The Supreme Rules surpass the three thousand Great Dao and can invite mighty figures of the future. The mighty figures of the future will definitely be existences that surpass the three thousand Great Dao.”
 The Holy Mother of Order explained, causing the Divine Spirits to be tempted.
 The Holy Mother of Order paused for a moment and said, “A top mighty figure of an era might not be a match for the Divine Might Heavenly Sage if they join forces, but what about ten eras, a hundred eras, or ten thousand eras?”
 The gods widened their eyes in disbelief.
 The Ultimate God of Punishment frowned and asked, “Can the Supreme Rules withstand such great karma? It’s impossible for so many mighty figures to appear directly. It’s equivalent to using the power of the Supreme Rules to manifest.”
 The Ultimate God of Punishment was silent.
 The Great Dao Divine Spirits were excited and expressed their support.
  The Holy Mother of Order said, “In that case, I’ll leave now.”
 She didn’t ask the Ultimate God of Punishment to decide. She turned around and left.
 The Ultimate God of Punishment said, “Disperse.”
 With that, he disappeared. He hid in the dark and immediately sent a dream to Han Jue to tell him about this.
 Han Jue expressed that he knew.
 After the dream ended.
 He opened his eyes and asked in his mind, “The Holy Mother of Order has invited the Chaotic Divine Authority to summon the mighty figures of the various eras. Can my clone win?”
 (1 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 (Yes]


 That’s it?
 You scared me!
 Han Jue cursed silently.
 His heart really trembled when he saw the deduction value.
 !!
 Also, Holy Mother of Order, you’re really a two-faced dog!
 On the surface, you want to be on good terms with me, but you turn around and stab me behind my back?
 Han Jue was furious. He had to find a chance to kill this fellow.
 He stopped thinking and continued cultivating. In any case, his clone was outside.
  During this period of time, Ancestor Tian Xu had already learned Life of All and could surprise the Chaos at any time.
 Han Jue was waiting.
 He was waiting for a chance to face the Chaotic Will
 He wasn’t in a hurry, anyway. It just so happened that fewer and fewer people were finding trouble with him now, and the Heavenly Dao had also returned to peace.
 It didn’t matter even if all living beings hated Han Jue if they couldn’t reach him.
 The billions of disciples in the main Dao Field couldn’t leave. They could only swallow their anger and resume cultivation.
 As for the third Dao Field, it was extremely calm.
 Above the Chaos, below the Seven Supreme Rules.
 The Holy Mother of Order looked up at the Seven Supreme Rules. Great Dao Divine Spirits appeared one after another, including the Five Great Divine Punishers.
 “Hmph, Ultimate God is afraid of the Divine Might Heavenly Sage. The responsibility of protecting the Chaos can only fall upon us!” A Great Dao Divine Spirit snorted. The other Divine Spirits nodded.
 They were already used to it. Previously, the Ultimate God of Punishment had been terrified when facing the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit and the Divine Might Heavenly Sage.
 Back then, the Primordial Ancestor God was so domineering that he couldn’t tolerate a single grain of sand. He wasn’t as cowardly as the Ultimate God of Punishment.
 The Holy Mother of Order ignored them and began to cast a spell. A silver-white water droplet flew out from her palm and quickly expanded, fusing with the Seven Supreme Rules.
 Han Tuo looked at the Holy Mother of Order with a meaningful gaze.
 “This ancient deity is really unfathomable. What role is she playing?”
 Han Tuo was curious. He wasn’t the only one. The other Divine Punishers were also very curious.
 However, the Great Dao Divine Spirits of the older generation were already used to it.
 How could a god who controlled order be an ordinary god? Yi Tian suddenly reminded, “Holy Mother, don’t summon the future Divine Might Heavenly Sage!”
 His words made the Great Dao Divine Spirits nervous.
 One Divine Might Heavenly Sage was enough to make them despair. If a few more came…
 “Don’t worry, I will leave out the Divine Might Heavenly Sage,” the Holy Mother of Order replied calmly.
 The deities began to wait and guard against the Divine Might Heavenly Sage.
 Time quickly passed.
 Three thousand years passed quickly.
 The Holy Mother of Order suddenly retracted her hand. The silver water droplet wrapped in the Seven Supreme Rules exploded. Seven-colored divine light illuminated the void and the three thousand Great Dao changed color.
 All the gods looked over. The seven Supreme Rules had already fused into a seven-colored rule. It was like a dragon twisting its body. The vast aura it emitted humbled the gods.
 “The Holy Mother of Order requests the Chaotic Divine Authority to activate the absolute future and save this world!”
 The Holy Mother of Order’s voice sounded, divine and dignified.
 The Chaotic Divine Authority began to shake violently, and the seven-colored divine light became even stronger.
 All the gods waited nervously.
 This was the Chaos’ only hope!
 The memories in his mind made him hate his father, but he felt pain when he thought of how he was his biological father.
 Yi Tian patted his shoulder and grinned at him, as if to say, “Brother, you still have me.”
 The pressure in Han Tuo’s heart decreased.
 The seven-colored divine light began to gather into a huge heavenly net, reflecting countless images. They were dense and changed extremely quickly. Even the Great Dao Divine Spirits were dazzled.
 After a long while…
 Figures began to condense in the seven-colored divine light net. All of them emitted a monstrous aura and were extremely powerful.
 The first batch of figures were all Great Dao Sages. There were seven Great Dao Supremes, for a total of 170 figures!
 Figures began to condense again just as they stepped out of the Heavenly Net.
 The second batch of figures was also the weakest Great Dao Sage. They included 18 Great Dao Supremes, for a total of 199 figures!
 The Great Dao Divine Spirits were overjoyed upon sensing the terrifying aura ahead.
 The Chaos was saved!
 The Holy Mother of Order began to receive the first two batches of mighty figures from the future. At the same time, the third batch of mighty figures was still condensing.
 Far away in the Grand Primordium Domain.
 Han Jue’s clone also felt it.
 He raised his eyebrows and muttered, “This method is indeed impressive.”
 He couldn’t sense what this future power was about.
 Han Jue closed his eyes and continued waiting
 He would attack after the Holy Mother of Order finished the summoning and was full of confidence.
 He wanted to bring true despair to the Chaos!
 No matter how many supreme experts you summon from the past, present, and future, they will wail in front of me, the Divine Might Heavenly Sage!
 Han Jue had always pursued invincibility to make the number of enemies meaningless!
 True invincibility was not something that could be suppressed by numbers!
 The three thousand Great Dao trembled slightly. The aura that gathered above was too strong.
 The actions of the Great Dao Divine Spirits also attracted the hidden Great Dao Sages in the Chaos. More and more Great Dao Sages rushed over. They were shocked to discover their future disciples and descendants, and there was more than one.
 For example, Di Jiang encountered five Di Jiangs from different eras in the future.
 There were already more than ten thousand Great Dao Sages under the Chaotic Divine Authority, and the number was still increasing!
 Han Tuo saw his future self, but he did not go forward to greet him. Instead, Yi Tian was very passionate.
 Han Huang and Jiang Jueshi also came and also saw their future selves, making them quite surprised.
 “Divine Might Heavenly Sage? No wonder you summoned us.”
 “It’s said that at the beginning of the endless time, a Divine Might Heavenly Sage once suppressed the Chaos and disappeared for some reason. So he was destroyed by us.”
 “Hahaha, the Divine Might Heavenly Sage deserves to die since he dares to harm the Chaos!”
 “Today’s battle will definitely enter the annals of the Chaos!”
 “Future me, what realm are you at?”
 “I’m ashamed. My cultivation level has only increased by a minor realm in the past ten trillion years. I’m currently at the late-stage Great Dao Primordial Chaos Realm.”
 The void under the Chaotic Divine Authority became more and more lively.
 After all, they were dealing with their own father.
 At this moment, a handsome man in a red dragon white robe flew in front of them. He cupped his fists and said, “I, Han Yao, am here to apologize to the two ancestors.”
 Han Huang sized him up and suddenly frowned.
 Han Yao said seriously, “I won’t help you!”
 “Sorry, but I, Han Yao, will never let anyone hurt the progenitor, not even you, the two ancestors!”
 With that, Han Yao turned around and left.
 Han Tuo and Han Huang were stunned.
 The surrounding Great Dao Divine Spirits were moved. Why did they summon a traitor?


 A Great Dao Divine Spirit came in front of the Holy Mother of Order and sent a voice transmission, “Holy Mother, be careful. A traitor has appeared. Don’t summon too many.”
 The Holy Mother of Order did not answer. She chatted with the mighty figures from the future. The Great Dao Divine Spirits couldn’t say much, afraid that it would affect morale.
 Yi Tian approached Han Tuo and sighed, “Looks like the Divine Might Heavenly Sage is still influential to his descendants. Does this mean that it’s very difficult to kill him this time?”
 Han Tuo’s expression darkened.
 !!
 It was unknown what Han Huang was thinking.
 Jiang Jueshi said, “Not necessarily. Perhaps he died. If the descendants want to hide this past, they will naturally beautify Master.”
 Yi Tian felt that it made sense.
 At the same time, figures were still emerging from the Chaotic Divine Authority. The weakest was a Great Dao Sage.
 The new future experts sensed the solemn atmosphere and did not dare to ask. They could only ask their past selves.
 Soon, the number of Great Dao Sages here exceeded twenty thousand and was still increasing
 Thirty thousand!
 Forty thousand!
 Fifty thousand!
 The Great Dao Sages present were no longer excited. They only felt nervous inside.
 How strong was an enemy that even fifty thousand Great Dao Sages could not defeat?
 There would definitely be heavy casualties!
 No one dared to disturb the Holy Mother of Order. They believed that she knew what to do.
 The Holy Mother of Order did not stop, which meant that it was not enough.
 Time passed.
 Jiang Jueshi turned to look at the future Jiang Jueshi and discovered that his future self was a little different, but he couldn’t tell what was different.
 Han Huang stared at the future Jiang Jueshi with an extremely cold gaze.
 The future Jiang Jueshi smiled at him.
 Yi Tian suddenly asked, “Why are you the only one in your future?”
 Han Huang had three futures selves, and Han Tuo had more than ten.
 Jiang Jueshi was stunned and did not know what to say.
 The future Jiang Jueshi smiled and said, “He has many future selves, but they are all isolated by me.”
 Isolated?
 Han Tuo, Han Huang, Yi Tian, and the other Divine Punishers standing nearby were all stunned.
 What kind of method was this?
 The future Jiang Jueshi smiled and said, “Alright, let’s wait and see. There will be a good show next.”
 Yi Tian stared at him and asked in a low voice, “Are you also a traitor?”
 The future Jiang Jueshi shook his head and laughed.
 Jiang Jueshi frowned and fell into deep thought.
 In the Grand Primordium Domain.
 Han Jue’s clone was still waiting.
 “The Holy Mother of Order is really patient,” Han Jue muttered to himself. There were already more than a hundred thousand Great Dao Sages. There were already thousands of Great Dao Supremes among them. The Holy Mother of Order was still summoning.
 Sigh!
 Something was wrong.
 If it was a novel that Han Jue had read in his previous life, the enemy would only face destruction if they underestimated the protagonist. Counting Han Jue’s past enemies, every one of them had a backup plan and never underestimated him. It was just that they didn’t overestimate him enough.
 The reason why they didn’t overestimate him was that he kept a low profile.
  Han Jue wasn’t in a hurry.
 In the third Dao Field.
 Han Jue began the simulation trial. The target was the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit. He had secretly copied the data when he fought the other party previously.
 Several days later.
 Han Jue was very confident.
 I’ll look down on you if you summon less than a million!
 Ten years later.
 The Chaotic Divine Authority finally left. The Holy Mother of Order turned to look at the countless mighty figures around her. Their auras became vast as they gathered together.
 The Holy Mother of Order said, “Everyone, we are about to face an unprecedented enemy. He is too powerful and can be considered the number one since ancient times. However, I don’t know if he will be counted in the future. I don’t want anything to happen to you, so gather enough forces and suppress him forcefully!
 “No, it’s enough to suppress any powerful enemy!”
 Her words were very soft, but the hearts of more than a million Great Dao Sages surged with blood.
 Looking up, such a grand occasion would almost never happen again!
 “Great Dao Divine Spirit, lead the way to the Grand Primordium Domain. Kill the Divine Might Heavenly Sage and eliminate evil for the Chaos in the future!”
 The Holy Mother of Order waved her hand. With that said, the million Great Dao Sages erupted with a terrifying aura. Led by the current Great Dao Divine Spirit, they flew towards the Grand Primordium Domain.
 “Divine Might Heavenly Sage, I didn’t expect to really face this legend today.”
 “There are also legends of the Divine Might Heavenly Sage in my era. It’s said he’s invincible.”
 “It’s fine. With so many mighty figures joining forces, not to mention one Divine Might Heavenly Sage, even a hundred will die!”
 “Hahaha, this battle will definitely rewrite history!”
 “Perhaps this is history, but we just didn’t know.”
 How terrifying was the aura of a million Great Dao Sages? It shocked the entire Chaos.
 More and more cultivators rushed to the Grand Primordium Domain. Their cultivation levels were at least that of a Freedom Sage. No matter how low their cultivation levels were, they did not dare to go. Even if they hated the Divine Might Heavenly Sage, they would not blindly die.
 How fast were they? With the help of so many Great Dao Supremes, they arrived in front of the Grand Primordium Domain in less than five minutes and surrounded it.
 Han Jue slowly stood up. Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols appeared above his head. All of them were majestic and gathered together. Even the Grand Primordium Domain couldn’t contain them.
 Han Jue looked up and saw many familiar faces.
 His two sons were here, as well as his disciple.
 They were probably being beaten somewhere.
 To trap a Great Dao Sage and beat him, it had to be a dangerous place.
 Han Jue was just thinking casually. His attention was still on the scene in front of him.
 “Divine Might Heavenly Sage, surrender!” a Great Dao Divine Spirit shouted angrily. The killing intent of a million Great Dao Sages erupted and locked onto Han Jue.
 The void instantly shattered like a mirror, leaving only the Primordial Void.
 The Grand Primordium Domain also shattered!
  A peerless battle was about to break out!
 Han Jue looked at the million Great Dao Sages and thought to himself, “I wanted you to summon a million, but you really did it!”
 It had to be said that the Holy Mother of Order was still very capable.
 Unfortunately, it was not enough! “There’s no point in saying anything. Come and die!” Han Jue said domineeringly. The three thousand Chaotic Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols were successfully condensed. They stood behind Han Jue with their backs facing each other and roared in all directions, shaking the entire Primordial Void.
 “Kill!”
 A Great Dao Supreme in golden armor was the first to attack. He held a halberd that emitted a divine light and attacked Han Jue. The moment he moved, tens of thousands of mighty figures immediately followed.
 Hundreds of thousands of Great Dao Sages used their Mystical Powers together. They first sealed this void to prevent Han Jue from escaping
 All sorts of domineering and exquisite Mystical Powers attacked Han Jue. In an instant, he saw countless illusions, as if ten thousand reincarnations had passed.
 Petty trick!
 Han Jue’s red eyes lit up and directly dispersed countless illusion Mystical Powers.


 The three thousand Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols suddenly rushed in all directions. They were extremely domineering and sent countless Great Dao Sages flying. The power of the three thousand Great Dao was even used together, whistling through the battlefield.
 Thunder rumbled in the sky and the Dao River flowed. The huge tree rose from the sky. Countless branches divided the battlefield. The stars evolved and transformed into meteors that smashed into the Great Dao Sages in every corner of the battlefield. A manifestation of the Great Dao even formed. The concept was magnificent and reflected the past.
 Han Jue kept flashing, and the Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal hit the Great Dao Sages one after another.
 They were all insta-killed!
 Han Jue didn’t hold back at all. He used his full strength!
 No one could withstand a single blow from him!
 More than five hundred Great Dao Sages had died in less than three breaths of time. Their bodies and souls were destroyed.
 They could revive if they still had a backup plan. If not, they would disappear into thin air.
 The dominance of the Divine Might Heavenly Sage greatly affected the morale of the Chaos!
  The battle had just begun!
 The three thousand Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols restrained most of the Chaotic experts. Han Jue’s main body killed crazily. The Great Dao Sages outside panicked.
 “How is this possible! How can he be so powerful?”
 “Aren’t Great Dao Sages undying and indestructible?”
 “They’re indeed considered undying and indestructible in the Chaos, but that Divine Might Heavenly Sage has already surpassed the Chaos!”
 “No wonder we need the help of so many future mighty figures!”
 “Go, use your ability and risk it. We will have no future to speak of if we lose this battle!”
 Han Jue didn’t care about their feelings. His killing intent had already risen and he definitely couldn’t hold it back!
 He kept using the power of space to move around. The Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal smashed into the enemies one after another. Every enemy was smashed by the Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal and turned into dust on the spot. It was domineering and terrifying.
 Han Jue moved again, but this time, his movements paused slightly.
 Because his opponent was Divine Lord Peacock!
 “This fellow…”
 Han Jue’s eyes flickered. The Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal landed and destroyed Divine Lord Peacock’s body, deliberately giving him a chance to escape.
 Divine Lord Peacock did not disappoint him and quickly fled.
 “Divine Might Heavenly Sage, just you wait!” Divine Lord Peacock’s indignant shout sounded. Han Jue was indifferent.
 If not for the fact that he had allies among the enemy, he would have long used his Dharma Idol Fusion Technique to slaughter all the enemies in the void.
 Han Jue continued fighting.
 He suddenly discovered a strange figure. Outside the Chaotic Army, a man in a red dragon white robe was charging in. His attacks were extremely ruthless. He had already killed several Great Dao Sages and was quickly surrounded.
 Han Jue glanced over as he fought.
 He felt the closeness of his bloodline.
 Could this person be his descendant from the future?
 Very likely! Far away in the third Dao Field, Han Jue’s main body began to deduce.
 He discovered that this person was a descendant of him and Li Yao, but not within three generations.
 Han Jue was a little relieved. He didn’t expect that someone among his future descendants would dare to risk their lives to save him.
 “What’s your name?”
 Han Jue sent a voice transmission to Han Yao.
 “I won’t reveal my name for the time being to prevent causing unwanted karma,” Han Yao replied.
 Han Jue could only deduce their bloodline relationship and couldn’t deduce his exact experience and name.
 “Interesting.”
  Han Jue smiled and didn’t ask further.
 His strength terrified more and more Great Dao Sages, but Han Yao’s sudden rise became an outlet for their fear.
 More and more Great Dao Sages went to fight him. Facing the siege of dozens of Great Dao Sages, Han Yao was still very relaxed. He kept using the Divine Might Great Heaven Palm and relied on this Mystical Power to stand invincible.
 However, good times did not last!
 An even stronger Divine Might Great Heaven Palm attacked, forcing him back.
 Han Yao looked over and saw Han Huang attacking with a purple dragon condensed from Primordial Qi. His face was filled with killing intent, like the Chaotic Devil Master, insufferably arrogant.
 “Ancestor Han Huang…”
 Han Yao’s expression became unprecedentedly serious. He raised his sleeves and a terrifying aura erupted. A purple Dharma idol emerged from his body. It had three heads and ten arms. Its long hair fluttered and its exact face could not be seen.
 Han Huang said, “I didn’t expect to meet my own kind!”
 Jiang Jueshi and the five Divine Punishers attacked. Hearing Han Huang’s words, they were secretly surprised.
 What kind?
 Han Yao shook his head. “You’re flattering me. I’m still far from it, but I’ve wanted to challenge you for a long time!”
 He suddenly rushed towards Han Huang, who was naturally not afraid. The two of them fought. The Divine Might Great Heaven Palm became an ordinary move. As Han Yao attacked crazily, his purple Dharma idol was the same. All sorts of Mystical Powers were at his fingertips. No Great Dao Sage within a radius of a quadrillion kilometers dared to approach them.
 Han Huang held the Primordial Power in both hands like two purple spears. As he waved it, his Dharmic powers were like dragons that wreaked havoc.
 On the other side.
 Han Jue had already slaughtered more than ten thousand Great Dao Sages. The number of casualties was still increasing.
 “Impudent!”
 A shout sounded. Han Jue felt a rather powerful attack. It was invisible and charged at his soul.
 Han Jue’s Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal suddenly appeared behind him. With a flash of red light, a figure was trapped. It was an old Daoist with a terrified expression.
 “How is that possible! My Mystical Power…” the old Daoist roared angrily. However, he was crushed by the Ultimate Origin Power before he could finish speaking.
 His Mystical Power was similar to Great Sage Void Soul’s Dark Origin. It was indeed impressive and could easily kill enemies at the same realm.
 Unfortunately, he was facing Han Jue.
 He suddenly rose. Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols flew over from all directions and quickly shrank. They entered his body, causing his aura to begin to increase.
 A terrifying pressure enveloped the entire Primordial Void. Even Han Huang and Han Yao, who were still fighting, stopped in shock and looked at him in disbelief.
 They knew that Han Jue was very strong, but his aura…
 After fusing with the three thousand Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols, Han Jue’s aura reached the extreme. He wantonly displayed his strength, causing the entire Chaos to tremble.
 The three thousand Great Dao trembled violently. The light and darkness of the Chaotic Divine Authority changed. The space at the edge of the Chaos twisted violently like a mirror, threatening to shatter at any time.
  Countless worlds, small worlds, hidden domains, and deep spaces felt Han Jue’s terrifying pressure.
 Including all living beings in the Heavenly Dao!
 All the living beings in the Chaos felt like the sky was collapsing!
 More than 900,000 Great Dao Sages looked up at the high and mighty Han Jue, all in shock.
 This aura…
 Impossible!
 “How can there be such a powerful…” a Great Dao Supreme said with a trembling voice. A Great Dao Supreme was top-notch in any era, but he felt like a mortal facing Han Jue’s aura.
 This shock was the most impactful to the Great Dao Supremes!
 Because they had always thought that they were standing at the peak of cultivation. At most, there was a difference in Dharmic powers!


 Han Jue saw that all the enemies below had fallen into fear and despair. He was satisfied.
 Such a battle was worth it after cultivating diligently for ten million years!
 In any case, he was already prepared to fall out with the Ninth Chaos. He naturally had to show off and have a good time!
 Han Jue raised his right hand, and the Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal condensed in front of him. The Ultimate Origin Power after fusing the three thousand Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols poured into the Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal, causing it to instantly double in size.
 It was as if a tiny piece of paper had suddenly transformed into the sky and covered more than 900,000 Great Dao Sages.
 Han Juels gaze landed on the Holy Mother of Order. He smiled. “After you lose, do you still have any methods left?”
 The Holy Mother of Order was silent.
 Han Jue glanced over. It was the Evil Heavenly Emperor.
  The Evil Heavenly Emperor stared at him and said, “Stop here. There’s still a way back. Han Jue, the Chaos is not as simple as you think. There are transcendent existences outside the Chaos. Although I can’t understand why you did those things, on account of our past relationship, I have to advise you not to insist.”
 Han Jue was touched.
 Even though his memories had been tampered with by the Chaotic Will, the Evil Heavenly Emperor still remembered their past relationship.
 Han Jue smiled. “Thank you for your kind intentions, Your Majesty. The will of the Chaos is forcing me so much, so I naturally won’t let it go. I, Han Jue, have lived for ten million years and am almost always cultivating in seclusion. At most, I have traveled in the Heavenly Dao for a few hundred years. I have a clear conscience regarding the Chaos. I have never harmed the Chaos and have even helped it. Regardless of fate or destiny, I only do what I want to do.
 “No one can determine my fate. The Chaotic Will can’t. Even if there really are transcendent existences above the Chaos, they can’t!”
 Han Jue narrowed his eyes, and the Evil Heavenly Emperor was moved out of the void.
 The Holy Mother of Order shouted, “Hurry up and attack!”
 More than 900,000 Great Dao Sages used their strongest Mystical Powers together. A strong light rose and shone on Han Jue.
 Han Jue pressed down with his right hand. His expression was cold as he shouted in a low voice, “If you want to blame someone, blame the so-called Chaotic Will!”
 The endless and terrifying Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal descended with the power to destroy the world!
 The two extremely powerful forces collided!
 Looking down from above the Chaos, white light burst out from the vast Chaos. It quickly expanded and transformed into a visible impact that swept through the Chaos, causing the painting of the Chaos to ripple.
 However, the white light quickly disappeared.
 Primordial Void.
 The remnant aura floated like a cloud. It was not harmful or bloody. Only the vast pressure did not dissipate for a long time.
 Han Jue stood in the remnant aura and his gaze landed on a figure below.
 Jiang Jueshi!
 To be precise, it was the future Jiang Jueshi.
 Han Jue was expressionless but surprised.
 Could it be Jiang Jueshi, the Dao Creator?
 Even if Han Jue knew, he had to pretend not to.
 The future Jiang Jueshi sighed. “Master, you’re really ruthless. You killed them all?”
 Han Jue said, “I left your fellow disciples alive.”
 Everyone he cared about was locked in the Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal. He would release them when he had the chance.
 Apart from that, the million Great Dao Sages were all destroyed. Even the Holy Mother of Order died. The future Jiang Jueshi said, “Master, what do you plan to do next? Slaughter all living beings and make the Chaos focus on you?”
 “All living beings can’t do anything to me. Why should I kill them? In the end, they are only pitiful worms controlled by the Chaotic Will. I only eliminated existences who found trouble with me. If time can erase this forced hatred, I’m willing to write off this hatred and not interfere with them.”
 Han Jue meant it.
  The future Jiang Jueshi said, “Master has indeed not changed. I really want to help you, but for now, I don’t exist. Those existences above the Chaos don’t know of my appearance. I’m only using my will to enter this era.
 “Master, I only want to say one thing to you. No matter what, you have to survive. I can’t save you, but please save yourself.”
 With that, the future Jiang Jueshi dissipated as if he was never there.
 Han Jue showed a frown.
 He knew that the future Jiang Jueshi was the Dao Creator he had deduced previously. In that future, he had died in this calamity.
 However, Jiang Jueshi’s words surprised him.
 Previously, Han Jue thought that the future was fake. It was impossible for him to die.
 Now that the future Jiang Jueshi had appeared, didn’t that mean that the future really existed?
 Was the Dao Creator Jiang Jueshi here to persuade him to bow his head?
 Han Jue looked at the vast Primordial Void in a daze.
 At this moment, he felt a powerful suction force.
 Han Jue swayed and opened his eyes again. He discovered that he had arrived in front of the Chaotic Divine Authority.
 The Chaotic Divine Authority fused with the Seven Supreme Rules was so holy.
 Han Jue was already prepared to face the Chaotic Will.
 Indeed!
 The Chaotic Divine Authority began to change and gradually condensed into a figure. One could only see its figure and not its true appearance.
 “Han Jue, you destroyed the Great Dao Sages of the past, present, and future. Now, other than your disciples, there are no Great Dao Sages in the Chaos. Are you still unwilling to give up?”
 The voice of the Chaotic Will sounded. Its tone was indifferent, like the Holy Mother of Order without any emotions.
 Han Jue snorted. “Shouldn’t it be you who’s supposed to stop? Chaotic Will!
 “I’m very curious about who you are and what you’re plotting!”
 The Chaotic Will was a rule, after all. Han Jue felt that the Chaotic Will might be a pretense and there was someone else behind it.
 It was either the Ninth Chaos or an ancient god who controlled all living beings with the will of the Chaos.
 Han Jue felt that it should be the latter.
 If it was the Ninth Chaos, there was really no need to cause so much trouble.
 If an outsider invaded the Primordial World and threatened it, Han Jue would directly crush him to death. He wouldn’t have gone through so much trouble.
 The Chaotic Will was silent.
  Han Jue said, “Do you still remember Ancestor Tian Xu? He’s not dead. He’s already been refined into a puppet by me. I’ll teach him the Dao Destruction Mystical Power. If the Chaotic Will still doesn’t give up, I’ll drag all living beings down with me. Since we can’t live anyway, we’ll die together!”
 “Impudent!”
 The Chaotic Will shouted, “Han Jue, you are a Great Dao Supreme, after all. How dare you say such childish words?”
 Han Jue said with killing intent, “Recover the memories of all living beings. Otherwise, everything will start from the beginning
 again!”
 The Chaotic Will fell silent.

 Nine-Headed Divine Spirit?
 Han Jue’s main body immediately checked the Nine-Headed Divine Spirit’s portrait. It was black and as mysterious as the Dao Ancestor.
 [Nine-Headed Divine Spirit: Chaotic cultivation, Chaotic Will, Ancient Great Dao Divine Spirit, Son of the Ninth Chaos. Because you threatened him with the Chaos, he has developed hatred towards you. Current Hatred Points: 6 stars]
