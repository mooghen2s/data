 Ji Xianshen, Fang Liang, and Heavenly Venerate Xun meditated side by side.
 In front of them was a blood-red figure. It was Chu Xiaoqi. His body was surrounded by blood Qi and he was in a violent state. He was trembling and his expression was sinister, like a human-shaped ferocious beast that had lost its mind.
 Fang Liang said worriedly, “It doesn’t feel right. Are we being played?”
 !!
 Heavenly Venerate Xun asked, “Why aren’t you looking for the Lord?”
 Ji Xianshen opened his eyes and glanced at him. “Is the Lord so easy to find?”
 Heavenly Venerate Xun was silent.
 He had worshiped Han Jue since he was young, but he had never seen him with his own eyes. Even so, Han Jue still had a significant status in his heart.
 There was a consensus in the entire Endless
 Era, and that was that the Dao Creator could not inherit it. It required great opportunities and a long time. Otherwise, since ancient times, there would not be so many Dao Creators.
 Han Huang and Han Ling were both top-notch existences in the Chaos. Even so, they were still working hard for the Dao Creator.
 Fang Liang said, “Alright, cultivate. We can’t go to the blank domain for some time. This is a good opportunity to consolidate our
 cultivation. Heavenly Venerate Xun, hurry up and open up your Great Dao World.”
 Heavenly Venerate Xun nodded and closed his eyes to continue cultivating.
 Chu Xiaoqi suddenly quietened down, his eyes slightly stunned.
 At this moment, in the depths of his soul.
 Chu Xiaoqi slowly woke up. He opened his eyes
 and saw darkness.
 He looked around and suddenly saw a figure.
 Grandpa!
 Han Jue looked at him with a smile.
 He hurriedly rushed over and asked excitedly, “Grandpa, why are you here? What is this
 place?”
 Han Jue waved his hand and let him see the situation outside his body.
 Everything that had happened during this
 period of time turned into memories and surged into his mind, causing him to be
 stunned.
 Soon, Chu Xiaoqi trembled. He did feel fear,
 anger.
 Someone was actually using him to do these
 things. At the same time, he knew his true
 identity.
 Primordial Despair…
 He had heard that it was a terrifying demon
 but
 who had once wreaked havoc in the Great Dao
 However, he never expected that he was not
 the hero in the story, not the savior, but an ugly and evil villain.
 Chu Xiaoqi discovered that his will couldn’t
 Han Jue smiled and said, “Let’s continue watching.”
 Chu Xiaoqi immediately calmed down.
 Han Jue sat down and gestured for him to sit in
 front of him. He began to preach the Dao.
 As Chu Xiaoqi listened, he forgot about the danger he was in.
 More than sixty million years passed like this.
 Chu Xiaoqi suddenly saw Ji Xianshen and the
 other two stand up and bring him to the blank domain again to go on another slaughter. Exasperated, he looked at Han Jue and asked, “Grandpa, why aren’t you saving me?” Han Jue said, “Don’t be anxious. They’re also
 being used. The true mastermind has yet to
 appear.”
 ||
 There was a mastermind?
 Chu Xiaoqi could not imagine. Ji Xianshen and
 the other two were so strong. Who could use
 them?
 Could it be a Dao Creator?
 Thinking of this, he couldn’t help but ask,
 “Grandpa, can you deal with him if the other party is a Dao Creator?”
 Legend had it that the Dao Creator Realm was
 the highest. A Dao Creator was invincible. The Lord only had a higher status than the Dao Creator. If they really fought, he would not be
 able to kill the Dao Creator. If that were the
 case, there would not be any enmity between the Dao Creators.
 Han Jue smiled and asked, “Do you look down on your grandpa so much?”
 Chu Xiaoqi was stunned, his eyes filled with anticipation.
 He was looking forward to the battle between
 Dao Creators!
 Ji Xianshen and the other two brought Chu
 Xiaoqi to wreak havoc again. However, less than twenty breaths after they appeared, three terrifying figures descended. They were the three Primordial Fiendcelestials!
 “Master!”
 Han Huang and the other two attacked without another word.
 Chaos fused. Their cultivation levels were identical. The difference in strength was only reflected in their potential and Mystical Powers.
 They transformed into Primordial Fiendcelestials. Their postures were indeed worthy of being Fiendcelestials.
 Chu Xiaoqi exclaimed in admiration.
 Soon, his body was suppressed. Han Huang attacked Ji Xianshen and the other two. At first, Han Huang could not touch them, but
 he was the number one person below the Dao Creator Realm, after all. He quickly found a flaw and pulled them out of the Origin Space-time.
 In terms of true strength, Ji Xianshen and the
 other two were not Han Huang’s match. They quickly lost. At the critical moment, a mysterious force descended and swept them
 away.
 “He’s here,” Han Jue said softly and smiled.
ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels Chu Xiaoqi asked in confusion, “Is it the mastermind?”
 Han Jue didn’t say anything. He just smiled.
 Ji Xianshen and the other two returned to the Origin Space-time. The Origin Space-time here was only an independent plane. It was equivalent to a branch of the Origin Space-time, and it was used especially as a place to hide.
 At this moment, a mysterious aura appeared in
 the depths of Chu Xiaoqi’s soul. A black shadow
 appeared beside him and then immediately disappeared. “You want to leave? Too late!” Han Jue sneered. The surrounding darkness
 shattered. His and Chu Xiaoqi’s consciousness
 arrived in another void. In front of them was a dark red color, and an incredibly majestic figure was hidden inside. Even Chu Xiaoqi, a Great Dao Supreme, was shocked. “You…”
 A voice sounded, filled with anger. Han Jue smiled and said, “Isn’t it strange? He
 clearly saw that you were the only one in your consciousness, but he discovered that I was there as soon as he entered?”
 Chu Xiaoqi was extremely nervous and did not
 dare to speak.
 “Hmph, is this the power of the Lord? I indeed
 didn’t expect it. Although the Lord is strong, he’s at least not worlds apart from a Dao Creator. I’ve been careful for so long, but I didn’t expect to still be caught.” That mighty figure was the Ninth Chaos’ mental demon. His body had transformed from the Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil.


 “How should I address the current you?” Han Jue asked. His tone was casual and his aura was not strong, but Chu Xiaoqi felt the power of a Lord.
 He controlled everything and looked down on everything!
 Chu Xiaoqi’s heart burned with flames.
 This was his goal!
 !!
 “You can still call me the Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil. I’m willing to use my demonic name and reopen everything. Since I’ve already been discovered, let’s fight.”
 The Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil’s voice sounded. The huge figure hidden in the dark red light began to shrink until it was a billion feet tall.
 His aura suddenly erupted. In an instant, Chu Xiaoqi actually felt as if he was about to be reduced to ashes. Fortunately, Han Jue isolated the other party’s aura in time.
 The Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil walked towards him. He spread his arms and two terrifying ferocious beasts that looked like dragons and pythons coiled around them. The shadows of two divine weapons appeared in his hands, looking like a spear and an axe.
 Han Jue clearly felt that the power of rules formed the two divine weapons, and they were not ordinary.
 The basic rules of the blank domain!
 Unfortunately, he had only borrowed the power of rules and had not grasped it deeply enough. If he could really easily mobilize the basic power of rules, he would be a Creator Lord! The Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil suddenly disappeared and appeared above Han Jue’s head. Before the two Rule Divine Soldiers landed, a huge barrier appeared around Han Jue and blocked the invisible power of rules. Boom-
 Chu Xiaoqi saw everything outside the barrier collapse and shatter. An indescribable soul pain caused him to squat down like a mortal.
 “How is this possible… I’m a perfected Great Dao Supreme…’
 Chu Xiaoqi’s eyes widened in disbelief.
 He knew that a Dao Creator was very strong,
 but he was actually so powerful. His flames of ambition were directly extinguished.
 Was he lying…
 Could cultivation really reach this level?
 The Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil raised the Rule
 Divine Soldier and slashed down angrily. Endless power surged from all directions and
 drowned the barrier Han Jue created.
 Space-time, time, karma, creation, destruction,
 fate, negative karma, and so on!
 Thousands of rules attacked without
 any
 blind
 spots, so vast was their power!
 The basic Rule Space layer above also began to
 be torn apart. A huge hole was suddenly torn in a corner of the blank domain. The power of basic rules gathered together and spat out like a dark pillar of light, splitting the blank domain into two. This scene attracted the Dao Creators’
 attention.
 The Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil’s power had actually broken through the basic rules!
 The Ninth Chaos, the Formless Transcendent Deity, the Chaotic Consciousness, Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction Venerable, and the Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity appeared in front of the dark pillar of light, not daring to
 approach.
 “What a powerful force…” Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction Venerable said with
 a trembling voice. He felt that even as a Dao
 Creator, he would be torn apart once he
 approached!
 At this moment, Han Huang, the Dao Ancestor,
 Han Ling, and the other top Great Dao experts of the blank domain arrived. The Ninth Chaos waved his hand and sent them back while
 isolating this space.
 In the deep space.
 The Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil looked down, his cold eyes filled with fascination.
 “Is this the true power of existence… It’s too
 strong. Even a Dao Creator can’t resist. Perhaps I’ve already surpassed the Dao Creator Realm, but I just didn’t know. The higher realm is not
 as obvious as before.”
 The Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil thought
 silently. He was borrowing the basic rule power. His gaze couldn’t pass through the vast
 rule power. He didn’t know if Han Jue and Chu Xiaoqi were alive, but facing such power, he felt that even if Han Jue didn’t die, he was still stubbornly resisting.
 He suddenly saw the sea of rules below being
 pierced by red lights. It was instantly riddled
 with holes, startling him.
 Boom-
 The vast basic rule power suddenly dissipated
 and transformed into countless stars that
 spiraled down like a hurricane. The Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal appeared below and absorbed all the stars formed by the basic rule
 power.
 Under the Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal were Han Jue and Chu Xiaoqi.
 Chu Xiaoqi sat paralyzed and watched all of this with his mouth agape.
 What Mystical Power was this…
 This was too shocking!
 Even he, a Great Dao Supreme, could not use
 his eyes to determine how big the Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal was.
 The entire Dao Mystic Realm was perhaps a drop in the ocean in front of the Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal. One had to know that the Dao Mystic Realm contained myriad worlds. There were more than ten thousand worlds,
 and every world was a universe that contained
 billions of small worlds.
 “You…”
 knowing what to say.
 Han Jue looked up and smiled. “Your strength is alright. Unfortunately, you’re still begging it and not controlling it. Next, feel its true
 power!”
 Boom!
 The endless Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal rushed up. The Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil immediately moved in fear.
 However, no matter how he moved, the Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal was still
 approaching him.
 He couldn’t shake it off!
 “No, the space is condensed by him. I can’t escape!” The surrounding space kept changing. Although he felt that he was indeed jumping
 spaces, he was still in the Ultimate Origin
 Heaven Seal area.
 This seal actually contained the power
 of
 space
 and time! The Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil had no choice
 but to use all his strength to attack the Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal. He erupted with
 all his strength, but it collapsed when it collided with the Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal. The difference in talent was too great! The Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil was stunned.
 “What realm is he at… How far am I from the realm above the Dao Creator…” The Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil was confused,
 just like when his main body, the Ninth Chaos, faced Han Jue. The Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal did not let him go. It quickly rose and absorbed him. Chu Xiaoqi looked up at the vast Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal and could no longer see the Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil’s figure. He didn’t know what happened above because his naked
 eyes and divine sense could not pass through
 it.
 However, he understood one thing. Any existence was tiny in front of such power!
 From his point of view, it was as if the sky was rising with unstoppable force. Heavenly ascension!
 “I’ve finally dealt with him. I can be free in the
 future.” Han Jue’s laughter floated into his ears. Chu Xiaoqi came back to his senses and asked
 carefully, “Grandpa, were his body and soul destroyed?”
 Han Jue smiled and said, “A Dao Creator can’t
 be killed. However, I will imprison him until I
 can kill him.”
 Chu Xiaoqi looked at him in admiration and was extremely excited. “Grandpa… you’re too strong! “Grandpa, what Mystical Power is this!
 “Oh my god, is this the power of a Lord?” Chu Xiaoqi chattered non-stop as if he had returned to his childhood. His bearing of a
 Great Dao Supreme was nowhere to be seen. Han Jue smiled but didn’t reply. He touched Chu Xiaoqi’s head and smiled. “Cultivate well. Grandpa thinks highly of you.”


 Blank Domain.
 The five Dao Creators looked at the dark pillar of light ahead and heaved a sigh of relief.
 Although they didn’t know what had happened, the power contained in the dark pillar of light was really terrifying. It was enough to destroy all existence in the Endless Era.
 As the dark pillar of light dissipated, the crack in the blank domain also began to shrink. The five Dao Creators spied on the situation below, but their divine sense suffered a backlash from the basic rules and forced them back.
 !!
 It was the Lord!
 On the other side.
 Han Jue had already returned to the third Dao Field. As for Chu Xiaoqi, he didn’t send him back. Instead, he helped him regain control of his body, then he let him face Ji Xianshen and the other two.
 The Ninth Chaos asked, “Could the previous battle be…”
 “Yes, I’ve already killed him,” Han Jue said calmly. He was no longer a new Creator Lord. Killing a Dao Creator was not difficult, but he was afraid that the Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil still had a backup plan.
 The reason why he told Chu Xiaoqi that he couldn’t kill a Dao Creator was to maintain their divine might and give him the motivation to advance.
 If the difference was too great, it was very difficult to have any desire to pursue it.
 The Ninth Chaos was shocked. The iron rule that Dao Creators couldn’t be killed shattered in his heart.
 He said in a low voice, “Other than the known Dao Creators, there shouldn’t be anyone who can help him. Even if there is, you can definitely deduce them.”
 Han Jue smiled and said, “He’s very strong, already far exceeding peak Dao Creators. You
 should be able to feel it.”
 The Ninth Chaos said in a low voice, “You mean that there’s an unknown force lurking?”
 “Perhaps. Just like the white-haired man we talked about previously. From now on, you will especially investigate your mental demon. How he obtained the power to surpass the Dao Creator Realm is up to you,” Han Jue
 instructed.
 The Ninth Chaos immediately accepted the
 order.
 Then, Han Jue sent him out.
 “Does the Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil have a
 backup plan that can threaten me?”
 [1 quadrillion years of origin lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [No]
 He looked at the Origin Space-time. The future had changed.
ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels The Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil had perished. Ji Xianshen and the other two had suffered a backlash from Chu Xiaoqi in advance, and their path as Dao Creators was severed. Their karma with the three Primordial Fiendcelestials had
 also ended.
 Because the power involved was too strong, be it the future Han Huang or the future Heavenly Venerate Xun, they could not sense the change
 in fate.
 “Without the Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil, who is the white-haired man?”
 Han Jue was curious and thought for a while before slowly closing his eyes.
 In the Origin Space-time.
 Heavenly Venerate Xun’s body was scattered and his soul recondensed. He looked at Chu Xiaoqi in shock.
 extremely strong level. Facing three perfected Great Dao Supremes, he forcefully displayed an invincible appearance.
 “Hahaha! Is this all you’ve got? Can’t you do without a backing?”
 Chu Xiaoqi laughed wildly. Primordial Despair’s
 extremely terrifying.
 Ji Xianshen, Fang Liang, and Heavenly Venerate Xun were silent.
 They were terrified. What did Chu Xiaoqi mean?
 Their backing was gone?
 That mysterious transcendent existence had
 perished?
 “You know who our backer is?” Ji Xianshen asked in a low voice.
 Chu Xiaoqi twisted his neck and smiled. “Of
 course, I know. He’s a very big fellow and is indeed powerful. I was almost frightened to death in front of him. Unfortunately, he’s not my grandfather’s match at all. My grandfather easily suppressed him.”
 Fang Liang couldn’t help but ask, “Who is your grandfather?”
 He had an answer in his heart. Chu Xiaoqi was
 created by Han Huang. Could his grandfather be…
 Chu Xiaoqi said proudly, “Of course, it’s the Lord!”
 Ji Xianshen and the other two were shocked.
 This matter actually alerted Han Jue. They were immediately terrified.
 In their understanding, they didn’t know Han Jue’s attitude towards Primordial Despair and Chu Xiaoqi. They only treated Chu Xiaoqi as an ordinary descendant of the Han family. Even though Chu Xiaoqi was really Han Jue’s grandson, Han Yunjin had given birth to many
 grandsons for Han Jue. Most of them had never seen him with their own eyes.
 It was different now. Han Jue personally made
 a move.
 Why didn’t he warn them?
 Ji Xianshen and Fang Liang panicked. Heavenly Venerate Xun had mixed emotions.
 In his previous life, he had seen how powerful
 Han Jue was. In this life, he worshiped him. This situation of facing Han Jue’s dissatisfaction gave him immense pressure. Chu Xiaoqi didn’t know what they were
 thinking, but the anger in his chest needed to be vented. He raised his right hand and smiled crazily. “Prepare to die. I’ll kill you first before seizing the spatial river under your feet!”
 Terrifying Dharmic powers erupted and overflowed from his palm, condensing into a huge seal above his head. This seal was purple
 and was actually similar to the Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal.
 “Give up!” Ji Xianshen said in a low voice.
 Time divine light burst out from his body and wrapped around Fang Liang and Heavenly Venerate Xun. The three of them transformed
 into a beam of light and entered the spatial river.
 This was the first time Chu Xiaoqi imitated Han Jue’s Mystical Power. He was very excited. He controlled his Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal to crush the River of Space-time. It was instantly dispersed, and the surrounding space began to collapse and shatter.
 …
 Mysterious Domain.
 The Chaotic Consciousness met Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction Venerable.
 The two Dao Creators looked at each other in
 silence. After a long time, the Chaotic Consciousness sighed.
 Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction Venerable
 said, “Let’s pretend that nothing happened. It’s impossible for the Lord to not sense it. Since he didn’t expose us, that means he’s giving us a chance.”
 The Chaotic Consciousness said, “I think so
 too.”
 Although they did not say it, they all felt that
 the Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil might have been defeated.
 The dark pillar of light was definitely the aftermath of the battle between the Ultimate
 The Chaotic Consciousness said, “Our era is
 about to end. More Dao Creators will definitely appear in the future. The momentum of secession is unstoppable. Let’s join forces so that we can take care of each other.” Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction Venerable replied, “Alright, the Primordial Fiendcelestial and the Dao Ancestor are not under our
 control. We have to choose another potential
 future Dao Creator.”
 The Chaotic Consciousness said, “How about choosing to support a descendant of the Han
 family?”


 “Who should I choose? Those who have already grown up or those who have yet to show their potential?” Shi Tian’s Immeasurable
 Destruction Venerable asked. He was very tired and could not be bothered to think too much, so he focused on the Chaotic Consciousness. The Chaotic Consciousness said, “Of course, those who have already grown up. We don’t have time to wait anymore. The earlier we nurture a Dao Creator, the more beneficial it will be to us. Let’s take in Han Liang. His potential is not simple, but he has been silent for hundreds of millions of years. Perhaps this is the best opportunity for us to help him.” Han Liang?
 Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction Venerable nodded slightly. This child was once called the number one genius of the Endless Era and had even cultivated with the Lord. He was
 definitely not bad.
 The two Dao Creators did not say anything else and left.
 Because of the interference of the Ninth Chaos, the Great Dao Supremes didn’t spy on the battle between Han Jue and the Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil. However, that terrifying aura made the mighty figures palpitate. They felt that something big was about to happen.
 In the long years after, those already formed Great Dao Worlds began to develop at a high speed. The retreat of the older generation gave the younger generation a chance to show their talent. Gradually, even Han Huang, the Emperor, the Ultimate God of Punishment,
 Laozi, Pangu, the Holy Mother of Order,
 Formless World, and the other mighty figures
 became ancient legends.
 Another new era had arrived.
 To all living beings, a hundred million years was a long time. To mighty figures, it was only a dream.
 Three hundred million years later.
 Han Jue ended his seclusion. He wanted to enter seclusion for five hundred million years in one go, but his grandson Han Liang came to visit.
 Han Liang had waited for millions of years. During this period of time, he preached the Dao to the disciples of the Dao Field and sparred with his fellow disciples in the simulation trial, making his life very fulfilling.
 all people he cared about.
 Han Liang received his voice transmission and immediately entered the temple.
 He knelt in front of Han Jue respectfully.
 It had been many years. This kid had already
 didn’t visit you before. But you’re always busy cultivating. It’s not good for me to visit more.”
 Han Liang looked up and smiled. Calling him grandfather pulled the two of them closer.
 Han Jue smiled. “Indeed, just once every 500 million years. However, you’ve already left for more than 500 million years.”
 Han Liang was embarrassed. “Aren’t I working hard not to embarrass you? I’ve already established my own Great Dao World. Grandpa, let me tell you, my Great Dao World is impressive. I can actually absorb the unknown power of rules of the blank domain. I didn’t tell anyone about this. I’m only telling you.”
 Han Jue smiled. “So powerful?”
 This kid was indeed not simple.
 Han Liang was the new Fiendcelestial of the
 Endless Era. His potential was not inferior to the Primordial Fiendcelestial. He was catalyzed by the basic rules of the blank domain and contained the instinct to destroy everything. His goal was to eliminate the obstacles in the blank domain, but Han Liang’s personality was very kind. He liked creation more than
 destruction.
 However, creation and destruction were two sides of the same coin.
 Just as Han Liang had said, he had created his
 Great Dao World, but it destroyed the basic rules of the blank domain.
 Han Liang continued to brag. Han Jue was
 happy.
 At least this kid was sensible and would not
 beg him the moment he arrived.
 Han Jue knew at a glance why Han Liang was
 here. The Chaotic Consciousness and Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction Venerable had been helping him recently. Whatever he needed, the two Dao Creators would try their best to satisfy him. This was also the reason why his Great
 Dao World did not attract the fear of the other mighty figures. He had the protection of two Dao Creators and his ancestor was the Lord.
 It was not an exaggeration to say that Han Liang was definitely the most unprovokable existence in the new era.
 Although he was having a good time, he was a little worried.
 There was no love for no reason. What were the
 two Dao Creators plotting?
 After chatting for a while, Han Liang expressed his worry.
 Han Jue smiled and said, “They took the wrong
 refuse if they ask something of you?”
 Han Liang said seriously, “I’m not an ungrateful person!” “Then do as you wish.”
 “Thank you for your guidance, Grandpa, but
 what do you mean by that? Someone among the Dao Creators went against you and was dealt with by you?” Han Liang asked curiously. He was very curious about the Dao Creator level. Han Jue smiled. “It’s not what you think, but I
 can’t tell you. How can a grandson like you ask about your grandpa?”
 “Tch, then can Grandpa tell me if Chu Xiaoqi is really my cousin?”
 Han Liang changed the topic. After defeating Ji Xianshen and the other two, Chu Xiaoqi returned to the Endless Era. However, because
 Now, Chu Xiaoqi had lived in the Primordial
 Han Jue said, “You can say that.”
 Han Liang was deep in thought. “Is there anything else?” “No, but can Grandpa guide me in cultivation
 or spar with me in the simulation trial?” Han Liang chuckled and asked casually. Han Jue smiled. “Really?” “Really! I want to see how far apart I am from
 Grandpa! You’re the strongest Dao Creator!” Silly grandson. I’m not a Dao Creator. Han Jue immediately pulled him into the simulation trial.
 A breath later, Han Liang sat on the ground, panting heavily. He was sweating profusely and his eyes were bloodshot. He looked at him with
 fear.
 “Do you know how far you are now?” Han Jue asked with a smile.
 Han Liang was still in shock and could not
 answer.
 it just facing his serious grandpa. That power…
 Han Liang shivered just thinking about it.
 Han Jue waved his hand, indicating that he could leave.
 Han Liang immediately left. He even forgot to bow. It could be seen how afraid he was. Han Jue chuckled. “Not many people dare to
 He also wanted to show his true strength in front of his descendants. Unfortunately, he did not have the chance. The other descendants did
 not dare to challenge him. Jue felt happy after torturing Han Liang.
 Han
 vivid and cute.


 Han Liang returned to his Great Dao World. He did not even remember how he bid farewell to his grandmothers. He seemed to have lost his soul.
 After returning to his palace, he sat in the spirit pool and looked at his hands.
 He was confused.
 He had always thought that he was very strong. Even if he was inferior to the Dao Creators, he was not that bad. He had never been defeated ever since he attained the Great Dao Supreme Realm. But today, his battle with his grandfather…
 The difference was too great, so great that he almost felt depressed.
 At this moment, a shadow appeared beside him.
 “Your heart is in chaos. Why?”
 This voice belonged to Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction Venerable.
 Han Liang said in a daze, “Great Destruction Venerable, in the eyes of you Dao Creators, is a Great Dao Supreme similar to a mortal?”
 “Of course. A Dao Creator can casually destroy all living beings and recreate them. It looks like there’s only a difference of one realm, but it’s actually worlds apart. If I really have to classify, there are probably dozens of realms apart.
 Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction Venerable smiled, his tone carrying a faint arrogance.
 Although he had failed in the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity, he was still a Dao Creator. No one could kill him. He was an eternal existence.
 Han Liang asked, “Are there strong and weak among the Dao Creators?”
 “Of course. What do you want to ask?”
 “I went to visit Grandpa and sparred with him.”
 “You…”
 Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction Venerable
 was shocked.
 How dare you!
 You know that your grandfather is very strong, but you still asked to spar with him?
 It was only because of their bloodline. If it were him, if any weak living being dared to provoke him, they would definitely die.
 Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction Venerable said helplessly, “Don’t be too ambitious. Your grandfather is stronger than the other Dao Creators, including me.”
 It was more than a little stronger!
 He wasn’t a Dao Creator at all!
 Han Liang’s mood improved.
 He perked up and developed an unprecedented fighting spirit towards the Dao Creator Realm.
 Great Dao World is lacking and how to condense the Supreme Rules!” Han Liang
 urged.
 Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction Venerable
 was satisfied. Previously, Han Liang had been lazy, which gave him a headache.
 It seemed that the Lord had also sensed this, so he taught him a lesson and made him realize
 how weak he was.
 Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction Venerable began to preach the Dao.
 To be personally nurtured by the Dao Creator
 to create a Great Dao World, only Han Liang had such treatment in the entire Endless Era.
 Even the Formless Transcendent Deity would not cultivate with Formless World.
 Five hundred million years passed quickly.
 Han Jue triggered the choice reward again when he was 3 billion years old, but this time, there was no chance to upgrade the system function.
 He didn’t mind.
 The current system functions were only for fun. Only the derivation function was somewhat still helpful.
 As for the Ultimate Origin Fragment, he still had to wait for countless years.
 He could probably easily control the blank
 domain if he gained potential that surpassed the Ultimate Origin Fiendcelestial. He might be able to create more blank domains. Han Jue, the Creator Lord, couldn’t think of anything for the time being.
 Han Jue’s Creation Heaven’s Chosen attempts had already accumulated to 279. He didn’t plan to use them. He would gather a thousand before using them in one go.
 The Creation Heaven’s Chosen happened once every ten million years. A thousand times required ten billion years of accumulation. Now, time was getting faster and faster in his
 eyes. Ten billion years was not far away.
 Han Jue looked at the blank domain. The Primordial Chaos had already given birth to five Supreme Rules, and the Dao Ancestor also had five. However, in this situation, the Primordial Chaos seemed to have surpassed the
 Chaos.
 The mighty figures of the Endless Era were also paying attention to them. From the number, they could determine who could step into the Dao Creator realm earlier. Apart from them, no one else could snatch the
 chance of being the first Dao Creator of the Endless Era from them for the time being.
 Han Ling had only created two Supreme Rules until now. Beside them were the Primordial Ancestor God, the Ultimate God of Punishment, the Holy Mother of Order, Zhao Xuanyuan, and other mighty figures from before the Endless
 After all, they were his disciple, grand-disciple,
 and grandson. Han Jue felt pity for them.
 As for Chu Xiaoqi, he was currently in the Primordial Chaos and had also established his own Great Dao World. He wasn’t far from the Primordial Chaos.
 It was worth mentioning that Chu Xiaoqi and Tang Wan had met.
 However, the two of them were still not
 married. They had already attained the Dao. Love became unimportant, but they were still close friends who pursued the Great Dao together.
 Time was heartless. It ground everything down.
 Han Jue was very satisfied with Chu Xiaoqi’s performance. He didn’t blame Han Huang after he fused with Primordial Despair. The father and son acknowledged each other. His magnanimity made Han Huang even more
 ashamed, and he took good care of him. This move was very clever.
 As long as Han Jue didn’t interfere, more and
 more Dao Creators would appear in the future, but there were restrictions. According to Han Jue’s estimation, the blank
 domain could at most withstand 49 Dao Creators.
 This was the limit!
 Currently, the blank domain could no longer be
 improved. It was endless, but the tolerance of the basic rules was there.
 The so-called Dao Creator’s eternal life was
 maintained by basic rules.
 If not for Han Jue, the Creator Lord, there
 would be more Dao Creators.
 “Looks like only I can break through the blank domain that has already stopped improving.” Han Jue smiled. Then, he looked at the Ultimate Origin World.
 The speed at which the Ultimate Origin World expanded was very exaggerated. It was already the size of more than a million Primordial
 Chaos. The difference was still increasing. One had to know that the current Primordial Chaos was not much different from the Chaos. However, Han Jue couldn’t deduce how long it
 would take for the Ultimate Origin World to cover the blank domain.
 One thing was certain. Han Jue would fight with all living beings in the future. The Ultimate Origin World would definitely
 devour the other Great Dao Worlds. It would be fine if they submitted, but they could only challenge his authority if they were not
 convinced.
 Han Jue looked forward to what all living beings would do at that time.
 [The Ninth Chaos sent you a dream. Do you accept?]
 A notification appeared in front of him. Han Jue silently chose to accept it.
 The dream was the Ninth Chaos’ Dao Field, under an endless tree.
 The Ninth Chaos faced him and first bowed before saying, “Master, recently, when I was cultivating, I dreamed of that white-haired man again. There are some clues this time.’
 Han Jue raised his eyebrows. “What clues?” The Ninth Chaos replied, “He said that he was born as the master of the blank domain. You only occupied his position. From these words, he shouldn’t have been born yet. Perhaps it’s related to the will of the blank domain. If the Chaos can give birth to a will, so can the blank
 domain.”
