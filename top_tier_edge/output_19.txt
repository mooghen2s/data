 Han Jue adjusted his state of mind, closed the emails, and began to observe the Immortal World.
 Ancestor Xitian’s encounter made him even more concerned about the Heavenly Dao.
 Ever since they couldn’t lead the way and entered the Chaotic Heavenly Road, more and more cultivators began to step onto the Chaotic Heavenly Road to search for the unknown opportunity.
 Although the Immortal World was expanding, the area was only so big. It couldn’t keep up with the speed at which the number of living beings increased.
 The growth of the mortal world also began to slow down. The mighty figures discovered that when they opened up a new world, the Spirit Qi was far inferior to the previous mortal world. This meant that the number of mortal worlds the Heavenly Dao could tolerate was about to reach its limit.
  It had to be known that a mortal world was not as simple as a continent. It would produce the corresponding void, just like the universe where Earth was.
 Tens of thousands of mortal worlds and tens of thousands of universes required an immeasurable amount of Spirit Qi.
 Han Jue’s gaze landed on the netherworld.
 The workload of reincarnation was far greater than before. Even the number of ghost servants had increased greatly. As far as the eye could see, there were already dozens of halls of the King of Hell. There were also many bridges above the Yellow Spring. The line in front of each bridge was like a long dragon that stretched for hundreds of miles.
 The Calamity Race and the Heavenly Race also had a marriage alliance, making the two races even more harmonious.
 Everything looked so harmonious and smooth.
 Han Jue suddenly discovered that Empress Houtu had yet to return.
 Had she given up on reincarnation?
 Thinking about it carefully, reincarnation was probably already a burden to her.
 The order of reincarnation had already been established and she did not need to control everything. However, she couldn’t advance further and was even restricted by the cycle of reincarnation.
 The reason why she attained the Dao was probably that she had severed the karma of reincarnation.
 Han Jue looked at his disciple, Su Qi.
 Indeed!
 Su Qi’s reincarnation providence far exceeded that of the past. It was not inferior to Empress Houtu’s.
 It seemed that Empress Houtu had chosen Su Qi as her successor.
 Han Jue showed a frown.
 This kid had some tricks up his sleeve.
 Han Jue had no intention of asking. Su Qi had already grown up and had the ability to take charge. How could he care about him like a baby?
 Han Jue’s gaze continued to move and he arrived outside the netherworld.
 Primordial Origin.
 He was still asleep. The coffin did not move. The Primordial Chaos Tablet stood in front of the coffin, unaffected by the passage of time.
 This fellow would probably wake up after transforming into a Primordial Fiendcelestial.
 Han Jue was suddenly curious.
 He began to use the derivation function and asked in his mind, “How long until he succeeds?”
 ‘[200 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [Unable to transform successfully]
 Eh?
 ‘It can’t succeed?
 Then why?
 Han Jue continued to ask.
 ‘[It involves karma that surpasses the current limits of the system. It cannot be deduced.)
 Han Jue understood. It seemed that there were supreme rules restricting him again.
 He couldn’t help but mourn for Primordial Origin. This fellow probably did not know his fate and was destined to fail.
 That was good.
 If this fellow really became a Primordial Fiendcelestial and was so close to the Heavenly Dao, he might find trouble with the Heavenly Dao. Even if he didn’t, it would attract many troubles.
 He had to reach the Great Dao Sage Realm first!
 …
 Outside the 33rd Heaven, Sage Dao Field.
 He opened his eyes and sighed.
 “This cultivation speed is really too slow. It’s almost stagnant.”
 Huang Zuntian looked depressed.
 If he didn’t know Han Jue and Pan Xin, he might be satisfied.
 However, this was human nature. As long as he saw something better, he would definitely be indignant.
 He could only rely on him now.
 As long as he worked for Han Jue in peace, he believed that he would not mistreat him.
 After attaining the Dao, he tried to mention Han Jue to Sect Master Tian Jue and asked about his attitude towards him. In the end, he was reprimanded severely by Sect Master Tian Jue and wasn’t allowed to say anything about Han Jue. The reverence in his words deeply agitated Huang Zuntian.
 He was certain that the reason why he attained the Dao was definitely because of Han Jue. Sect Master Tian Jue was not that close to him in the past!
 What could he do to help him?
 A voice suddenly entered Huang Zuntian’s ears.
 Huang Zuntian frowned and dispersed his Sage Sense. He did not find anyone else.
 “Your potential has already reached the limit. If you want to climb higher, you have to break down and rebuild.”,
 The voice sounded. Huang Zuntian had never heard this voice and found it extremely unfamiliar.
 “The Heavenly Dao Sage is only a scam set up by the Dao Ancestor. It’s not impossible to use strength to attain the Dao. I can help you transform and let you surpass the entire Heavenly Dao.”
 Huang Zuntian frowned even more and said in a low voice, “Who are you?”
 “Come find me… I’ll wait for you…”
 With that, Huang Zuntian seemed to have understood something. His gaze involuntarily landed on a coffin outside the netherworld.
 It was that thing!
 Huang Zuntian had heard from Sect Master Tian Jue that the coffin was very dangerous and that he should not approach it easily.
 For some reason, Huang Zuntian’s unwillingness to cultivate futilely began to magnify and quickly occupied his heart.
 However, he was still a Sage. He instantly came to a realization and broke out in cold, sweat.
 What kind of existence was the other party?
 Just words alone could bewitch his heart!
 Huang Zuntian looked at Primordial Origin’s coffin again and had the urge to explore it.
 Should he go take a look?
 It was near the Heavenly Dao. What could happen?
 Huang Zuntian gritted his teeth and decided to take a look. He could use his clone first while his main body stood in the range of the Heavenly Dao. He had to be attacked.
 With that, he slowly stood up and disappeared.
 …
 Five thousand years passed in the blink of an eye.
 Han Jue opened his eyes. His aura became ethereal as if it would disappear at any time.
 The Dao was illusory and everywhere, but there was nowhere to find it.
 “Hmph…”
 Han Jue exhaled and his eyes became clear.
 It was still lacking!
 Han Jue checked the emails, wanting to divert his attention.
 [Your good friend Huang Zuntian was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure and his body was destroyed.)
 [Your good friend Ancestor Xitian was destroyed by a mysterious array formation. His Great Dao was stripped away.)
 [Your disciple Zhou Fan was attacked by ‘Chaotic Demons] x7821023
 [Your good friend Empress Houtu was cursed by a mysterious curse.]
 [Your good friend Huang Zuntian has fused with a mysterious mighty figure. His cultivation has increased greatly.)
 [Your son Han Tuo accidentally entered the Chaotic Dao Origin. His cultivation has increased greatly.]


 Eh?
 Something had happened to Huang Zuntian?
 He looked around the Immortal World and his gaze quickly landed on Primordial Origin’s coffin.
 Huang Zuntian’s aura disappeared near the coffin!
 Could it be that the one who attacked Huang Zuntian was Primordial Origin?
 Han Jue frowned. He knew that it was impossible for Primordial Origin to transform into a Primordial Fiendcelestial. In order to avoid trouble, would this fellow possess Huang Zuntian and infiltrate the Heavenly Dao?
  It was very likely!
 Han Jue immediately sent a dream to Huang Zuntian.
 Huang Zuntian and Primordial Origin had already fused. He had to know if he was the one controlling Huang Zuntian now.
 In the dream.
 Huang Zuntian opened his eyes. Seeing Han Jue, he immediately became excited. “Master!”
 Huang Zuntian knelt down.
 Hearing this word, Han Jue relaxed a little, but he became nervous again. If Primordial Origin possessed Huang Zuntian, it was really possible to read his memories.
 Han Jue asked, “Are you still yourself?”
 Huang Zuntian was stunned. Then, he revealed a look of admiration. “You’ve already calculated it? That’s right. I fused with a mighty figure, but it’s only a physical fusion. I’ll obtain his physical potential. He’ll be covered by my soul and hide from his enemies.”
 Han Jue sized him up. “Do you believe him?”
 Huang Zuntian said, “He shared his memories with me.”
 “In other words, you also shared your memories with him?”
 Han Jue’s expression was a little cold, scaring Huang Zuntian so much that he hurriedly explained, “I’ve long erased your past with me. I only remember it when I see you. You’re my master. It’s already my instinct. It’s like my instinct to live. It has nothing to do with memories.”
 “So that mighty figure doesn’t know.”
 Han Jue’s expression softened, but he still didn’t believe it.
 There was such a thing?
 This sounded too good to be true!
 Han Jue asked, “Then, how can you be sure that he won’t harm you? If it were you, would you be willing to do this?”,
 Huang Zuntian was silent.
 He was shocked.
 Han Jue said, “If you’re worried, you can look for me.”
 With that, he waved his sleeve to remove the dream.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and asked in his mind, “Is what Huang Zuntian said true?”
 (3 billion years of lifespan will be consumed. Do you want to continue?)
 Continue!
 [It’s true.]
 Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief and looked at Huang Zuntian in a different light.
 No wonder this fellow was so strong at rising in ranks. He actually had such a skill.
 Han Jue could also erase his own memories, but being able to remember someone upon contact after forgetting their identity was ridiculous.
 However, since Huang Zuntian was fine, he did not care.
 If this fellow came to find him, he would definitely help. If he didn’t, it would depend ‘on Huang Zuntian’s own luck.
  Everyone had their own fate.
 Han Jue still had expectations for Huang Zuntian. This fellow could always survive and live well.
 In the previous calamity, how many geniuses had better talent? However, the one who did the best was Huang Zuntian, no one else!
 Even Li Daokong and Fang Liang were inferior to Huang Zuntian.
 Han Jue looked at Xing Hongxuan.
 His youngest son was still being nurtured.
 At this rate, even if his mother became a Pseudo-Sage, he might not be born.
 Han Jue thought for a moment and appeared at Xing Hongxuan’s side. He pretended to be concerned but was actually purifying her.
 Xing Hongxuan was also worried. How long would it take for this child to be born?
 She suddenly felt that Han Jue was really good. He looked indifferent, but when facing his own flesh and blood, he would also show his true emotions. After the Absolute Purification ended, Han Jue left.
 Xing Hongxuan was filled with sweetness as she continued cultivating.
 After Han Jue returned to his Daoist temple, he also entered cultivation.
 He wanted to attain the Great Dao as soon as possible!
 …
 Five thousand years passed in the blink of an eye.
 Another catch-up?
 Han Jue wanted to refuse, but after thinking about it, Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du had already informed him. He still had to give him face.
 If not for Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du controlling the Heavenly Dao, it would not have developed so smoothly.
 Han Jue first scanned the 33rd Heaven. The Sages were all here and there were no unfamiliar experts.
 Huang Zuntian had also returned. His cultivation level had actually increased greatly. It seemed that Primordial Origin had helped him greatly.
 Han Jue moved into the Universal Hall, and the other Sages arrived one after another. Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du probably informed him first.
 Not long after, the Sages gathered.
 Huang Zuntian didn’t look at Han Jue, as if the two of them weren’t familiar with each other.
 The Sages stared at Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du, even Pan Xin.
 The person in charge of the Sage circle was Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du. When Pan Xin returned, he wanted to fight for power. Later, he realized that he was far inferior. He would ask Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du for his opinion on many things. Unknowingly, he began to follow him.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “It has been more than 200,000 years since the Heavenly Dao restarted. We should make plans for the next Immeasurable Calamity.”
 Immeasurable Calamity!
 Han Jue frowned. He originally thought that after the Heavenly Dao began to expand, the Immeasurable Calamity would be delayed or even canceled.
 The reason why the Immeasurable Calamity existed was that the Heavenly Dao could not withstand too many living beings. However, when resources were scarce, the conflict between all living beings would accumulate. The Sages would push for it and could use the opportunity of the Immeasurable Calamity to eliminate most living beings, causing the Heavenly Dao to restart.
 Such an Immeasurable Calamity was actually meaningless. It was fine if there was only the Heavenly Dao in the Chaos, but there were still the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End, the Ancient Desolate, and other Little Heavenly Dao. This also caused the Flame Race and the Calamity Race to almost overturn the entire Heavenly Dao.
  The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate was the first to ask, “Is that necessary? A normal Immeasurable Calamity requires hundreds of millions of years of accumulation. Furthermore, the current Heavenly Dao is developing well. There might not be an Immeasurable Calamity in the future.”
 Pan Xin nodded. “Instead of thinking about the Immeasurable Calamity, why don’t you think about the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity? It will sweep through the entire Chaos.”
 The other Sages agreed
 . Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “The Heavenly Dao is different from the past. The Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity is naturally also different from the past. It’s no longer to reduce living beings but to encourage more geniuses and people with great providence to be born. Moreover, it’s not a good thing to have peace for too long. It’s easy to slack off and accumulate mental pressure.
 “Peace is only on the surface. The disciples of the various providence sects can still use other methods to bully all living beings.”
 The Sages nodded. They actually sensed this situation, but they could not resolve it. If the providence sect was not superior, how could they attract more living beings to join them?
 Absolute fairness and peace did not exist.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du continued, “Next, we have to choose the force that will give birth to the Son of the Immeasurable Calamity. With him as the protagonist, we will create a golden age where geniuses will appear. At that time, Sages are not allowed to interfere and create an environment where geniuses fight.”


 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du shook his head. “There’s no limit to the Son of the Immeasurable Calamity for the time being. If we specify the Son of the Immeasurable Calamity, how will we weigh it? It will be troublesome. Why don’t we give all living beings a chance? The times will create heroes. There’s no need to be monopolized by the Sage Sects like in the past.” The Sages nodded.
 There were already many Sages now. If it really came down to it, some Sages would always fall behind. Just thinking about it was painful. Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du reminded, “At that time, the Son of the Immeasurable Calamity will be born. You can recruit him, but you can’t force him or threaten him. This is for the good of the Heavenly Dao. Once a Sage schemes, it will definitely destroy the balance. “We’ve planned for so long. We should work hard for cultivation. In the future, the Heavenly Dao Sages will definitely not be top-notch existences of the Heavenly Dao. We have to continue climbing and forever walk in front of all living beings.”
 The Sages nodded.
 Han Jue didn’t interrupt, but he still agreed with Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du.
 Internal strife would consume their strength. Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du did not say anything more about the Son of the Immeasurable Calamity. He didn’t know who could stand out and kill his way out.
  In the end, the Sages chose to vote.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “I choose the Heavenly Race.” Shi Dudao raised his hand in agreement. Pan Xin followed, “I choose the Famous Race.”
 It seemed that he was already in control of the Famous Race.
 Emperor Xiao and Jin Shen raised their hands in agreement.
 The remaining Sages looked at each other.
 Han Jue said, “The Human Race.”
 Li Daokong, Fang Liang, Heavenly Venerate Wufa, Sect Master Tian Jue, Qiu Xilai, and Huang Zuntian raised their hands in agreement. The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate glanced at Sect Master Tian Jue and still chose to raise his hand.
 Updates by
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du was calm.
 Pan Xin looked at Han Jue in surprise. Han Jue didn’t interrupt the previous discussion, He thought that he didn’t want to interfere, but he didn’t expect this fellow to directly make a choice.
 Most importantly, most of the Sages chose to agree with him. He had always thought that Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du had the greatest say in the circle of Sages. Now, it seemed that this was not the case.
 “This kid…”
 Pan Xin had no choice but to size Han Jue up again.
 Han Jue used the system to hide his cultivation level at the Heavenly Dao Sage level, but Pan Xin had heard that this fellow was already a Freedom Sage.
 Han Jue ignored Pan Xin’s gaze. Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du also decided that the Son of Calamity would appear in the Human Race.
 As for whether it was born or reincarnated, that would depend on the providence of the Heavenly Dao. After the discussion, Han Jue stood up and left.
 “Little Friend Han, shall we have a chat?” Pan Xin came over and chuckled.
 Little friend?
  Han Jue smiled. Even Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du had to call him Fellow Daoist Han. Pan Xin still wanted to take advantage of him.
 Qiu Xilai smiled. “Fellow Daoist Pan, watch your words. We’re all Sages. We have to be on the same level. If word gets out, won’t we be a joke?”
 Sect Master Tian Jue, Heavenly Venerate Wufa, Li Daokong, and the others agreed. Pan Xin’s smile froze. He had only said it unintentionally. He didn’t expect to be surrounded.
 Huang Zuntian and Jin Shen understood.
 The center of the so-called Sage circle was the Sect Master of the Hidden Sect. As for Pan Xin, he had yet to truly integrate into the Sage circle.
 Han Jue said, “Fellow Daoist Pan, I have no intention of participating in the affairs of the Heavenly Dao. If you have something to say, discuss it with the other Sages.” With that, he returned to the Hundred Peak Immortal River. Sitting on the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus again, Han Jue was secretly pleased. It felt quite good to do one thing in front of others and secretly plot behind their backs.
 No wonder the Sages were so sanctimonious.
 Ever since the Sages confirmed that the Son of the Immeasurable Calamity would appear in the Human Race, the providence of the Human Race had also begun to rise. The various Sage Sects were deliberately supporting the Human Race. The footsteps of the Human Race began to expand. The entire Immortal World was built with human cities. At this rate, the Human Race would reach an unprecedented peak. At the same time, the Chaotic Heavenly Road also began to be recognized by all living beings. Cultivators kept returning, and all sorts of knowledge about the Chaos began to spread.
 There was still a threshold to the Chaotic Heavenly Road.
 Only Immortal Emperors could enter.
 It couldn’t be helped. Creatures below the Emperor Realm couldn’t survive in the Dark Forbidden Zone.
 Year after year passed. The Human Race dynasties appeared one after another. The Human Emperor cultivated in seclusion all day and conferred power to the Human Race, causing more and more kings and emperors to appear. Where there were people, there were battles.
 There were always some ambitious people who ignored the peace that the Sages had painstakingly managed. When the various dynasties continued to expand their territory and bordered the other dynasties, war would inevitably erupt.
 Han Jue didn’t know all of this. Even if he knew, he wouldn’t care. When the five thousand years were up, Han Jue slowly opened his eyes. He could feel that he was getting closer and closer to the Great Dao Realm.
 He looked forward to the Great Dao Realm even more.
 In a good mood, he began to check his emails.
 In the depths of the chaos. A woman in a white dress emitting a dazzling light walked forward. Her face was beautiful and holy. A snake tail could be seen under her dress.
 It was Nüwa.
  Nüwa held a jade bottle and flew all the way, sprinkling Seven-Colored Divine Water from it.
 Countless meteors floated in this domain. When the meteors were irrigated by the Seven-Colored Divine Water, they quickly turned into a continent. Countless flowers and plants sprouted. The entire process was extremely magical. After an unknown period of time, Nüwa landed on a stone platform. In the center of the platform stood a man. It was Fuxitian.
 Fuxitian smiled. “Is there a need to be so anxious?”
 Nüwa shook her head and said helplessly, “Time waits for no one. We don’t know what’s hidden in the Ancient Desolate at all. I have a feeling that the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity isn’t from the Primordial Fiendcelestial, but the Ancient Desolate.”
 Fuxitian frowned. “You mean that Teacher lied to us?”
 Nüwa did not reply.
 Fuxitian frowned even more.


 “Han Jue? How is that possible?!”
 Moved, Fuxitian subconsciously rejected it.
 Nüwa sighed. “This child is only 200,000 years old and is already trying to break through to the Great Dao Realm. I suspect that he’s not a variable at all, but…”
 “But what?” Fuxitian asked. He was shocked.
 The Great Dao Realm!
 There were not many Great Dao Sages in the entire Chaos!
  As long as he stepped into the Great Dao Realm, he would be indestructible and escape karma!
 Nüwa asked meaningfully, “Who said that Han Jue is a variable?”
 Fuxitian was moved. “Teacher…”
 “That’s right. Teacher disappeared after Han Jue appeared. Don’t you think all of this is too coincidental?”
 Nüwa sighed. Their teacher was naturally the Dao Ancestor.
 Fuxitian’s eyes flickered. “You mean to say that Han Jue is actually Teacher’s reincarnation?”
 “That’s right. If Teacher didn’t mention that Han Jue can change the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity, would we have roped him in? Thinking about it now, the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End has schemed against the Heavenly Dao many times. The Heavenly Dao has always been able to avert the danger with Han Jue’s help. Every time, it was just right. The stronger the experts we send out, the stronger Han Jue became. In addition to his unbelievable cultivation speed, it can only be Teacher. Because his cultivation level is transcendent, to begin with, it’s a cultivation level that even we Great Dao Sages can’t see through. Therefore, it’s reasonable for him to reincarnate and cultivate again without any cultivation level obstruction.”
 Nüwa’s words made Fuxitian feel a lingering fear.
 He recalled the scene when he interacted with Han Jue. His temperament was indeed indifferent. He was even shining with divine light and pretending to be mysterious.
 Gradually, the figure of the Dao Ancestor and Han Jue began to overlap in Fuxitian’s mind.
 The more Fuxitian thought about it, the more afraid he became.
 Could it be that the Dao Ancestor saw his schemes?
 Nüwa consoled him. “There’s no need to worry. Teacher must be worried about something.”
 Fuxitian’s nervous expression softened.
 In a dazzling Buddhist hall, Jie Yin suddenly opened his eyes.
 He had a strange expression.
 Jie Yin thought silently.
 If Han Jue was not the Dark Forbidden Lord, wouldn’t his cultivation speed be too ridiculous?
 What was his identity?
 He remembered hearing Qiu Xilai mention that Han Jue was a variable.
 In other words, at least the Dao Ancestor knew Han Jue’s background.
 Jie Yin suddenly felt that the Heavenly Dao was covered by a fog, making him unable to see clearly.
 When Jie Yin thought of the Dao Ancestor, his eyes suddenly widened.
 Could it be…
 That was very likely!
 Such a breakthrough speed was simply unprecedented. Even if Pangu was reborn, his cultivation speed could not be so exaggerated!
 “Teacher… As expected of you…”
 Jie Yin sighed silently.
 I see.
 How ridiculous!
 Jie Yin sneered and felt sad.
 Han Jue didn’t know that the other Great Dao Sages knew that he was about to break through.
 Although the Chaos was huge, there were very few Great Dao Sages. Every time a Great Dao Sage was born, it would be a sensational matter.
  Back then, Guan Bubai was discovered by the Great Dao Sages. However, Han Jue was hiding in the Hundred Peak Immortal River. Even if the Great Dao Sages wanted to find trouble with him and kill him in the cradle, it was all a fantasy.
 Even if he was found, Han Jue was not afraid.
 The defensive power of the Dao Field’s array formation was supreme!
 Han Jue nodded after reading the emails.
 Apart from Divine Lord Peacock who was still chasing after the Curse Fiendcelestial, the entire circle of friends seemed to be actively improving. Even the Evil Heavenly Emperor and Han Tuo did not cause trouble. They were all cultivating diligently and had all sorts of opportunities. They looked very good. Han Jue closed the email and looked at Xing Hongxuan.
 My child is really impressive.
 Han Jue thought sinisterly.
 Of course, it was only a thought. This name would not only embarrass his youngest son but also him.
 In the Immortal World, mountains rose and fell.
 “Waa—”
 The cry of a baby resounded through the forest, extremely loud.
 Boom!
 The forest shook violently as surging Spirit Qi surged in one direction, forming a visible hurricane in the air.
 A pillar of light descended from the sky, piercing through the clouds and landing on a wooden house in the forest.
 A man in cloth garments stood in front of the wooden house. He was so frightened that he fell to the ground and subconsciously crawled back.
 He suddenly thought of something, and the fear on his face was replaced by worry. He immediately got up and rushed towards the wooden house enveloped by the pillar of light.
 “Madam!”
 The man cried out miserably. As soon as his body collided with the pillar of light, he instantly turned into dust.
 The baby’s cry was still echoing.
 After an unknown period of time, the Spirit Qi of Heaven and Earth calmed down. The pillar of light disappeared, and so did the cries.
 Creak
 The door opened and an old woman walked out with a swaddled baby. She said happily, “Dalang, it’s a son! It’s a son!”
 After she walked out of the wooden house, she looked around and realized that there was no sign of Dalang.
 She was stunned.
 Could it be that Dalang was frightened away?
 The old woman looked down at the swaddled baby and realized that he was already asleep. Her red face revealed a smile that made all women in the world soften.
 The old woman looked worried.
 This child was extraordinary. If the phenomenon just now spread, he would definitely be treated like a freak.
 He would even be accused of being the reincarnation of a demon!
  However, the old woman knew that he was not a demon because his mother was facing difficult labor just now. His mother died just as he was born.
 However, at that moment, the baby opened his eyes and shot out two golden lights that shone on his mother. It actually allowed his mother’s injuries to recover, and she gradually became alive.
 This was definitely a divine child, an immortal child!
 The more the old woman thought about it, the more affectionate she became.
 At this moment!
 A gust of wind descended, startling the old woman so much that she looked up. Immediately after, her eyes and her mouth subconsciously widened.
 A five-clawed golden dragon poked its head out of the sea of clouds. Its eyes were even larger than mountains, and its body seemed to occupy the entire sky. It was extremely shocking


 “Dragon… Dragon…”
 The old woman looked at the dragon head that emerged from the sea of clouds and stammered.
 Her arms trembled. Fortunately, she maintained her last bit of rationality and hugged the child tightly.
 The five-clawed golden dragon looked down at the old woman with cold eyes.
 Just as the old woman was about to collapse, the five-clawed golden dragon suddenly transformed into a golden light and quickly shrank before falling.
 The old woman hurriedly retreated in fear. The golden light landed in front of the wooden house and transformed into a golden halberd. The blade pierced into the soil. The golden spear trembled slightly and looked extremely handsome under the sunlight.
 “Waa—”
  The swaddled baby suddenly wailed. Its voice was even louder than before.
 He raised his hands and waved them in the direction of the golden halberd as if he wanted it.
 The old woman looked at him and then at the golden halberd. She couldn’t help but be stunned.
 Although she was a mortal, she knew that she was in trouble.
 This child was definitely the reincarnation of an Immortal God!
 Twenty years later.
 In the wilderness, a strong young man was brandishing a golden halberd.
 He wore a robe supported by tiger skin. His movements were ferocious and filled with strength. He was handsome, but there was a sinister aura around him. His slightly messy long hair scattered in the wind, and his eyes were red. He was very terrifying.
 Several hundred meters away, a woman walked down the mountain path. On her right arm was a bamboo basket containing all sorts of fruits.
 She waved at the muscular youth and shouted, “Ling’er, it’s time to go home and eat.”
 The muscular youth paused and suddenly turned around. He transformed into a gust of wind and arrived in front of the woman in the blink of an eye, taking the bamboo basket from her.
 “Mother, I’ve already said that you don’t have to go up the mountain. Although I’ve killed all the ferocious beasts and demon beasts nearby, the mountain is steep. What if you fall and get injured? Besides, this amount of food is not enough to even fill the gaps between my teeth,” the muscular youth grumbled.
 His name was Qin Ling. He was already twenty years old this year. With his extraordinary talent, even if he didn’t know any cultivation techniques, his physical strength still increasing day by day. Two years ago, he had tried to sever a small mountain that was hundreds of feet tall. It was world-shaking.
 The woman smiled. “I know, but I can’t stay idle.”
 The mother and son began to talk as they walked.
 She began to nag.
 Qin Ling frowned and was a little unhappy. He had been with his mother since he was young and had a strong resistance to relatives.
 The woman shook her head. “Ling’er, don’t you know how big the world outside is? Powerful cultivators can fly into the sky and enter the ground. They can pluck the stars and move the moon. Can you do that?”
 Qin Ling was speechless.
 “In addition, don’t you want to find your father? You have to go out sooner or later. While you’re young, you can rely on your potential to obtain an advantage. Otherwise, when Mother dies of old age, you will be delayed if you go out,” the woman said worriedly.
 At the mention of his father, Qin Ling couldn’t help but clench his fists, his eyes filled with anger.
 His father had always been a sore point.
 He did not understand why his father had abandoned them.
 When he was young, he had sworn that he would find his father and ask him.
 He wanted his father to regret it!
 At this moment, a white cloud flew over from the horizon. It was very fast. Looking carefully, a gray-robed middle-aged Daoist was standing on the cloud. He held a wooden staff and looked very sagely.
 He quickly landed in front of Qin Ling and his mother. Qin Ling was so shocked that he stood in front of his mother.
 This was the first time Qin Ling saw someone riding a cloud.
 “What do you want?” Qin Ling asked in a low voice.
 The gray-robed Daoist sized him up with surprise.
 What powerful blood essence!
 Amazing!
 The gray-robed Daoist smiled. “I’m a Loose Immortal of the world. I traveled the myriad worlds and was passing by this place when I sensed your blood essence and felt that your potential was not bad. Are you willing to acknowledge me as your master? I’ll bring you to cultivate and pursue longevity.”
 Qin Ling frowned.
 The woman hurriedly said, “Thank you for your kind intentions, Immortal. My son already has a master. I’m afraid he can’t acknowledge you as his master.”
 She had already introduced her son to the family, so she naturally would not hand him over to unfamiliar cultivators.
 The gray-robed Daoist frowned.
 Qin Ling’s eyes burned. “You’re a Loose Immortal? Then, can you fight me and let me sense your strength? Of course, you can’t fly. I can’t fly for the time being.”
 The gray-robed Daoist couldn’t help but laugh. “Of course.”
 Since they could spar, there was hope!
 He wanted to conquer this child with powerful spells!
 von
 as V
 Qin Ling asked his mother to retreat. Although the woman was worried, she understood her son’s personality and could not dissuade him. She could only leave.
 After her mother left, Qin Ling pulled out the golden halberd on his back and rushed toward the gray-robed Daoist.
 The moment the golden halberd appeared, the terrifying murderous aura shocked the gray-robed Daoist until his pupils dilated.
 A Dharma treasure!
 Qin Ling was extremely fast and slashed with his halberd.
 The gray-robed Daoist raised his hand and pointed. His index finger easily blocked the halberd blade. A few centimeters away, his Dharmic powers formed an invisible and firm barrier, causing Qin Ling to feel like he had slashed at an iron wall.
 Qin Ling became excited.
 This was the first time he had encountered an opponent since he was young!
 He attacked crazily. There were no gorgeous spells, and his moves were random. He relied on speed and strength.
 The gray-robed Daoist easily blocked with his finger every one of Qin Ling’s moves.
 However, his smile gradually disappeared.
 He was shocked to discover that this kid was getting stronger and stronger, causing his blood to surge.
 Qin Ling suddenly jumped up and raised his halberd and smashed it down with all his might.
 The gray-robed Daoist caught it with his palm. His Dharmic powers erupted, but he was still sent sliding back. His feet drew two small ravines dozens of feet long on the grass.
 The gray-robed Daoist had no choice but to raise his wooden staff and fight Qin Ling.
 At the same time.
 In the sky, two people were watching the battle from the clouds.
 It was Han Yu and his disciple, Tian Yong.
 Han Yu looked down and asked softly, “Do you see anything?”
  Tian Yong frowned. “There’s something wrong with his body. There’s an extremely domineering power in his body. There’s also something wrong with that halberd. It’s formed by a Deity Realm Golden Dragon.”
 Han Yu sighed.
 If not for Li Daokong’s voice transmission, he wouldn’t have known that such a prodigy had appeared in the Human Race.
 This child was only twenty years old, but he could already fight against immortals. His potential was definitely terrifying!
 “When the battle is over, go down and take this child as your disciple,” Han Yu instructed.
 Tian Yong frowned even more and said, “Master, I don’t want to take in a disciple. I still have to cultivate.”
 Han Yu rolled his eyes. “You take him in and I’ll teach him. Alright?”
