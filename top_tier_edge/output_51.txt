 Han Jue attacked extremely quickly. The Heaven Earth Mystic Yellow World Piercing Sword Finger had already slashed out before the other Sages could react.
 The sword Qi passed through the door of the Universal Hall and entered the Dark Forbidden Zone with unstoppable force.
 The invisible wall of the Heavenly Dao in this direction had been destroyed earlier, so there was no obstruction this time.
 Sword Qi swept through the Chaos!
 It would directly kill the Dao Ancestor!
 In the supreme pillar of light, the Dao Ancestor had yet to walk out. His aura soared crazily. A sword Qi shot out from the Heavenly Dao and drowned him. The supreme pillar of light was severed and the space twisted violently. The scene was illusory and blurry.
 A section of the supreme pillar of light had already been severed after the sword Qi dissipated, and the Dao Ancestor no longer existed.
 In the Universal Hall.
 Han Jue’s expression didn’t change as he stared at the pillar of light that fell from the Supreme Rule.
  The other Sages were the same. The dilapidated void was not far from the Heavenly Dao. Ordinary Heavenly Dao Sages could also see it.
 The Sages secretly heaved a sigh of relief upon seeing Han Jue kill the Dao Ancestor.
 At this moment, the figure of the Dao Ancestor condensed in the supreme pillar of light again.
 Han Jue used the Heaven Earth Mystic Yellow World Piercing Sword Finger to kill the Dao Ancestor again.
 Soon, the Dao Ancestor continued to revive. Han Jue also attacked and repeated this hundreds of times.
 The Sages looked at Han Jue with strange expressions.
 They would have panicked long ago if it were them.
 However, Han Jue actually enjoyed it and even smiled.
 The reason Han Jue persisted was that he could feel that the supreme pillar of light was weakening. It would dissipate sooner or later if this continued.
 “That’s all you’ve got?”
 Han Jue secretly felt disdain.
 He continued.
 After a thousand times, the supreme pillar of light shattered and the Dao Ancestor finally disappeared.
 Peace returned.
 The Universal Hall was silent. All the Sages did not dare to let their guard down.
 He had rejoiced too early.
 In the mysterious space.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor asked, “Senior, is it over?!
 The mysterious giant shadow replied, “I’m not sure. It depends on if the other party still has a backup plan. I have to say, this child…”
 He didn’t say the rest, but the Evil Heavenly Emperor understood.
 “Cough cough, this kid’s determination is indeed extraordinary…” the Evil Heavenly Emperor said awkwardly, his heart filled with pride.
 What was this?
 It seemed dishonest, but this was a life-and-death battle. Could it be that he had to wait for the enemy to fight in their peak state?
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor asked, “Is the previous Dao Ancestor his main body?”
 “Of course not. The Heavenly Dao Dao Ancestor is indeed powerful. If not for him being unable to let go of the Heavenly Dao, he would have long transcended.” The mysterious giant shadow’s words caused the Evil Heavenly Emperor to ponder.
 After a while.
 A top-notch existence among supreme existences…
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor asked, “What about Han Jue?”
 The mysterious giant shadow was silent.
 ….
 In the Universal Hall.
 Pan Xin smiled upon seeing that there was no movement for a long time. “Is it over?”
 The other Sages didn’t reply but looked at Han Jue.
 Han Jue asked in his mind, “Has the Heavenly Dao Calamity ended?”
 (1 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 (No]
 I knew it!
 Han Jue narrowed his eyes and continued to ask in his mind, “Who will attack the Heavenly Dao next?”
 (1 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [20,000 Divine Authority Generals]
 Han Jue showed a frown.
 Doubled?
 “Can I insta-kill twenty thousand Divine Authority Generals?”
 [2 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 (Yes]
 Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief.
 That was good. After all, Han Jue could defeat ten thousand Foolish Sword Sages. They were now the Great Dao Supreme!
 The Foolish Sword Sage claimed that he could fight a hundred Divine Authority Generals. In other words, Han Jue should be able to fight a million Divine Authority Generals!
 Cough cough!
 It sounded ridiculous, but it was the truth.
 Although Han Jue was cautious, he still had a clear understanding of his strength.
 Since he wanted twenty thousand Divine Authority Generals, so be it!
 He had to kill the Primordial Ancestor God and the Chaotic Deities to give up on eradicating the Heavenly Dao!
 Han Jue said, “It’s not over yet, but I’ll let them end it.”
 His tone was light, but it was domineering. The Sages’ blood boiled.
 Qiu Xilai praised him. “The Heavenly Dao has the Divine Might Heavenly Sage. It’s not inferior to any supreme existence in the Chaos. It’s the Heavenly Dao’s fortune.”
 Pan Xin cursed silently. This fellow was too fast at flattery.
 Xu Dudao suddenly knelt down and exclaimed, “Divine Might Heavenly Sage’s merit is immeasurable!”
 The Sages of the Hidden Sect immediately knelt down and praised Han Jue.
 The other Sages had no choice but to kneel down.
 Pan Xin was the same. He secretly glared at Xu Dudao.
 This fellow was too wise!
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du had no choice but to bow again.
 Lao Dan had a strange expression.
 Han Jue frowned. “Don’t do this. The calamity isn’t over.”
 “Yes, yes, yes…”
 The Sages stood up.
 Han Jue was secretly pleased and glanced at Xu Dudao.
 This child had a good future.
 They were also enslaved by the Primordial Heavenly Prison. This was the nature of the other Sages. They were not as hypocritical as Xu Dudao.
 But who did not like to be praised?
 It was the same for Sages.
 At this moment…
 Another pillar of light descended from the Supreme Rules above the three thousand Great Dao. This time, divine authority generals had already condensed before the supreme pillar of light reached the Heavenly Dao.
 In an instant, twenty thousand Divine Authority Generals successfully condensed. Their auras were vast as they rushed towards the Heavenly Dao.
 Too fast!
 It went straight to the Heavenly Dao!
 This scene reminded Han Jue of the drop of water thrown by the Holy Mother of Order in the past.
 This beam of light contained the power of a Great Dao Supreme!
 The Primordial Ancestor God had attacked!
 However, he did not appear. He probably wanted to break through the Heavenly Dao.
 “Ridiculous!”
 Han Jue’s eyes narrowed. The Dharma idol of the Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial condensed above the peak of the Heavenly Dao. His figure was domineering and his face was sinister. He leaned back and pulled the bow. His right fist struck from below.
 This punch contained the ferocious power of the Heavenly Constellation Great Dao!
 Han Jue was already a Great Dao Supreme. Thus, his Dharma idol was also a Great Dao Supreme!
  “Roar!”
 The Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial’s roar was isolated by the Heavenly Dao, but the Sages could hear it.
 They were shocked.
 Compared to Han Jue’s previous strike, the Fiendcelestial Dharma idol’s posture could show Han Jue’s power more clearly!
 With a punch, his aura surged into the chaos!
 The two Supreme Powers collided in the darkness. The strong light that burst out tore through the darkness.
 The Heavenly Dao was not affected.
 Han Jue used his own strength to negate the Primordial Ancestor God’s power.
 The Heavenly Dao did not shatter, but the twenty thousand Divine Authority Generals followed closely behind with an aggressive aura.


 In the Universal Hall, the Sages all looked up and saw twenty thousand Divine Authority Generals attacking. All of them were ten million feet tall, as if the chaotic sky had collapsed!
 Han Jue also looked up and summoned the Primordial Judgment Sword again.
 The Sages were uneasy.
 Yang Che asked carefully, “Has the number of Divine Authority Generals increased?”
 The Divine Authority Generals’ aura was too strong. His Sage Sense burned the moment it touched them. He was so frightened that he hurriedly retracted it.
 “There are indeed more.”
 “Not only more, but they also doubled.”
 “Why is this happening? Is there no end to
 it?”
  “Who is manipulating the Divine Authority Generals?”
 “Why must you destroy my Heavenly Dao?”
Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎 The Sages were indignant. At this moment, they had already forgotten their fear and worry, and only felt endless worry.
 ......
 They couldn’t help but look at Lao Dan.
 Lao Dan sensed their anger and said awkwardly, “Why are you looking at me? How would I know?”
 Han Jue ignored them. He fused with the 1,949 Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols again and was already prepared.
 He raised the Primordial Judgment Sword and pointed the tip at the top of the Universal Hall.
 Han Jue suddenly used the Heaven Earth Mystic Yellow World Piercing Sword Finger when the distance was right.
 Boom
 Sword Qi soared into the sky and shattered it, then quickly rushed out of the Heavenly Dao. Under Han Jue’s deliberate control, the sword Qi didn’t hurt the Heavenly Dao’s foundation and quickly rushed into the darkness.
 Just like before!
 Absolute speed!
 The twenty thousand Divine Authority Generals were still diving down. They were drowned by the sword Qi just as they saw it.
 This speed had already surpassed the definition of speed and time!
 The Divine Authority Generals were all destroyed!
 It was still a sword!
 The vast pressure of the twenty thousand Divine Authority Generals instantly vanished. The Sages were not as surprised as before. They were only happy.
 Han Jue felt uneasy.
 How could that be?!
 With a thought, his will instantly jumped out of the Chaos. He looked down at the Chaos and said, “Ten thousand Divine Authority Generals are not enough for me to kill with a single strike. Twenty thousand is still not enough. Will you send a hundred thousand next? A million? Or ten million?
 His voice spread throughout the Chaos!
 He did it on purpose. Other than the Heavenly Dao lifeforms, all the living beings in the Chaos could hear his voice.
 For a time, the entire Chaos fell into an uproar. Countless living beings were curious about who the voice belonged to. The cultivators who had surpassed the Primordial Chaos Dao Fruit were shocked.
 They all knew that the Divine Authority was about to attack the Heavenly Dao, but from Han Jue’s words, ten thousand Divine Authority Generals had already been destroyed?
 No!
 Twenty thousand Divine Authority Generals were killed by a mysterious mighty figure of the Heavenly Dao?
 Impossible!
 In the Universal Hall.
 The Sages cheered when they heard what Han Jue said.
 Even the usually low-profile Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du was the same. He clenched his fists and shouted, “That’s how it should be! Force out the mysterious existence hiding behind them! What’s with this behavior? After ten thousand, there will be twenty thousand. Is this still a rule? Can the rules change at any time?
 “Besides, what’s wrong with the Heavenly Dao?”
 Actually, the Sages could not understand either.
 Why did the Divine Authority Generals want to clean up the Chaotic Fiendcelestials?
 Who didn’t know that the Chaotic Fiendcelestials were born after the birth of the Chaos? They were equivalent to Chaos children, and the Great Dao Divine Spirits were only the rules of the Chaos. The rules wanted to kill the family’s children?
 It was unreasonable!
 It didn’t make sense!
 Lao Dan looked at Han Jue and sighed slightly.
 He didn’t understand what the other party was thinking
 These words expressed disdain for the Divine Authority and also offended the existence behind it.
 It was not pleasing.
 Why fall out with them?
 It was understandable for them to fall out with each other at the same cultivation level, but how could they survive in the Chaos in the future if they fell out with the existence who controlled the Supreme Rules?
 Han Jue waited patiently.
 Han Jue would be convinced if the number of Divine Authority Generals continued to increase until he couldn’t defeat them.
 You can destroy the Heavenly Dao if you want!
 Taking revenge could also fulfill the Heavenly Dao’s last wish!
 Han Jue was already prepared for the worst!
 At this moment, a cold voice sounded in Han Jue’s mind.
 “You’re the Primordial Fiendcelestial?”
 Han Jue could sense that the other party was a Great Dao Supreme. He immediately searched for the other party’s voice and sent a voice transmission, “I’m a Chaotic Fiendcelestial. But go ahead if you want to call me the Primordial Fiendcelestial. In any case, the Heavenly Dao is innocent and justice is in the hearts of the people. You can destroy the Heavenly Dao, but you can’t destroy everyone’s ambitions!”
 The other party did not reply.
 Han Jue immediately sat down upon seeing that the Divine Authority Generals did not appear again.
 Seeing this, the other Sages also sat down.
 The entire Universal Hall fell silent for a time.
 The Sages stared at Han Jue. They all understood the consequences of his words, but they didn’t blame him and chose to trust him.
 They believed that Han Jue could support them!
 At this moment, the mysterious voice sounded in Han Jue’s mind again.
 “How can a Chaotic Fiendcelestial kill twenty thousand Divine Authority Generals? Even Pangu can’t do it!”
 “Why can’t I? Then, why can you control the Divine Authority Generals?”
 “I can’t deduce your background.”
 “I don’t know who you are, either!”
 “You’ll be a threat to the Chaos if you are a Primordial Fiendcelestial. Perhaps I might be wrong, but would you let go of a possibility if it were you?”
 Han Jue faced the other party confidently.
 However, he did not say anything overboard. He actually already knew who the other party was. It was the Primordial Ancestral God!
 He wanted to pretend not to know and act aggrieved to make the other party let down his guard.
 Then, he would personally kill the Primordial Ancestor God one day.
 He couldn’t be spared with six-star Hatred Points!
 After a long while…
 The other party still did not answer.
  The Divine Authority Generals did not appear again. Everything returned to normal.
 It was as if the calamity had passed.
 However, the Sages didn’t dare to let their guard down. They were all waiting for Han Jue’s answer.
 The mysterious voice sounded in Han Jue’s mind again, “I will no longer target the Heavenly Dao as long as you can prove that you are not the Primordial Fiendcelestial!”
 “How can I prove it?”
 “Enter the Supreme Rules and be sealed by them until the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity ends. You can sacrifice your freedom in exchange for the Heavenly Dao’s peace.”
 Han Jue smiled when he heard this.
 He almost wanted to take out the Book of Misfortune, but he couldn’t use it now.
 The Chaotic Fiendcelestials cared more about the Dark Forbidden Lord than the Primordial Fiendcelestial!


 Sacrificing himself for the Heavenly Dao?
 Impossible!
 Han Jue wasn’t that kind of person!
 Han Jue didn’t receive another reply.
 He was already prepared to face a hundred thousand Divine Authority Generals.
 They had to fight even if it was a dead end. In any case, he had a wisp of will in the Dao Field and was not afraid of death.
 Han Jue cursed in his heart.
  What was Pangu doing?
 He had said that he only needed to block ten thousand Divine Authority Generals. Why was there no end to it?
 A line of words appeared in front of him just as Han Jue thought of Pangu.
 [Pangu sent you a dream. Do you accept?] Accept!
 Han Jue entered the dream. At the same time, he retained half of his will in his body in case the Divine Authority Generals attacked again.
 In the dream, Han Jue saw Pangu.
 it.
 “One, you sacrifice yourself and let the Supreme Rules suppress you in exchange for peace.
 “Two, you fight the Divine Spirits’ leader. The Heavenly Dao and you can both be protected if you win.”
 Han Jue didn’t answer.
 Pangu waited patiently.
 Pangu said, “The one who truly controls the Supreme Rules is an existence that surpasses the Great Dao. Even I can’t say his name or spread his appearance. The Heavenly Dao will really perish if he makes a move.”
 Han Jue showed a frown.
 He was a little disappointed in Pangu.
 From the looks of it, Pangu was not the Chaotic Consciousness’s match. He was at a disadvantage in the negotiations.
 Han Jue said, “You have to start now if you want to challenge the Divine Spirits’ leader?”
 Although he could fight ten thousand Foolish Sword Sages, he might not be able to defeat the Primordial Ancestor God.
 The Primordial Ancestor God was an existence with a perfected Great Dao and was the leader of the Divine Spirits. His cultivation was definitely powerful.
 “I’ll try my best to help you,” Pangu said in a low voice.
 Han Jue tacitly agreed.
 After a while.
 Pangu said, “I can at most help you stall for ten million years. Ten million years later, you will fight alone with the leader of the Divine Spirits. The Supreme Rules will no longer target the Heavenly Dao if you win. But if you lose…”
 Han Jue pretended to be troubled. “Only ten million years?”
 Pangu sighed. “Your growth speed is too fast. Ten million years is already the limit. A billion years would not be a problem if it were anyone else. The leader of the Divine Spirits takes a hundred million years every time he enters seclusion. It’s enough to show how afraid he is of you.”
 Han Jue also sighed. “Alright.”
 “That’s settled.”
 With that said, the dream shattered.
 Han Jue didn’t tell the Sages about this immediately but continued to wait.
 The Divine Authority Generals didn’t appear again, and the Primordial Ancestor God didn’t send any more messages to Han Jue.
 Everything was calm.
 After a long while…
 Pan Xin asked carefully, “It’s over? It’s been so long…”
 The other Sages stared at him.
 Han Jue asked in his mind, “Has this Heavenly Dao calamity ended?”
 (1 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [It’s over for the time being.)
 Han Jue secretly heaved a sigh of relief. It seemed that Pangu had indeed succeeded in negotiating.
 He looked at the Sages and said, “It’s over for the time being. I will fight the leader of the Divine Spirits and resolve the karma for this calamity in ten million years. Before that, the development of the Heavenly Dao will continue as usual. I’ll leave everything to
 you.”
 With that, Han Jue returned to the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 Cheers erupted in the Universal Hall. The words ‘Divine Might Heavenly Sage’ could be heard the most.
 The mysterious domain was filled with fog.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor looked at the illusion in front of him. Not seeing the Divine Authority Generals again, he couldn’t help but ask, “Is this calamity over?”
 He suppressed his excitement and did not dare to look at the mysterious figure.
 The mysterious giant shadow replied, “It’s over for the time being. Ten million years later, Han Jue needs to fight the leader of the Divine Spirits. The Heavenly Dao will survive if he wins, but the Heavenly Dao will be destroyed if he loses.”
 Ten million years?
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor was secretly puzzled. Was the leader of the Divine Spirits so arrogant?
 “Pangu made a move and set a ten-million-year agreement. However, this is also a way to give the Supreme Rules a way out. The Divine Authority Generals are indeed not Han Jue’s match. It’s not good for the leader of the Divine Spirits to appear personally,” the mysterious giant shadow said faintly.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor asked, “What if Han Jue agrees but doesn’t accept the challenge ten million years later?”
 The mysterious giant shadow said, “He will definitely accept the challenge. He has no choice but to accept.”
 These words confused the Evil Heavenly Emperor even more. He hurriedly asked, but the mysterious giant shadow no longer replied.
 “You should leave.”
 The mysterious figure’s voice was illusory.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor bowed and left.
 He had just taken a few steps when the mysterious giant shadow’s voice floated over, “Evil Heavenly Emperor, don’t forget your own fate.”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor did not look back and vanished.
 All ten thousand Divine Authority Generals collapsed near the Heavenly Dao after the Heavenly Dao calamity ended!
 The name of the Divine Might Heavenly Sage shook the entire Chaos. Even countless cultivators in the Heavenly Dao were discussing this.
 Gradually, the news spread throughout the Immortal World. The Divine Might Heavenly Sage became a legend that all living beings worshiped.
 Buddhist World.
 The Sacred True Martial Buddha faced Chu Shiren and remained silent for a long time.
 Chu Shiren asked, “How’s my Grandmaster?”
 Sacred True Martial Buddha said, “Invincible.”
 He looked calm, but his heart was in turmoil!
 That was the ten thousand Divine Authority Generals who had slaughtered the Chaotic Fiendcelestials. They were actually killed by Han Jue with a single strike. They didn’t even touch the edge of the Heavenly Dao!
 It was unbelievable!
 The Sacred True Martial Buddha had lived for so long, but this was the first time he was so shocked. He also felt indescribable reverence for Han Jue.
  Joining the Heavenly Dao might be a huge opportunity!
 The more he thought about it, the more excited he became. He finally smiled.
 In the crimson sky of the endless sea.
 A shining figure stood on the Holy Mother of Order’s shoulder.
 “This child will definitely be stronger ten million years later. Are you confident?” The Holy Mother of Order asked.
 The figure of light snorted. “So what if I give him ten million years? His potential is powerful and can reach the Great Dao Supreme Realm. Do you think it’s possible for him to catch up to me in ten million years?”
 “The reason we set this agreement is because the Divine Authority Generals can’t do anything to the Heavenly Dao. Twenty thousand is already the limit. I even paid a considerable price. I naturally have to take it since Pangu gave me a way out.”
 The Holy Mother of Order asked, “How will you make him accept the challenge ten million years later?”
 The figure of light said, “Watch carefully. He’ll accept the challenge. The Chaotic Fiendcelestials have almost all been eliminated. Only a few are left. A new person with great providence will appear in order to promote the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity. I’ll create momentum for the Divine Might Heavenly Sage and make him unable to cultivate in peace for ten million years. As for the day of the final battle, I have already calculated it. He has to fight. He’ll also die in misery.”


 Outside the 33rd Heaven, Universal Hall.
 The Sages were still gathered here. Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du had already asked Lao Dan to avoid suspicion and leave. The Sages of the Hidden Sect also left when they saw this, leaving only the Heavenly Dao Sages. Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du scanned the Sages and slowly said, “Everyone, the Heavenly Dao Calamity is not over. You should have heard what Fellow Daoist Han said about the ten million years’ agreement. Next, we have to help Fellow Daoist Han strengthen the Heavenly Dao.
 “This battle has already proved that the leader of the Divine Spirits is behind the Divine Authority Generals. We can’t just sit and wait for death. We have to be prepared. We can’t always rely on Fellow Daoist Han.”
 The Sages nodded.
 Although they didn’t attack in this battle, it greatly increased the Heavenly Dao’s cohesion.
 Their Dao hearts were still excited and couldn’t calm down after witnessing Han Jue kill twenty thousand Divine Authority Generals with a single strike.
 “That’s right. In any case, the Heavenly Dao never relies on the Chaos.”
 “Who cares about the Great Dao Divine Spirits? They only know how to play tricks behind our back.”
  “The Divine Authority Generals caused the Chaos to panic. We can deliberately exaggerate and say that the Divine Authority General is a power controlled by the Great Dao Divine Spirits. The Great Dao Divine Spirits are reckless. Previously, it was the Chaotic Fiendcelestials. Other mighty figures will definitely suffer in the future. We can think of a way to set up the Great Dao Divine Spirits as a Chaotic Danger.”
 “I think it’s feasible. In addition, we have to publicize the Divine Might Heavenly Sage’s power. His divine might protects the Heavenly Dao and is invincible. How about that?”
 The Sages began to discuss. This time, Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du did not directly set a plan and let all the Sages participate.
 He seemed to see the rise of the Heavenly Dao!
 The strongest was the leader of the Divine Spirits. Han Jue was not the strongest, but he was still the second in the Chaos!
 Moreover, why would the leader of the Divine Spirits set a time limit of ten million years if he could really defeat Han Jue?
 The more Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du thought about it, the more excited he became, and his reverence for Han Jue deepened.
 He made up his mind to follow Han Jue forever.
 Inside the Daoist temple.
 Han Jue sat on the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus as he recalled the process of this battle and reviewed his words and actions.
 He had already disguised himself as a reckless person who did not care about the Heavenly Dao’s survival. It was unknown if the Primordial Ancestor God and the Chaotic Consciousness believed him.
 No matter what, ten million years was a buffer.
 Han Jue’s strength would definitely reach a new level ten million years later.
 However, Pangu was involved. How could the leader of the Divine Spirits wait for ten million years?
 It was impossible no matter how arrogant he was. After all, Han Jue had already displayed his strength. The Primordial Ancestor God still had six-star hatred towards him.
 He had to find a chance to curse this fellow!
 But it couldn’t be now. It would easily expose his identity.
 He could start cursing him in a million years.
 Han Jue thought silently.
 He had to strengthen the Book of Misfortune if the Heavenly Dao Spirit Stone appeared again in the future. As it became stronger, he believed that as long as the Book of Misfortune was strong enough, it could ignore all obstacles one day.
 Han Jue started the simulation trial.
 He challenged a hundred thousand Great Dao Supreme Realm Foolish Sword Sage!
 After a simulation trial, he calmed down a lot. Realizing his weakness and limits, his anxious heart calmed down.
 Thus, he began to cultivate with a calm heart.
 He still had to cultivate diligently after the glory.
 Everything was deceptive, but cultivation was not!
 He could change everything as long as he worked hard!
 In the dark universe, countless meteors were everywhere.
 Figures sat on a meteor. Among them were Li Daokong, Ancestor Xitian, and Shi Dudao.
 Ancestor Xitian slowly opened his eyes and said, “The Divine Authority is about to be destroyed. We have survived the calamity.”
 Hearing this, all the Lives opened their eyes.
 The Life faction had been leaderless ever since the First Life Black Sovereign’s death. They had also encountered the Divine Authority Generals and had no choice but to hide. All of them felt uneasy and even despair.
 They couldn’t escape the identity of the Calamity Life Controller. Some Life members were already killed by the Divine Authority Generals. How could they be a match for ten thousand Divine Authority Generals? They could only hide.
 Li Daokong looked at Ancestor Xitian with flickering eyes.
 He had already learned about the battle situation of the Heavenly Dao from the Myriad Worlds Projection and was extremely excited.
 “Go on, start bragging!” Li Daokong thought silently.
 Ancestor Xitian said, “Ten thousand Divine Authority Generals attacked the Heavenly Dao and were killed by the Heavenly Dao’s Divine Might Heavenly Sage. You should have heard the previous voice. It’s not arrogance. Not only did the Divine Might Heavenly Sage kill ten thousand Divine Authority Generals, but another twenty thousand Divine Authority Generals were also killed by the Divine Might Heavenly Sage with a single strike.”
 Boom
 Dozens of Lives became excited and even stood up, trembling.
 “Really?”
 “Such a person actually appeared in the Heavenly Dao!”
 “It’s said that the Divine Might Heavenly Sage also killed a Great Dao Divine Spirit when it attacked the Heavenly Dao. This Divine Might Heavenly Sage is too impressive, just like Pangu in the past.”
 “Not only that, Pangu was killed by the Divine Authority Generals when he revived. The Divine Might Heavenly Sage has long surpassed Pangu and became a legend.”
 “Aren’t the Divine Authority Generals under the Chaotic Rule? The Divine Might Heavenly Sage can already ignore the Chaotic Rule?”
 Dozens of Lives were extremely excited and praised Han Jue.
 Although they didn’t know the Divine Might Heavenly Sage, him destroying the Divine Authority Generals was equivalent to saving them. They were naturally happy.
 Speaking of which, the Divine Might Heavenly Sage also had a grudge with Life, but it had nothing to do with them.
 Ancestor Xitian said, “The Divine Authority Generals are gone, but we still have to be careful. I will make plans. It’s time to develop the Life faction again. As for the Divine Might Heavenly Sage, from today onwards, I will treat this as a favor from the Heavenly Dao. Try not to offend him in the future. We’re not the evil existences the Great Dao Divine Spirits make us out to be. We just want to overturn the unbearable and rotten rules of the Chaos.”
 Dozens of Lives nodded. Li Daokong smiled.
 Shi Dudao also smiled.
 “As expected of the Dark Forbidden Lord. How powerful. He has both identities. His methods are also impressive,” Shi Dudao thought in admiration.
 Li Daokong glanced at him and asked, “What are you laughing at? Are you so afraid of death?”
 “Then, why are you smiling?”
 “The Divine Might Heavenly Sage is my Sect Master. Of course, I’m proud.”
 “Hehe, you’ve already betrayed the Hidden Sect. What’s there to be proud of!”
  “I had no choice.”
 Shi Dudao couldn’t be bothered to talk to Li Daokong.
 The Dark Forbidden Lord acknowledges my potential the most!
 Li Daokong thought that he was on the second level, while he was higher.
 He had long seen that Li Daokong was a spy of the Divine Might Heavenly Sage, but Li Daokong did not know his relationship with the Dark Forbidden Lord.
 What did this mean?!
 This meant that in the Dark Forbidden Lord’s eyes, he was the trusted aide. Li Daokong was only the most ordinary pawn.
 Ancestor Xitian said, “Prepare to leave. Since the Life faction is leaderless, we will regain control of it. The Chaos has also quietened down now that all the Chaotic Fiendcelestials have perished. This is Life’s chance!”


 The Heavenly Dao would be the strongest force in the Chaos as long as the Divine Might Heavenly Sage was around!
 At the same time, the Chaotic living beings’ gazes landed on the Heavenly Dao.
 As time passed, if the Heavenly Dao did not encounter any more attacks from the Chaotic Rule, a large number of cultivators would join the Heavenly Dao!
 A place that could guard against the Chaotic Rule. Wasn’t this a Holy Land?
 Just like that, year after year passed.
 A hundred thousand years passed in the blink of an eye!
 Inside the Daoist temple.
  Han Jue opened his eyes and smiled in satisfaction.
 His cultivation level increased again. The Primordial World expanded by nearly twice.
 However, he felt that something was missing.
 He felt that the Primordial World was too empty. He should produce living beings himself.
 ......
 Although the nebulous Primordial Qi was endless and could reproduce Chaotic Fiendcelestials, it had yet to truly create a Chaotic Fiendcelestial alone.
 Han Jue thought for a moment. He lacked the power of creation!
 The power of creation was the strongest rule among the Seven Supreme Rules!
 It could create everything!
 Creation was the most important among the seven great rules!
 Han Jue looked up above the three thousand Great Dao. The mighty Creation Rule was so mysterious and noble. It was fascinating.
 Han Jue’s heart almost sank just looking at it for a while.
 There was a Production Fiendcelestial. He had previously tried to fuse the Great Dao of Production into the Primordial World, but it was quickly drowned by the nebulous Primordial Qi, and a living being could not be created.
 Creation and production seemed to be similar, but they were extremely different.
 Han Jue’s heart skipped a beat.
 “Who created the Chaos?” Han Jue asked in his mind.
 (100 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 So expensive?
 Even the Dao Creator had only cost a quadrillion years!
 A hundred times his value?
 He immediately chose to continue.
 [Ninth Chaos: Cultivation unknown. Spirit of the Primordial Chaos, Creator of the Chaos. It cannot be named and is not affected by any rules. The Primordial Chaos once gave birth to nine Primordial Spirits. The first eight failed. The Ninth Chaos successfully created the Chaos. The number 9 became the extreme number of the Chaos, containing special meaning.)
 There were living beings in the Primordial World?
 Wasn’t there only the Primordial Fiendcelestial?
 Or am I thinking too much?
 Han Jue only saw the notification in front of him, but the figure of Ninth Chaos didn’t appear in his mind. He didn’t know if this fellow was still alive.
 “Can the Ninth Chaos reach the Creation Dominator Realm?” Han Jue asked in his mind.
 Above the Dao Creator was the Creation Dominator Realm!
 He had asked before. There was no such existence, but some time had passed. Perhaps there had been a change.
 (100 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [No]
 That was good.
 At the same time, this also proved that the Ninth Chaos was still alive!
 Han Jue suddenly had an idea.
  Could it be that the Chaotic Deities did not dare to personally interfere in the Chaos because of the Ninth Chaos’ existence?
 Han Jue asked in his mind, “Is the Ninth Chaos restricting the Chaotic Deities’ interference?”
 (100 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [Yes]
 That made sense.
 Han Jue suddenly felt more secure.
 “Is there anyone stronger than the Ninth Chaos?”
 (100 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [Not for the time being.)
 Han Jue smiled.
 The peak finally appeared!
 I’ll be at the peak when I reach the Creator Lord Realm!
 At that time, he could roam freely with no fear!
 I can do whatever I want. Whoever dares to offend me will be killed without consideration for their backing!
 Han Jue was filled with anticipation.

 (Your grand-disciple Chu Shiren spread the Buddhist Dao and his providence increased.]
 [Your good friend Evil Heavenly Emperor created an Inauspicious Deity. His providence has declined.]
 [Your good friend Huang Zuntian was attacked] x572
 [Your son Han Tuo received guidance from a mysterious mighty figure.)
 It was lively again!
 Why are you following these three? Han Jue smiled. He liked Lao Dan even more now.
 The last time in the Universal Hall, Lao Dan had kept a low profile. He had not thought of escaping even when the Divine Authority Generals attacked. He was quite pleasing to the eye.
 He also knew Lao Dan’s goal. He wanted Dao Sovereign and the other two’s potential.
 Han Jue turned a blind eye to this.
 On the path of cultivation, most of them had masters, benefactors, Dao Bearers, and so on. Han Jue was not afraid that Dao Sovereign and the other two would be poached. He was letting them grow on their own.
 Han Jue continued reading. The disciples who had returned had gone out again.
 However, the Buddhist World, the Great Dao Tower, and the Red Fate World were still near the Heavenly Dao. They already had the Heavenly Dao’s providence. They would fuse into the Heavenly Dao sooner or later.
 Han Jue sent a dream to Huang Zuntian after reading the emails.
  It had been too long since they had contacted each other. He had to show concern lest Huang Zuntian change his mind or suffer.
 The dream was in front of the eighteen peaks of the Jade Pure Sect.
 Huang Zuntian opened his eyes and hurriedly bowed when he saw that it was Han Jue.
 “Master, you’re too powerful. That was ten thousand Divine Authority Generals, equivalent to ten thousand Great Dao Sages. It’s said that twenty thousand Divine Authority Generals appeared later. This matter has already spread like wildfire in the Chaos. You’re already the strongest Chaotic Fiendcelestial. There are even rumors that you’re the strongest in the Chaos!” Huang Zuntian said excitedly.
 The strongest in the Chaos!
 Han Jue was secretly pleased. He remained calm and said, “I had no choice. How have you been? Do you need my help?”
 Han Jue listened carefully. Huang Zuntian’s story was indeed legendary. Han Jue felt that it was much more exciting than his. He went from a captive to someone in charge of the Life faction, and he even inherited the Providence Mystical Power of the Calamity Life Controller.
