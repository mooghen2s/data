 Another thousand years passed after Han Yu accepted the woman in green.
 Under his guidance, the woman’s cultivation improved by leaps and bounds.
 Most of the time, Han Yu sat under the old tree and watched the woman in green cultivate her Mystical Power. Such days made him feel good. At least, he was not as lonely as before.
 On this day.
 The green-robed woman had just finished cultivating her Mystical Power. She sat down in front of Han Yu and asked curiously, “Senior, who are you? I heard that the master of Buzhou Divine Mountain was once a supreme expert of the Human Race. He contributed greatly to the Human Race’s current situation.”
 Han Yu did not open his eyes as he replied, “It’s all hearsay. I’m just a cultivator who doesn’t fit in with the mortal world.”
  The woman in green asked, “Then what’s your cultivation level? Deity Realm? Or the legendary Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal?”
 Han Yu said, “You will naturally be able to see through my cultivation when you reach my realm.”
 “I can reach your realm?” the woman in green asked in surprise.
 The woman in green curled her lips. Senior always said such things, thinking that it was impossible for her to take revenge.
 She asked, “When can I reach the Emperor Realm?”
 Han Yu said slowly, “Probably in tens of thousands of years.”
 Tens of thousands of years…
 The woman in green was moved. She gritted her teeth and stood up to the side to meditate.
 The top of Buzhou Divine Mountain regained its calm. Here, there were no traces of time. Everything seemed eternal.
 More than twenty thousand years passed.
 Three lines of words appeared in front of Han Jue.
 (Detected that you are a million years old and your life has taken another huge step forward. You have the following choices:]
 (1: Exit seclusion immediately and preach the Dao to the Chaos, raising the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment, a Creation Spirit Stone, a Heavenly Dao Spirit Stone, and a Great Dao Sage-level guard.]
 [2: Cultivate in a low-profile manner and maintain your true nature. Stay away from trouble. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment, a Creation Spirit Stone, a Heavenly Dao Spirit Stone, and open the third Dao Field.)
 Han Jue’s eyes lit up. It’s time!
 As expected of the million-year-old mark. The system was not playing tricks this time!
 The third Dao Field was good. It could inherit everything in the main Dao Field and even teleport. When the main Dao Field was broken through, he could still escape to the third Dao Field.
 The third Dao Field couldn’t be left in the Heavenly Dao. He had to find a suitable hiding place in the Chaos. It was best if no one knew!
 Han Jue first took out the Creation Spirit Stone and fused it with one of the Fiendcelestial Qi.
 Who should he use the Heavenly Dao Spirit Stone on?
 The Heaven-Opening Axe was already an Ultimate Dao Treasure. Would Han Jue be able to control it if it was any stronger?
 Using it on the Book of Misfortune felt useless. Han Jue didn’t have a goal to curse it to death for the time being.
 As for the First Life Black Sovereign, he still had to be the Dark Forbidden Lord’s scapegoat.
 Forget it, I’ll keep it for now
 now.
 Han Jue took out the Great Dao Fragment. He had finally accumulated nine more.
 Han Jue had already thought of a new Great Dao Mystical Power.
 He wanted to create a Mystical Power that could kill enemies in dreams!
 At the peak of Buzhou Divine Mountain.
 Han Yu looked at the woman in green who had walked back from the lightning tribulation and sighed with emotion. “You’ve finally reached the Emperor Realm. Not bad. It’s earlier than I expected.”
 The green-robed woman came in front of him and knelt down. She bowed and said, “Thank you, Senior. If not for your nurturing, I would never have achieved what I have today.”
 Han Yu smiled.
 The woman in green gritted her teeth. “Senior, can I take revenge now?”
 Han Yu closed his eyes and said, “Your enemy just reached the Deity Realm not long ago.”
 The woman in green was as if struck by lightning. Her eyes widened and her body trembled.
 Leaves fluttered past. At this moment, the scene was desolate and pitiful.
 “Is the other party a prodigy?” the woman in green asked bitterly.
 Prodigies were the most dazzling existences in this era.
 There were countless geniuses. This was also a golden age.
 However, because it was the golden age of geniuses, all living beings were very tolerant of them. This was because geniuses represented hope and the backbone of the Heavenly Dao when it was in danger in the future. The various providence sects would take care of them.
 Han Yu said, “Yes, he has the potential to reach the Zenith Heaven Realm.”
 Despair appeared on the woman’s face.
 Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal…
 They were all ancestor-level existences on the path of cultivation!
 The woman in green was indignant. She stared at Han Yu with a hopeful expression and asked, “Senior, do I really have no hope of seeking revenge?”
 Han Yu said, “There’s not so much luck in the world. You being saved by me is already the greatest providence in your life. You’re originally someone who was fated to die. Sometimes, letting go is harder and also a greater achievement.”
 The woman in green lowered her head.
 Han Yu said slowly, “I once had the anger of revenge in my heart. My family, my parents, my siblings, and even my sweetheart died in front of me. At that moment, I hated the entire world. I hated the immortals, the heavens, and my own uselessness.”
 The woman in green looked up at him in a daze.
 Han Yu said, “Later, someone helped me take revenge.”
 The woman in green’s eyes lit up. Was Senior hinting at her?
 Han Yu changed the topic. “So what if revenge was taken? Look at me now. I’m alone and guarding this mountain. I have no one to rely on. If I don’t take revenge, my enemies won’t live for hundreds of thousands of years. What’s the point of my revenge?”
 The woman in green said stubbornly, “At least you’ve avenged yourself and have nothing to worry about. I’m unwilling to let my enemies live freely for hundreds of thousands of years.”
 Han Yu said helplessly, “To tell you the truth, that prodigy is backed by the Jie School. I don’t have to tell you about the Jie School’s foundation, do I?”
 Jie School…
 The woman in green immediately collapsed to the ground.
 She smiled bitterly and suddenly felt that all these years of cultivation were meaningless.
 However, he had no reason to do so.
 He didn’t owe this woman anything.
 Han Yu opened his eyes and said, “If you want revenge, then go down the mountain and seek the help of a stronger mighty figure. You might be able to succeed if you are lucky.”
  The woman in green stood up and took a deep breath. She bowed to Han Yu and left the mountain without hesitation.
 Han Yu closed his eyes and continued cultivating
 It was just an incident on the path of cultivation. He didn’t care about it at all.
 Several months later.
 The woman in green returned to the top of the mountain. She stared at Han Yu and said, “I walked all the way to the foot of Buzhou Divine Mountain and thought about many things. I will definitely die if I go to take revenge. I can die in battle for Master with no regrets, but I promised you that I would serve you. You have taught me for tens of thousands of years. I will owe you too much if I die like this.
 “I’m willing to serve you. I’ll take revenge when my lifespan is up. I can be considered to have avenged my dead master even if I die.” Han Yu did not reply.
 The woman in green walked to the side and sat in meditation at her original cultivation place.
 Buzhou Divine Mountain was still quiet. Only the wind stirred everything in the world.


 “What should I call it? Dream Killer? No, it’s pathetic,” Han Jue muttered to himself.
 After hesitating for a while, he named this Mystical Power the “Dark Forbidden Zone”!
 This Mystical Power did not only cause damage to the enemy in the dream. After all, it was a dream. Such damage could not hurt the main body. Therefore, he thought of the Great Sage Void Soul’s Dark Instinct and imitated its profundity to create the Dark Forbidden Zone.
 The Dark Forbidden Zone transformed the dream realm into a mysterious domain. It could pull both sides’ bodies into this mysterious domain for them to fight.
 The Dark Forbidden Zone couldn’t be spied on. In battle, as long as Han Jue could kill the other party, he was not afraid of being exposed!
 He was in a good mood and had another long-range killing method.
  In a good mood, he began to preach the Dao to the disciples of the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 With the help of his clone, Li Xuan’ao had sent many geniuses into the Hundred Peak Immortal River over the years. The number of disciples had already exceeded five million. In the past, the number could be controlled because Li Xuan’ao forbade his disciples from giving birth. Later, Li Xuan’ao often went out and Han Jue didn’t show himself. Many disciples couldn’t help but give birth to disciples. However, with the Hidden Punishment Lineage led by Zhou Mingyue, this phenomenon didn’t dare to expand. However, after so many years, the number of disciples still doubled.
 After preaching for a hundred years, Han Jue started to check his emails.
 [Your grand-disciple Chu Shiren obtained Great Dao merit because he preached the Dao to billions of living beings.]
 [Your good friend Evil Heavenly Emperor was cursed by a mysterious curse.]
 (Your disciple Ji Xianshen has attained the Dao and obtained the Primordial Chaos Dao Fruit.]
 [Your good friend Zhou Fan has traveled through time and changed his fate.]
 [Your good friend Mo Fuchou has revived.]
 [Your son Han Tuo was attacked by a mysterious demon] x50093272
 (Your good friend Jing Tiangong has received guidance from your good friend Ancestor Xitian. His cultivation has increased greatly.)
 Han Jue blinked. Zhou Fan had revived Mo Fuchou?
 How did he do that?
 If he had been revived in the past, Mo Fuchou should have been living in Han Jue’s memories.
 He checked his interpersonal relationships and saw that Mo Fuchou’s portrait had indeed appeared again.
 Interesting
 Han Jue saw Mo Fuchou and couldn’t help but reminisce.
 They were all youths back then.
 Han Jue continued reading. Jing Tiangong, who he had not been paying attention for a long time, started to be active again.
 This fellow had left the Divine Palace a long time ago to head to the Chaos. He didn’t expect him to still be cursing people. As expected of a loyal believer of the Dark Forbidden Lord.
 Why was Ancestor Xitian guiding him?
 Han Jue found it interesting, but only slightly.
 In any case, Jing Tiangong was his follower. His favorability had not decreased. Reading on, Han Jue saw another email.
 (Your enemy, the Curse Fiendcelestial, was killed by your good friend, the Divine Robe Daoist. His body and soul were destroyed. The Curse Great Dao returned to the Chaos.]
 The Curse Fiendcelestial was gone?
 Han Jue checked his interpersonal relationships and discovered that the portrait was really gone.
 He had a strange expression.
 In the past, he had treated the Curse Fiendcelestial as a big boss. He didn’t expect it to be gone just like that.
 Good, this will show how powerful I am.
 He didn’t need to personally attack to kill a potential enemy.
 The Curse Fiendcelestial’s death had a profound meaning, which meant that the restrictions of the Dark Forbidden Lord had decreased greatly.
 It had to be said that Daoist Divine Robe was a talent!
 Previously, he had left two backup plans when attacking the Heavenly Dao. He definitely valued his opponent greatly.
 This kind of person looked down on the enemy on the surface and deliberately created a stupid arrogant image, but he secretly prepared all sorts of methods to disgust the enemy. Having such a subordinate was good as he could handle responsibilities reliably.
 Han Jue’s favorability towards the Divine Robe Daoist increased.
 After reading all the emails, Han Jue recalled something
 He suddenly wanted to go out for a walk.
 He was absolutely invincible and was not afraid of danger in the Heavenly Dao.
 In any case, time was long. He would spend a hundred years wandering the Heavenly Dao and experience the current mortal world.
 Han Jue sent out a soul thought and transformed into a clone. He quickly flew to the Immortal World, and his main body continued cultivating. The image of the clone was the same as the main body. Although the Supreme Treasures were illusory, they were still impressive.
 Han Jue didn’t want to conceal himself.
 He had been cautious for too long. Why would he still pretend and hide within his own territory?
 The first stop was Buzhou Divine Mountain.
 He saw Han Yu’s situation in the emails. This kid was really similar to him. He had settled down in the long years and cultivated in peace.
 …
 On the peak of Buzhou Divine Mountain.
 Han Yu sat under the old tree and looked at the woman in green who was cleaning the Daoist temple. He said helplessly, “There’s no need to clean. I’m not staying inside. Keeping it is just me thinking about my master.”
 The woman in green could have cast a spell, but she felt that it was too frivolous, so she personally did it.
 Hearing Han Yu mention his master, the green-robed woman walked out of the Daoist temple and asked curiously, “Your master must be very powerful, right? Where did he go?”
 Han Yu’s eyes drifted as he said slowly, “I’m not sure, but he must be chasing his own Dao and will return one day.”
 “Your master is stronger than you?” the green-robed woman asked curiously. Han Yu’s bearing was the most stable and sage-like she had ever seen.
 Han Yu smiled. “Of course. I think my master is the strongest.”
 The strongest?
 The green-robed woman blinked and did not believe him. After all, the Heavenly Dao was extremely vast and there were many geniuses. No one could say how many ancient mighty figures were hidden, let alone the legends of Sages.
 “Oh? Your master is the strongest? Then what am I?”
 A voice floated over. Han Yu and the woman in green turned around.
 It was Han Jue.
 Both of them were stunned.
  Han Jue wore the Time Dao Robe and the Grand Primordium Divine Crown. He was mighty and domineering. Three thousand Heavenly Dragons wrapped around his waist and dragon shadows swayed behind him. It was dazzling. The Ultimate Diamond Bracelet on his wrists burned with flames. The World Visualization Heart Bracelet surrounded him and changed into various forms. In addition to his unparalleled appearance, even Han Yu was stunned.
 She carefully sized up Han Jue and suddenly felt that he and Han Yu were extremely similar, like brothers.
 Han Yu noticed her gaze and shouted in a low voice, “Impudent! Get down the mountain and cultivate. You are not allowed to go up the mountain without my orders!”
 The woman in green was shocked. This was the first time Han Yu had revealed a ferocious expression. She was so frightened that she hurriedly bowed to Han Jue and flew down the mountain.
 Han Jue landed in front of Han Yu and smiled. “Why are you so angry? Who is she to you?”
 Han Yu suppressed his nervousness and replied, “She’s considered half a disciple.”


 Speaking of which, the two of them had actually only met a few times, most of them in his dreams.
 Han Yu knew this ancestor’s identity and was very restrained.
 They were related by blood, but they were too far apart and the two of them had never been together. It was very difficult for Han Yu to be close to Han Jue.
 Han Jue listened to Han Yu patiently and with relish.
 It had to be said that although Han Yu often cultivated diligently, his previous experience in the Chaos was even richer than Han Jue’s entire life.
 Han Yu finally finished after a few days.
  “There’s really nothing else. I’ve finished explaining,” Han Yu said aggrievedly.
 Han Jue smiled. “Not bad, not bad. It’s very interesting. I find it very interesting.”
 Han Yu was helpless. Was this ancestor here to listen to a story?
 Won’t everything in the world enter your eyes if you calculate with your fingers?
 In fact, he was still very happy.
 The fact that Han Jue looked for him meant that he still cared about him. He was flattered.
 The ancestor in front of him was an extraordinary existence that even Sages might not see.
 Han Yu was excited and hurriedly kowtowed.
 Han Yu nodded excitedly. He was also a little confused earlier and didn’t know if he had chosen the right path. He was full of confidence now that he had received Han Jue’s praise.
 Han Jue stood up and took out the Heavenly Origin Bracelet. This was a Heavenly Dao Numinous Treasure and also a defensive Dharma treasure.
 “This is the Heavenly Origin Bracelet, a Heavenly Dao Numinous Treasure. Consider it a greeting gift.”
 Han Yu took it, flattered.
 He subconsciously wanted to reject it, but thinking of how Han Jue was an elder, wouldn’t he embarrass him if he rejected it?
 Although Han Jue was friendly to him, he had heard of this ancestor’s terrifying legends.
 Among the Sages, Han Jue was definitely the most ruthless.
 “By the way, Han Tuo didn’t save you back then. It’s not that he has a heart of stone. It’s just that he was suppressed in the netherworld at that time and endured pain that you can’t imagine. He was actually like you, walking alone in the world. He left me before he was twenty and didn’t know my true identity until he followed the Evil Heavenly Emperor,” Han Jue said meaningfully.
 Han Jue didn’t say anything else and left.
 “Ancestor, where are you going?”
 “To travel the Immortal World and see the heavens.”
 “I…”
 “Cultivate well. Do I still need your protection?”
 Han Jue’s laughter gradually faded away. Han Yu sighed.
 This was what attaining the Dao meant.
 He could do as he pleased and roam the world.
 On the other side.
 Han Jue walked down the Buzhou Divine Mountain, wanting to experience its majesty. Speaking of which, he had given this mountain to Li Daokong.
 Along the way, he met the woman in green. She was meditating on the hill.
 Han Jue’s aura was ethereal and the woman in green didn’t notice it.
 Looking at her, Han Jue had a thought as he waved his right hand gently and a beam of light quickly surged into the woman’s mind.
 Han Yu had been alone ever since Qin Ling left. He finally had half a disciple. Han Jue felt that he should take care of her.
 That was all.
 The woman in green slowly opened her eyes after an unknown period of time.
 For some reason, she suddenly felt that the world had changed.
 To be precise, her senses had transformed.
 She was even more sensitive to Connate Qi, Spirit Qi, and the essence of the sun and moon.
 “What’s happening?”
 The woman in green frowned and muttered to herself.
 As for Han Jue, he had already left.
 At this moment, Han Yu’s voice floated down, “Come up.”
 The woman in green’s eyes lit up. She immediately went up the mountain and quickly bowed.
 Han Yu naturally saw Han Jue wave at him. Ever since then, the woman in green had fallen into a state of enlightenment. It was obvious that this girl had obtained a huge opportunity.
 Ancestor, did you misunderstand my relationship with her?
Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n)) The woman in green said excitedly, “You can tell? I suddenly feel that everything is different.”
 The woman in green nodded as if she understood.
 She asked curiously, “Where’s that senior? He’s already left? Who is he, your elder brother?”
 Han Yu glared at her and scolded her. “Don’t talk nonsense. He’s my ancestor. Forget about this in the future and don’t mention it to anyone.”
 Ancestor?
 The woman in green clicked her tongue in wonder. Although there was a way to stay youthful in the world, Han Jue didn’t feel old to her.
 No wonder Senior was so panicked when facing him.
 “Senior, is he very strong? Even stronger than your master?” the woman in green asked curiously.
 The woman in green frowned and thought carefully about his words.
 After leaving Buzhou Divine Mountain, Han Jue walked on foot without stopping.
 The mountains and rivers were majestic, with various lakes and valleys. All sorts of magnificent scenery floated past his eyes. During this time, he also encountered many cultivators, but seeing that his aura was extraordinary, they did not dare to approach him.
 Han Jue recalled the past as he traveled.
 Not long ago, this world was an existence he respected. He didn’t even dare to step foot in
 it.
 Year after year passed. On this day, Han Jue came to a rugged mountain path that wound around the peaks. Halfway up the mountain, a group of wooden houses that looked like villages could be seen.
 Han Jue heard the sound of children playing.
 A seven- or eight-year-old child rode a big white wolf out of the bushes beside him and jumped into the forest a thousand feet away.
 Han Jue narrowed his eyes.
  Eh?
 He saw a wisp of purple Qi on the child.
 This purple aura was very faint, but it was very mysterious.
 It wasn’t the Primordial Purple Qi or the Great Dao Purple Qi. It was more like providence.
 Han Jue pinched his fingers to deduce and was enlightened.
 A future Sage!
 Over the years, Han Jue had seen countless people. The only person who attracted his attention was the child just now.
 Now, the providence of a Sage could no longer trigger the system’s Connate providence detection. However, Han Jue was a Great Dao Sage and could spy on the fate of mortals.


 With the current development of the Heavenly Dao, the future Heavenly Dao Sages would definitely not be a small number.
 Han Jue continued forward and quickly left the forest.
 In the forest.
 The child rolled off the wolf’s back. He turned around and for some reason, he felt lost, as if he had missed something.
 The young him didn’t understand this emotion. He turned around and forgot about it. He was attracted by a wild rabbit in the forest.
 Ten years later.
  Han Jue came near the Holy Mother Sect. He stood on the cliff and faced the wind with a graceful bearing.
 Looking up, he saw countless jade buildings on the rolling mountains ahead. Female cultivators cultivated in all directions. Some meditated in the forest, and some fought in the sky. All of them were filled with Immortal Qi, like female immortals flying in the sky.
 “It’s developing well.”
 Han Jue praised. Although Li Yao, Dao Comprehension Sword, and Tu Ling’er had already abdicated, the Holy Mother Sect was still in the hands of their disciples. It was still a branch of the Hidden Sect.
 At this moment, a group of female disciples passed by on a cloud. One of the yellow-robed women glared at Han Jue and shouted, “This is the territory of the Holy Mother Sect. Men are not allowed to approach!”
 The other female disciples stared at Han Jue, attracted by his handsomeness.
 They were in seclusion in the sect all year round and had seen very few men. Even if they had gone out to train, they had never seen a handsome man like him. Immediately, many female disciples fell in love with Han Jue at first sight.
 Han Jue smiled and left.
 “Wait, can you leave your Dao title? We can report it if the seniors of the sect invite you,” asked a white-robed woman. She was beautiful and had a heroic aura between her brows. Her looks were considered top-notch among the female disciples.
 Han Jue waved his hand and said, “I was just passing by.”
 He wasn’t interested in these fairies.
 The joy of men and women could no longer affect Han Jue’s thoughts. In his eyes, peerless beauties were no different from ordinary women.
 After Han Jue left, the female disciples couldn’t help but discuss.
 “It’s all Junior Li’s fault. Why did you chase him away?”
 “So handsome. What should I do? I think I like him.”
 “From his attire, he’s probably not an ordinary cultivator. Don’t cause trouble.”
 “Our Holy Mother Sect is not an ordinary sect, either. He stopped us the moment we said that. This means that this person is not rude or unreasonable. Sigh, he just left too decisively.”
 “Yes, male cultivators would be glib-tongued when they passed by the Holy Mother Sect in the past. Very few men see us so calmly.”
 The woman in white listened to her fellow disciples and couldn’t help but look at Han Jue’s back.
 Who was he?
 A series of favorability notifications appeared in front of Han Jue. He ignored them all.
 Over the years, most of the women he met had a good impression of him. Even some men fell in love with him at first sight.
 He knew his limits. Others did not like him as a person, but his face.
 The favorability of meeting once was always weak and easily erased by time.
  It was just lust.
 When Han Jue walked through the world, outside the 33rd Heaven, in the Pangu Hall.
 Pan Xin, Jin Shen, Emperor Xiao, Xu Dudao, and Ji Xianshen gathered here.
 The Sages had their own circles, and Pan Xin’s circle had two more Sages.
 Although the Sages listened to Han Jue, it didn’t stop them from forming small circles. Just like the Hidden Sect, they also had different benefits and differences. Even the personal disciples had small circles.
 Pan Xin cursed, “Damn it, I’m prepared to fight them to the death!”
 Xu Dudao said worriedly, “Didn’t Senior Han say not to fight with Life for the time being?”
 Pan Xin smiled. “Even if there’s no conflict, we can still fight to the death. Recently, we’ve been wantonly capturing mighty figures who escaped from the Ancient Desolate. We can disrupt the situation.”
 Jin Shen said, “Actually, we can also rope in those mighty figures to join the Heavenly Dao, just like how Fellow Daoist Han roped in Great Sage Void Soul.”
 Great Sage Void Soul was a Great Dao Sage. In addition to Han Jue, two Great Dao Sages protected the Heavenly Dao. He wasn’t afraid even if the new Great Dao Sage had the intention to rebel.
 Ji Xianshen said, “Doesn’t that mean that we’re going to the Chaos?”
 He had never been to the Chaos, so he was a little nervous.
 Xu Dudao asked, “Aren’t cultivators below the Sages cannon fodder?”
 Pan Xin glanced at him and said, “You only gain when you lose. Once you succeed, not only can you restrain fate, but you can also strengthen the Heavenly Dao.” Emperor Xiao said, “This is indeed a great contribution. Fellow Daoist Han only said that we can’t rashly start a conflict and didn’t say that he wanted to give up against Life.”
 Xu Dudao frowned and did not refute in the end.
 Sages schemed and all living beings were pawns.
 As long as the Heavenly Dao was good, the sacrifice in front of him was nothing.
 Pan Xin continued to explain some details. The four Sages listened carefully.
 On the other side.
 In the Universal Hall.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du, Sect Master Tian Jue, South Extreme Heavenly Venerate, Qiu Xilai, Fang Liang, and Heavenly Venerate Wufa were also discussing something.
 “An alliance between a hundred worlds is not a small matter. Unlike the previous banquet, we’re going all out this time. At that time, the Divine Robe Daoist will also be here. I wonder if he will target the Heavenly Dao,” Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said in a low voice.
 Heavenly Venerate Wufa said, “The Divine Robe Daoist shouldn’t be targeting the Heavenly Dao. He might even support it.”
 Sect Master Tian Jue, Fang Liang, and Qiu Xilai nodded.
  The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate stared at the four of them, his eyelids twitching.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du seemed to have thought of something. His gaze changed slightly as he said, “In that case, the five of us will go. The other Sages will guard the Heavenly Dao.”
 The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate asked, “Aren’t we going to discuss this with the other Sages?”
 The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate looked at him deeply and cursed silently. The old fox was finally going to tear off his hypocritical mask and start fighting for power.
 In the past hundreds of thousands of years, Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du had no desires and gradually gained power. Now, if he wanted to fight for something, the other Sages could not reject him.
 “This matter is settled. All of you can choose a batch of geniuses. The stronger their potential, the better. It’s just nice to show the Heavenly Dao’s power to the other worlds,” Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du instructed with an unquestionable tone.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du was filled with confidence after obtaining Heavenly Venerate Wufa’s confirmation.


 Han Jue stood on the beach. The waves slapped over like strings of white flowers. There was no end to them.
 The sky here was so blue and short.
 The slightly salty sea breeze blew over, causing Han Jue’s long hair to flutter slightly. He narrowed his eyes. He was really relaxed.
 He had also encountered many evil things.
 But really, the Heavenly Dao was in a peaceful situation. How could there be an absolutely peaceful world?
 If he saved one person today and this person avoided this calamity, there might be an even greater calamity waiting for him.
 even
 Of course, this was a different situation.
 When the difference in the cultivation realm was not great, if there was kindness and justice, they should act and accumulate merit for themselves. They would constantly grow and save more people.
 Han Jue was not unkind, but he was already above the rules of the world. Intervening would only break the order.
 Mortals wouldn’t stand up for ants in the courtyard.
 He felt that he was the main reason why the Heavenly Dao could be where it was today.
 Perhaps he didn’t build the Heavenly Dao, but even Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du had to ask him about its development direction.
 If not for him, the Heavenly Dao would have been destroyed countless times over.
 Han Jue walked along the sea aimlessly.
 Rows of birds flew past the sky.
 Boom
 The sea suddenly exploded as a black fish the size of a mountain leaped out, covering the sky. A figure stood above it. It was a blue-robed man holding a sword.
 “Hahaha. Evil beast, you’re still far from being able to eat me!”
 The blue-robed man smiled in high spirits. He turned around and slashed with his sword. Sword Qi swept out and blood splattered. The black fish’s head was chopped into two. It did not leave its body and actually roared like a tiger or lion.
 The black fish fell into the sea, stirring up thousands of feet of waves.
 The seawater evaporated when it was about to land on Han Jue.
 Han Jue glanced at it and sighed. “I’ve never experienced such a soul-stirring adventure. I’m really envious.”
 The blue-robed man leaped and landed in front of him, putting the sword back into the sheath.
 He patted his robe and said with a smile, “Brother, you’re good. I can’t sense your aura.”
 Han Jue said, “Since you can’t sense it, how dare you block the way?’
 The blue-robed man smiled. “Isn’t traveling the world to make good friends? I’m Gu Heng. May I know your name?”
 Han Jue smiled faintly. “I can’t let you know my name. Otherwise, you will suffer great karma.”
 Gu Heng was stunned.
 What a pretentious prick!
 He had always thought that he was good at pretending. He didn’t expect to meet someone even more pretentious.
 Gu Heng smiled. “Oh? Is that so? Brother, let me try and see if I can withstand the great karma.”
 Han Jue suddenly raised his hand and pressed his shoulder.
 So fast!
 Gu Heng’s pupils dilated in shock.
 His gaze met Han Jue’s eyes and a terrifying pressure enveloped his heart. He was so frightened that he knelt in front of him.
 Han Jue smiled and brushed past him.
 He was a Great Dao Sage, after all. Why was he calculative with mortals?
 In a few steps, Han Jue disappeared at the end of the coastline.
 After a long while…
 Gu Heng came back to his senses and stood up trembling
 He looked in the direction Han Jue left in fear and muttered to himself, “Who is he… I’m at the f*cking Six Mystic Divine Origin!”
 He liked to pretend to be weak. Previously, he had suppressed his aura to the cultivation of a Grand Unity True Immortal and traveled the world, playing with the mortal world.
 It was too ridiculous to make a Six Mystic Divine Origin expert directly kneel on the ground!
 Gu Heng had been to the Sage Dao Field!
 He was puzzled.
 Who was that person just now?
 He recalled carefully and was horrified to find that he could no longer remember the other party’s appearance.
 In a temple.
 Han Jue sat in front of the small table and drank tea. Opposite him knelt a white-robed monk. It was the White-Robed Buddha who had submitted to him a long time ago, the Reroll World’s current master.
 The White-Robed Buddha was very excited about Han Jue’s arrival.
 He thought that Han Jue had already forgotten about him, but he was not dissatisfied. After all, with the karma between the Reroll World and Han Jue, the Sages took good care of him.
 Han Jue smiled and said, “The Reroll World has developed well. There are ten Zenith Heaven Golden Immortals.”
 The White-Robed Buddha suppressed his excitement and said respectfully, “It’s all thanks to your nurturing.”
 Not only was the current Reroll World developed and prosperous, but it was also vast. It could be considered the genuine second mortal world.
 The Jade Pure Sacred Sect was still around and was already the oldest Holy Land with a deep foundation. The previous Holy Land, the Heavenly Immortal Manor, had perished in the war between the righteous and demonic cultivators hundreds of thousands of years ago. Originally, the Jade Pure Sacred Sect was also about to perish. Fortunately, the White-Robed Buddha protected it.
 The White-Robed Buddha knew very well the Jade Pure Sacred Sect’s importance. Perhaps Han Jue no longer cared about it, but seeing it would definitely trigger memories. It was enough as long as he had memories.
 This was the difference between the Reroll World and the other mortal worlds.
 The White-Robed Buddha seemed to have thought of something and said, “By the way, your Sect Master Li Qingzi reincarnated back then. He’s now a prodigy of the Jade Pure Sacred Sect.”
 Han Jue looked at him deeply, causing him to lower his head.
 Crap!
 I was too deliberate!
 The White-Robed Buddha secretly regretted it. He was too anxious. Han Jue should have accidentally discovered this before it was effective. How could he say it himself?
 “Thank you for your kind intentions. Let nature take its course. I won’t forget your efforts.”
 Han Jue picked up his teacup and drank it in one gulp.
 Li Qingzi was already an old friend of the previous calamity. How long had it been since the reincarnation? Furthermore, some ghosts had died in the Dao Destruction Mystical Power. The reason why Li Qingzi could avoid it was probably that someone protected him and prevented him from reincarnating in the calamity.
 The White-Robed Buddha was pleasantly surprised and hurriedly said that he did not deserve it.
  Han Jue stayed in the temple for a few months before leaving. During this time, he even taught the White-Robed Buddha a Mystical Power.
 In a valley.
 A man in cloth clothes was practicing his sword in a bamboo forest. He was only practicing his sword techniques. His Dharmic powers were not leaked or even stirred up any waves.
 “How about I teach you a sword technique?”
 A voice floated over. The man turned around and saw an extremely handsome man appear not far away, smiling at him.
 The man asked warily, “Who are you? Why haven’t I seen you in the Jade Pure Sacred Sect?”
 The man frowned and said in a low voice, “No!”
