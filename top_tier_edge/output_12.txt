

He looked at the South Extreme Heavenly Venerate. The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate immediately said, “I’ve already cut ties with the Heavenly Lord of Primordial Beginning. If the Heavenly Dao loses, I definitely won’t survive. Don’t worry, I’ll definitely support you with all my might.” He was surprised. Why didn’t Sect Master Tian Jue target the other Sages first? Weren’t they close friends? Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du added, “We’re already united. Don’t worry about each other. I suggest that the Heavenly Dao Sect head to the netherworld first. Chan School, Jie School, Human School, and Hidden Sect will guard the Immortal World and the heavens first. I suspect that the Calamity Race is only the first step. Those existences are plotting. How can we be their match? They won’t put all their pawns on the table immediately.” The Sages nodded.

Nüwa’s escape was enough to make them not dare to underestimate her. Fang Liang had no objections. “I’ll arrange it immediately.”

He then sent a voice transmission to the Divine General telling him to mobilize the Heavenly Dao Sect disciples.

Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du looked at Emperor Xiao and asked, “How’s the takeover of the Devil Race?”

Emperor Xiao replied, “They’re already on a scale and can enter the war at any time. This netherworld defense battle can test them.”

The devils were scattered in the Heavenly Dao, the Little Heavenly Dao, the depths of the Chaos, and so on. They were virtually the most widely distributed race. Even in the Ancient Desolate, they suppressed the Devil Ancestor and the Primordial Devil Race.


Among the Sages, other than Li Daokong and Shi Dudao, they already had their own forces. Even Heavenly Venerate Wufa’s Wufa Sect was very large in scale and not much inferior to the other Sage Sects. Han Jue listened to Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du’s arrangements and didn’t interrupt. Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du clearly took care of the Hidden Sect. The other Sages didn’t dare to have any objections. After all, the Hidden Sect didn’t enjoy the providence of the Heavenly Dao and Han Jue had repeatedly protected the Heavenly Dao. He should give them face. Moreover, half of the current Sages were Han Jue’s spies.

Heavenly Venerate Wufa, Qiu Xilai, and Sect Master Tian Jue had already been enslaved by the Primordial Heavenly Prison. Fang Liang and Li Daokong had also left the Hidden Sect, and Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du had a personal relationship with Han Jue. Only Shi Dudao, the South Extreme Heavenly Venerate, and Emperor Xiao were left. Shi Dudao was Han Jue’s spy as well. The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate was a close friend of Sect Master Tian Jue.

In other words, the only person who could refute Han Jue now was Emperor Xiao. It was difficult to do anything alone. It had to be said that this feeling was quite good. After discussing the battle plan, the Sages dispersed. Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du stopped Han Jue. “Fellow Daoist Han, you have to help if we encounter a Freedom Sage this time. After all, the ancestor is not here,” he said meaningfully. Han Jue asked, “Will a Great Dao Sage participate in this attack?”

“No, my master said that all the Great Dao Sages in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End will go to the Ancient Desolate to suppress it. This is a consensus. No Great Dao Sage will dare to be absent.”

Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du’s words caused Han Jue to sigh.


Han Jue said, “I’ll deal with them if I can. If I can’t, I’ll stay in the Heavenly Dao. At most, I’ll waste their time and wait for the ancestor to return.”

Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said meaningfully, “Your Dao Field is in the Heavenly Dao. How did you let yourself be in the Heavenly Dao? Can you also attack in the Heavenly Dao?” “Hehe, you’re thinking too much. If that was really the case, I would have long destroyed the Flame Race. I only used a secret technique to carve out a space in the Heavenly Dao and borrow its protection. I can’t walk the Immortal World with my true body.” Han Jue didn’t fall for it. This fellow wanted to force him to work hard.

Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “That’s true. After all, even the Dao Ancestor can’t move in the Immortal World.”

The two of them chatted for a while more before Han Jue left. Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du stared in the direction Han Jue left, his eyes flickering. 

After returning to the Daoist temple, Han Jue began to deduce the future. “In this calamity, who is the strongest enemy the Heavenly Dao faces?” Han Jue asked in his mind. (100 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?) Continue! [Divine Lord Peacock: Perfected Freedom Sage, Immeasurable Emperor, Demon Saint, Great Dao Mystical Power Inheritor] He was indeed a perfected Freedom Sage! Han Jue was not afraid. He was now at the mid-stage of the Freedom Primordial Chaos Realm and was confident in defeating someone in the perfected realm. However, the prerequisite for him to make a move was that he could insta-kill Divine Lord Peacock. Otherwise, it would be too dangerous.

Han Jue didn’t believe that all the Great Dao Sages were focused on dealing with the Ancient Desolate. Even if they sent a clone, it was still extremely dangerous for him.

Continue cultivating!

Han Jue closed his eyes and strove to reach the late stage of the Freedom Primordial Chaos Realm as soon as possible. In the later stages, he wouldn’t be far from perfection.


In that case, he would break through soon.

In the Dark Forbidden Zone, boundless mist filled the air.

Countless living beings were hidden in the mist. Their postures were different. All of them were ugly, like ancient ferocious beasts.

Nine huge beasts that looked like ferocious tigers were wrapped in chains. At the other end of the chains was a huge and majestic city. It was black and sinister like a turtle shell. On the city’s highest building stood dozens of transformed figures.

The leader was a woman dressed in black armor and a dragon bone crown. Her facial features were handsome, but her left face was covered in black scales, making her look sinister. The black-armored woman stared ahead and asked, “When will the Divine Lord arrive?”

A black-robed man beside him said in a low voice, “He’s already on the way. He’s tied down by the Heavenly Court of the Dark Forbidden Zone. He’ll probably take some time.” The black-armored woman frowned.

At this moment, a ball of black smoke appeared beside her. A figure came out from it. “Patriarch, he has already reincarnated into the Six Paths of Reincarnation. He can attack at any time.” The woman in black armor fell into deep thought. After a long while… “Activate the Yin-Yang array formation and open the barrier tunnel to the Heavenly Dao’s netherworld. Once it’s opened, the entire race will rush in and occupy the netherworld as soon as possible. Without my orders, you are not allowed to invade the world of the living!” the woman in black armor ordered.

The mighty figures of the Calamity Race behind her agreed in unison.

Soon, the roars of ferocious beasts sounded in the boundless mist, as if the horn of war had sounded.

Netherworld. At the end of the Yellow Spring, countless immortals and ghosts stood on both sides of the Yellow Spring and floated in the air. Shining with divine light, the Heavenly God General suddenly frowned. He saw fluctuations in the darkness at the end of the Yellow Spring. It was space.

Boom!

Space shattered, and a terrifying red pillar of light stirred up waves in the Yellow Spring and rushed into the depths of the netherworld. The Heavenly God General immediately attacked, using his powerful body to block the red pillar of light. A terrifying aura overflowed from the spatial hole. The first to charge was a ten-thousand-foot-tall terrifying giant. It seemed to be made of meat, and it had a terrifying aura.
 Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal!
 Their momentum was huge, even stronger than the previous Flame Race. However, this time, the Heavenly Dao was long prepared. The cultivators of the Heavenly Race, the Heavenly Dao Sect, and the netherworld entered the war. The news quickly spread to the Immortal World. The mighty figures ranked ahead of the Providence Board rushed to the netherworld’s nine springs. Not all the mighty figures in the Immortal World belonged to Sage Sects.
 Most of them had their own factions and ambitions. In the previous battle with the Flame Race, all the living beings who had participated and survived had obtained merit. This made the mighty figures concerned. It was not only to protect the Heavenly Dao but also to fight for merit. “After the Flame Race, another race attacked from the Chaos. It’s called the Calamity Race.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du’s voice resounded through the myriad worlds, causing an uproar. To Sages, this calamity came quickly. However, to all living beings, the calamity of the Flame Race was already a legend. It was extremely ancient. However, Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du’s words were filled with bewitchment, painting a magnificent scene of an epic era for all living beings. Han Jue sighed. Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du was indeed capable of fooling people.
 He didn’t mind it and continued cultivating. This thousand-year seclusion was only halfway done. He had to continue. If the sky collapsed, the Sages would hold it up. He had no need to worry.
 He didn’t want to be a nanny.
 Time passed quickly.
 Soon, a thousand years passed.
 The Sage Sects were still constantly sending disciples to attack the netherworld. During the calamity, countless geniuses also appeared. Han Jue saw that Empress Houtu, Su Qi, Yang Tiandong, and the other leaders of the netherworld were all imprisoned.
 Han Jue couldn’t figure it out and couldn’t be bothered to use the derivation function to ask.
 He discovered that in just a few hundred years, dozens of Zenith Heaven Golden Immortals and a Pseudo-Sage had appeared in the Heavenly Dao. However, the cycle of reincarnation was controlled, causing the Heavenly Dao to be filled with wandering ghosts. Han Jue said, “Come in.” Outside the Daoist temple, Li Xuan’ao had been waiting for several years.
 He entered and knelt down to Han Jue. “Sect Master, the battle in the netherworld has been going on for hundreds of years. The Heavenly Dao is weak. Should the Hidden Sect make a move?” Li Xuan’ao asked.
 He felt that this was a good opportunity. Most of the disciples in the Hidden Sect had already reached their limits. They couldn’t improve by cultivating alone. The Heavenly Dao merit could allow them to advance to another level.
 Han Jue smiled. “Not yet.” The Calamity Race was different from the Flame Race. They were even stronger. Han Jue didn’t want the Hidden Sect to sacrifice themselves in vain.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du wasn’t in a hurry, so why would Han Jue be in a hurry?
 Han Jue didn’t reply. Dao Sovereign was uneasy. Han Jue silently deduced. So the reason why Li Xuan’ao came to propose was that Dao Sovereign begged him.
 How cunning!
 Han Jue was even more satisfied with Li Xuan’ao. Even if his suggestion was rejected, he didn’t sell Dao Sovereign to save his image.
 Han Jue said, “Dao Sovereign, do you know who I value the most?’”
 Dao Sovereign’s blood boiled when he heard that, and he immediately promised. That day, Dao Sovereign left the Hundred Peak Immortal River and headed to the netherworld to participate in the battle. The reason why he released Dao Sovereign was first, to let him break through, and second, to give Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du an explanation, proving that the Hidden Sect wasn’t just watching the show.
 Han Jue’s gaze landed outside the netherworld. Divine Lord Peacock’s aura was indeed very strong, so powerful that he wasn’t confident in insta-killing him.
 In that case…
 He could only do what he could as a world savior! Han Jue took out the Book of Misfortune and started cursing Divine Lord Peacock. After a while, Han Jue opened his eyes and frowned. What happened? He couldn’t curse Divine Lord Peacock! Han Jue tried a few more times and the curse failed.
 Something was wrong! “I want to know why I can’t curse Divine Lord Peacock?” Han Jue used the derivation function. (200 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?] So expensive!
 Could the existence be stronger than Ancestor Xitian?
 Continue!
 A line of words appeared in front of Han Jue.
 [Karma Bead: Great Dao Supreme Treasure. It can isolate all karma. It is formed by the soul of a Chaotic Fiendcelestial.]


 Great Dao Supreme Treasure! Han Jue was enlightened. No wonder the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End still dared to invade the Heavenly Dao after the Dark Forbidden Lord attacked!
 So he was prepared! Even the Chaotic Deity or Cundi didn’t have such a Supreme Treasure. How could Divine Lord Peacock obtain it? Does this fellow have a stronger backing? Han Jue continued to derive. (160 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?) Continue!
 [Heavenly Lord of Primordial Beginning: Great Dao Sage, Immeasurable Emperor, founder of the Chan School. Because you stopped the Dark Sage King from destroying the Heavenly Dao, he has developed hatred towards you. Current Hatred Points: 2 stars] It was him! Han Jue frowned and was still very puzzled. The Karma Bead was even more valuable than the Heavenly Lord of Primordial Beginning. Would he be willing to give this treasure to the Divine Lord Peacock?
 The Karma Bead was probably Divine Lord Peacock’s Dharma treasure.
 To be able to control such a Dharma treasure and not be fought over by the Great Dao Sages, Divine Lord Peacock was a talent.
 Han Jue wanted to test him. He directly used the Dark Nightmare and faced Divine Lord Peacock in the image of the Dark Forbidden Lord. The dream was above the Yellow Spring. The two of them floated in the air. Divine Lord Peacock wore a gorgeous embroidered robe and a seven-colored feather wind. He had a handsome face, and his crown was embedded with the head of a peacock. He was handsome and domineering. Especially his eyes, they were very sharp and cold.
 He stared at Han Jue and asked, “Who are you? What a Mystical Power. You actually pulled me into the dream directly and I didn’t sense anything.” Han Jue asked, “You’re also impressive. You have a Supreme Treasure that can block curses.” Divine Lord Peacock narrowed his eyes and exclaimed, “Dark Forbidden Lord!”
 Han Jue didn’t deny it. He wanted to show his cards.
 He had read Divine Lord Peacock’s information and did not know the word Chan School. In addition, he had a Supreme Treasure that even the Heavenly Lord of Primordial Beginning did not have. He might have only been invited.
 “I’m very interested in you. You can even curse the Chaotic Deity to death. Your appearance has broken the long-standing stability of the Chaos. Come out and fight me!” Divine Lord Peacock said with a burning gaze. Han Jue teased, “Are you the Chaotic Deity’s match?”
 “Yes, he lost.”
 “Then, how dare you challenge me?” “I like to challenge experts!” Divine Lord Peacock’s eyes burned as his powerful aura erupted, causing the dream to twist violently. Han Jue asked, “Why are you working for the Heavenly Lord of Primordial Beginning?” Divine Lord Peacock said, “I’m not working for him. I’m only here to add insult to injury to the Heavenly Dao.” To add insult to injury? Han Jue didn’t expect him to confess so easily. Divine Lord Peacock smiled mockingly and said, “The living beings of the Chaos are all from the Heavenly Dao. I’m the same.
 However, after the Dao Ancestor attained the Dao, he ruled over the Heavenly Dao and Sage positions alone. All the Sages were his disciples. The Sages in the future are also inheritors of the Dao Sect. Even if all living beings have outstanding potential and monstrous providence, they are still suppressed by the Dao Ancestor.
 “After the Dao Ancestor fused with the Dao, he became equivalent to the Heavenly Dao. He used the Heavenly Dao Immeasurable Calamity to expel us Pseudo-Sages from the Heavenly Dao and we struggled to survive in the Chaos. He controlled the Heavenly Dao like this and made it impossible for it to escape the Dao Sect’s hands. As time passed, the Sages became dissatisfied. “Although we are grateful for his teaching, there’s no need for us to serve him forever, right?
 Han Jue couldn’t stand this gaze. This fellow was too confident!
 Divine Lord Peacock’s words allowed Han Jue to understand the Dao Ancestor from another perspective.
 It had to be said that the Dao Ancestor was indeed a little domineering.
 If Han Jue was one of those Sages and was forever inferior to the Dao Ancestor, he wouldn’t be able to take it.
 Han Jue thought of the Hidden Sect. The Dao Ancestor’s betrayal was worth being wary of. Fortunately, the Hidden Sect did not have any territory or benefits for the disciples to fight for. Compared to the Dao Ancestor, Han Jue’s desire for power was very low. He rarely let his disciples help him and wouldn’t restrict their development.
 “The difference in cultivation level between us is too great. You can’t be my match. You’re not even worth me showing my face.”
 “In that case, why did you visit me in my dreams?” Divine Lord Peacock mocked.
 Han Jue asked, “What are you pursuing?” He had a Great Dao Purple Qi in his hand and could even transform a person into a Chaotic Fiendcelestial. This was his topic of conversation. Divine Lord Peacock smiled. “You want to subdue
 me?”
 “Is it impossible?” “There are many people who want to subdue me. Back then, the Dao Ancestor also wanted to take me in, but I rejected him. It’s precisely because of this that I’ll never have the chance to attain the Great Dao.”
 “What if I can let you attain the Great Dao?”
 While Divine Lord Peacock was still mocking, his words stunned him. Han Jue wasn’t in a hurry and waited patiently.
 He couldn’t help but check Divine Lord Peacock’s information again.
 [Divine Lord Peacock: Perfected Freedom Sage, Immeasurable Emperor, Demon Saint, Great Dao Mystical Power Inheritor] Great Dao Mystical Power Inheritor! Could he be the Kong Xuan of the Investiture of the Gods?
 Is this Mystical Power the Five-Colored Divine Light? In the Investiture of the Gods, Kong Xuan’s Five-Colored Divine Light could even defeat Sages. “Hmph, defeat me first. I can prove my potential to you!”
 The surrounding dream shattered like a mirror. He forcefully broke through the dream realm! In the Daoist temple, Han Jue opened his eyes. [Divine Lord Peacock has a favorable impression of you. Current favorability: 3 stars] Han Jue originally thought that Divine Lord Peacock was angry, but he didn’t expect him to have a favorable impression of him.
 Was this arrogance?
 Han Jue didn’t immediately go out to challenge Divine Lord Peacock. That would expose his relationship with the Dark Forbidden Lord.
 Dark Forbidden Zone.
 Han Tuo and Yi Tian quickly traveled with tens of thousands of Heavenly Court immortals. Their current selves had already been reborn. The spirit of an expert could be seen with the naked eye.
 They wore armor and their capes fluttered, looking majestic. Han Tuo’s eyes sharpened as he said, “We’re getting closer and closer to the Heavenly Dao. Prepare for battle at any time! “Kill them whenever you see them!”
 The tens of thousands of Heavenly Court immortals acknowledged softly. These immortals were all recruited by the Evil Heavenly Emperor from the various Little Heavenly Dao. Their cultivation levels were at least Grand Unity True Immortal, and they had extremely strong foundations. Han Tuo and Yi Tian were even experts who dominated the Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm.
 Yi Tian suddenly smiled and said, “It’s been a long time since we returned to the Heavenly Dao. If we succeed, shouldn’t the Heavenly Dao Sages thank?us?”


 Han Tuo frowned and instructed. Yi Tian was always rude. If he offended that mighty figure, he couldn’t protect him. Even the Evil Heavenly Emperor had to be polite to that mighty figure and did not dare to offend him. Yi Tian curled his lips and he did not continue. He only sighed. The Heavenly Court army continued forward.
 At the same time. Outside the netherworld, in the city of the Calamity Race.
 Divine Lord Peacock sat in the quiet palace. Sensing something, he suddenly opened his eyes. A gust of wind blew towards him. The door was clearly closed and there were no windows.
 Divine Lord Peacock’s eyes narrowed as an invisible aura dispersed the strange wind in front of him. “I was wondering who it was. So it’s you, Sacred True Martial. What? You’re also here to attack the Heavenly Dao?” Divine Lord Peacock mocked. With that said, a figure appeared in front of him. The two of them remained ten steps apart.
 Sacred True Martial wore a white robe. His hair was white like a galaxy waterfall and scattered down his shoulders. He had a handsome face and a refined temperament. Compared to Divine Lord Peacock, he gave off a refreshing feeling without any pressure. Sacred True Martial smiled. “No, I’m here to stop you.”
 “You?”
 Divine Lord Peacock stood up as five-colored light lit up behind him. Sacred True Martial said, “Divine Lord, why? We shouldn’t participate in the schemes of the Great Dao Sages. Chess is necessary for the Great Dao Sages, but also not necessary. Do you understand?”
 Divine Lord Peacock said disdainfully, “Then, who are you here for? Which Great Dao Sage?” Sacred True Martial shook his head. “I’m here for you. In this Chaos, the only cultivator I admire is you. I don’t want you to go deep into the mud. Recently, the Heavenly Court’s Evil Heavenly Emperor invited me to join the Heavenly Court. He told me his plan. I think it’s very good. I hope you can join us.”
 Heavenly Court!
 Divine Lord Peacock narrowed his eyes. Sacred True Martial continued, “The Evil Heavenly Emperor is different from the previous Heavenly Emperor. He has already escaped the Great Dao Sage’s control. His Heavenly Court has obtained the recognition of the Inauspicious Evil. Sooner or later, he will unite the Dark Forbidden Zone. If…”
 “Hmph! Shut up. You think you can persuade
 me?”
 Divine Lord Peacock suddenly waved his sleeve and a five-colored divine light shot out, sweeping Sacred True Martial away.
 Immediately after, Divine Lord Peacock vanished from the hall.
 Inside the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 Han Jue, who was cultivating, sensed two extremely strong battle auras. He opened his eyes and saw Divine Lord Peacock fighting a white-robed man.
 Who was this?
 Invited by Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du? Han Jue watched for a while and felt that something was wrong. These two were sparring, right? The battle was too gentle!
 Han Jue lost interest and continued his seclusion. He closed his eyes and opened them again. Another thousand years passed. Han Jue stood up and twisted his waist while checking his emails.
 (Your disciple Dao Sovereign was attacked by the living beings of the Calamity Race] x7932005
 [Your son Han Tuo was attacked by the living beings of the Calamity Race) x6982233
 [Your disciple Yang Tiandong was ravaged by a mysterious array formation and was severely injured.]
 (Your good friend Empress Houtu was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure. Her Dao heart was damaged.]
 (Your good friend South Extreme Heavenly Venerate was cursed by a mysterious curse.]
 (Your good friend Pan Xin has obtained Pangu’s will. His bloodline has transformed and his cultivation has increased greatly.)
 (Your descendant Han Yu was attacked by the living beings of the Calamity Race) x80921
 (Your disciple Ji Xianshen was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure and was severely injured.)
 How tragic!
 Another thousand years passed. The Calamity Race still occupied the netherworld. The Heavenly Dao living beings came one after another, but they couldn’t drive the Calamity Race out. Now, the Jie School, the Chan School, the Human School, the Buddhist Sect, the Holy Mother Sect, and so on were all constantly sending disciples to reinforce the netherworld.
 The Sages had never attacked. They couldn’t make a move in the Heavenly Dao, but there was Divine Lord Peacock outside the Heavenly Dao. They were not his match.
 Han Jue noticed that Pan Xin had obtained Pangu’s will.
 Tsk tsk, this Pan surname was truly suitable! He checked his interpersonal relationships. Pan Xin’s cultivation had already reached the perfected Pseudo-Sage Realm. It increased very quickly.
 He checked Dao Sovereign’s profile picture again. This kid did not let him down. Early-stage Pseudo-Sage Realm! He finally broke through!
 Han Jue smiled in satisfaction.
 He looked outside the netherworld again. Divine Lord Peacock and the other Freedom Sage had already disappeared. Eh?
 This was a good opportunity!
 Han Jue’s Sage Sense swept over and discovered that the strongest person in the Calamity Race was only a perfected Primordial Chaos Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal. He was equivalent to a perfected Heavenly Dao Sage.
 “I’m going out to capture the Sage of the Calamity Race this time with all my might. I’ll return after capturing him. Is my life in danger?”
 (Ten billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?] Continue!
 [Not for the time being.)
 Seeing these words, Han Jue immediately disappeared from the Daoist temple.
 In the city.
 Patriarch Heavenly Calamity Emperor was cultivating in his palace. She had the image of a woman and wore black armor. Her bearing was extraordinary. Like the other members of the Calamity Race, she exuded a cold and sinister aura. Heavenly Calamity Emperor suddenly sensed something and opened his eyes.
 Almost instantly, a figure shining with divine light appeared behind her. A hand landed on her shoulder, making her unable to move.
 Imprisonment Great Dao! It was Han Jue!
 He grabbed Heavenly Calamity Emperor and left, returning to his Daoist temple. Heavenly Calamity Emperor widened her eyes and looked at him in shock. Impossible!
 Heavenly Calamity Emperor was helpless and could only panic. “Who are you!” Heavenly Calamity Emperor asked in a low voice. She was at the perfected Primordial Chaos Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm and was only a step away from the Freedom Realm!
 Han Jue threw her into the Primordial Heavenly Prison without saying anything. Heavenly Calamity Emperor asked, “Are you the Freedom Sage who killed the Dark Sage King?”
 Han Jue remained silent.
 Heavenly Calamity Emperor kept asking questions.
 Han Jue was impatient. He used the power of the Bewitching Fiendcelestial to pull the Heavenly Calamity Emperor into an endless illusion. The Dao Field immediately quietened down. Next, Han Jue waited for the Primordial Heavenly Prison to succeed.
 The news of Heavenly Calamity Emperor’s disappearance did not spread. She usually cultivated in seclusion, and the living beings in the clan did not dare to disturb her.
 Three hundred years later, Divine Lord Peacock returned
 Discovering that Heavenly Calamity Emperor’s aura had vanished, he immediately came to her cultivation palace.


 His eyes reflected a strange light. In his vision, everything that had happened in the palace kept replaying in front of him.
 Soon, he saw Han Jue capture Heavenly Calamity Emperor.
 He frowned. Too fast! The other party’s speed was not inferior to his! He could also directly capture Heavenly Calamity Emperor, but that would require his full strength. Divine Lord Peacock did not stay any longer and vanished.
 Sometime later, the Calamity Race finally discovered that Heavenly Calamity Emperor had disappeared. However, the upper echelons controlled the news. The current Calamity Race could no longer retreat, let alone when they had occupied the netherworld. There was no need to retreat.
 The Calamity Race controlled the news, but they couldn’t hide it from the Sages.
 Outside the 33rd Heaven, Universal Hall. The Sages gathered. Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “The leader of the Calamity Race, Heavenly Calamity Emperor, has disappeared.
 We have to be wary of this.” Fang Liang frowned. “Divine Lord Peacock is still around and the Calamity Race has not descended into chaos. Could it be that Heavenly Calamity Emperor has gone to seek help?” Qiu Xilai shook his head. “Now that the Calamity Race has the upper hand, why would they need helpers??The Calamity Race wants to dominate the Immortal World.”
 The other Sages also discussed. Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du had a headache. The Calamity Race was really too strong. There was even a Freedom Sage guarding outside. They could only worry outside the 33rd Heaven.
 Outside the 33rd Heaven was the top level of the Heavenly Dao. It was a space exclusive to Sages. Here, they could still enjoy the Heavenly Dao’s protection.
 The Sages were afraid of Divine Lord Peacock and could only hide here. They were very aggrieved. “Let’s wait and see. At least the situation is stable,” Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said. Qiu Xilai said, “This battle has stimulated many geniuses. The new generation of cultivators is beginning to gradually ascend the stage.
 The Heavenly Dao in the future will definitely be powerful.” The other Sages nodded. Although the Heavenly Dao had suffered heavy losses, countless experts had also appeared. This was also the reason why they were not in a?hurry.
 Shi Dudao snorted. “I’m just afraid that we won’t be able to survive until then. The Calamity Race can clearly invade the Yang Realm, but they didn’t. It’s obvious that there’s a huge conspiracy, but we don’t even know what they want to do.”
 Universal Hall fell silent again.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du was also thinking, What does the Calamity Race want?
 Although the difference in cultivation between them was great, he had to be cautious. He could reach this point because he was cautious! Han Jue observed the situation in the netherworld and waited patiently. After Heavenly Calamity Emperor disappeared, the Calamity Race was as usual.
 Dao Sovereign wasn’t the most glorious Pseudo-Sage. There were a few others whose battle achievements were even more ferocious than Dao Sovereign. Among them were the Divine Might Buddha of the Buddhist Sect, the Sect Master of the Jie School, Huang Zuntian, the Divine Palace’s Jing Tiangong, and other familiar faces.
 Divine Lord Peacock did not move. Compared to the beginning of the war, it had been much quieter recently. Han Jue was secretly pleased. I’ll give you a surprise when I enslave the Calamity Race! The Calamity Race was called the strongest race in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End. It would be a pity to destroy them. It was better to accept them and make them the guardians of the Heavenly
 Dao.
 Furthermore, after he captured Heavenly Calamity Emperor, he did not attract any hatred notifications from the mighty figures. This meant that Heavenly Calamity Emperor had no stronger backer. Otherwise, he would directly hate Han Jue like Qiu Xilai.
 Han Jue had already thought of the arrangements for the Calamity Race. He was waiting for the enslavement to succeed!
 Immortal World, a human city.
 Halfway up the mountain, a cloth-robed youth with messy hair faced the sun. His robes fluttered as he absorbed the Eastern Emergence Purple Qi. The cloth-robed youth suddenly opened his eyes. His ordinary facial features suddenly looked sinister as black scales appeared on his face.
 A voice entered his ears.
 “Your Highness, what are you waiting for? Are you going to let His Majesty down?” The cloth-robed youth’s expression returned to normal. “I don’t want to join the Sage Sect. My potential is enough to grow on my own.”
 “No! You have to join. This is His Majesty’s order!”
 “I don’t want to flatter you. Why won’t you give me time? I can rely on myself to reach the peak of cultivation!”
 The mysterious voice was silent.
 The cloth-robed youth closed his eyes and continued cultivating. “Are you really unwilling?”
 “Yes, I want to rely on myself. Don’t worry, I won’t forget my race.”
 “Hehe.”
 Another 400 years passed.
 [Primordial Heavenly Prison has successfully enslaved the target.)
 [Heavenly Calamity Emperor has a favorable impression of you. Current favorability: Max.)
 Han Jue looked at the two lines of words that finally appeared in front of him and heaved a sigh of relief.
 He checked Heavenly Calamity Emperor’s profile picture. (Heavenly Calamity Emperor: Perfected Primordial Chaos Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal, leader of the Calamity Race, Immeasurable Emperor, Connate lifeform. Favorability towards you is maxed.)
 At this realm, if he took another step forward, he would reach the Freedom Realm!
 Han Jue looked at the Heavenly Calamity Emperor and suddenly felt that this woman was not bad-looking Heavenly Calamity Emperor opened her eyes and knelt in front of Han Jue respectfully, calling him Master. Han Jue asked, “Who did you listen to before?” Heavenly Calamity Emperor said, “I didn’t listen to anyone. I just had an agreement with a Great Dao Sage.”
 “Why didn’t you attack the living world?” “I’m afraid there will be an accident. After all, the Flame Race has all perished there. I sent my son to the cycle of reincarnation to be reincarnated as a living being of the Heavenly Dao. In the future, when the Calamity Race dominates the netherworld, we will discuss with the Sages and promote my son to a Sage.
 “That’s just what the Great Dao Sage thinks. Destroying the Heavenly Dao is not beneficial to the Calamity Race. I don’t want to be a pawn for the Great Dao Sage for nothing.
 If I can control the Heavenly Dao alone, I will have the right to challenge the Great Dao Sage. The Heavenly Lord of Primordial Beginning said that he would give me a chance to attain the Great Dao, but I don’t believe it. They’re too arrogant. Everything is just empty talk.” Heavenly Calamity Emperor looked disdainful. It had to be said that from Heavenly Calamity Emperor’s point of view, this was a very good plan.
 Unfortunately, she met Han Jue. Han Jue instructed, “You can talk to Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du. The netherworld is divided into half and the Calamity Race will stay there. As for the authority of reincarnation, we’ll talk about it in the future.”
 Heavenly Calamity Emperor immediately agreed. Han Jue waved his hand and sent her out of the Heavenly Dao.
 Heavenly Calamity Emperor sent a voice transmission to Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du. She couldn’t enter the Heavenly Dao and could only send a voice transmission.
 Upon hearing that Heavenly Calamity Emperor wanted to negotiate peace, Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du subconsciously became vigilant. The Calamity Race was in such a good state.
