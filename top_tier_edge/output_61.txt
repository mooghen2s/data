 “Nothing. I’m just feeling uneasy,” Han Yu replied casually and put down his hand.
 Why was this happening?
 He could only wait uneasily. At this moment, he didn’t know who to ask for help. Besides, there was no fatal danger.
 At the same time, in the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 Han Jue was still helping Xing Hongxuan give birth.
 Her abdomen was already the size of a normal ten-month pregnancy. It was still beating. The fetus was very lively. Every time it beat, it would cause thunder to rumble. It appeared out of thin air and was deafening.
 Han Jue was speechless. What was this?

 Xing Hongxuan was relieved because of his help, and she even began to look forward to her son’s potential.
 Han Jue kept transforming Ultimate Origin Power into Supreme Power for his son to absorb. It was equivalent to imparting strength.
 This kid’s Primordial Physique was indeed impressive. Han Jue’s Stellar Primordial Body was not so domineering.
 ......
 The Stellar Primordial Body was mainly to create the Primordial World. Could it be that his son’s physique was to absorb?
 Han Jue didn’t know and was looking forward to it.
 “Husband, what do you think our son’s name should be?”
 “Yes… let’s call him Han Huang. It means pioneer.”
 “Pioneer? Of what?” Xing Hongxuan asked curiously
 It was naturally the pioneer who would open the Primordial Chaos!
 However, Han Jue couldn’t say it directly.
 Xing Hongxuan was enlightened. “This name doesn’t sound good, but the meaning is alright. I’ll listen to you.”
 At this point, his youngest son had a new name, Han Huang.
 As Han Huang continued to absorb the Supreme Power, the providence cloud at the top of the Heavenly Dao surged violently. It was terrifying, as if a calamity had descended. The Sages gathered in the Universal Hall. They were all flustered. The previous phenomenon had just ended when a new one appeared.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du had no choice but to send a voice transmission to Han Jue, “Heavenly Sage, sorry to disturb you. The Heavenly Dao is abnormal. You have to see what happened.”
 Han Jue replied, “Don’t panic. I’m just creating a Mystical Power. It won’t endanger the Heavenly Dao.”
 Hearing this, Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du heaved a sigh of relief and hurriedly told the other Sages about this. The Sages were relieved.
 The Foolish Sword Sage frowned.
 He was really creating a Mystical Power.
 No!
 He couldn’t allow him to pull further apart!
 The Foolish Sword Sage immediately disappeared and returned to his Dao Field to cultivate.
 He seemed to be convinced by Han Jue, but he had always had the ambition to surpass him.
 Days passed. The providence at the top of the Heavenly Dao kept surging. Fortunately, it did not affect the myriad worlds.
 Xing Hongxuan was finally about to give birth after ten months.
 Han Jue was personally responsible for delivering the baby.
 The process was not difficult. Soon, Han Huang was born.
 A golden light flashed in Han Jue’s arms. In the golden light was a fetus. Its body was golden and its eyes were like purple crystals. Its facial features were exquisite, but it looked quite strange overall.
 “Waa—”
 A loud cry sounded like a thunderclap. The entire Heavenly Dao and even the living beings in the Chaotic Domain controlled by the Divine Robe Daoist could hear it.
 Han Jue was shocked. Why was he crying so loudly?
 He hurriedly used the Ultimate Origin Power to isolate the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 A golden light pierced through the Daoist temple, through the array formation of the Dao Field, and shot into the sky. It pierced through the 33rd Heaven and broke through the top of the Heavenly Dao. It rushed all the way up as if it wanted to break through the peak of the Chaos.
 Han Jue was helpless. He couldn’t stop this kid?
 Three Pure Sacred World.
 The Three Pure Sages were discussing the Dao when they were interrupted by Han Huang’s cries. They had just stopped when the cries stopped.
 “The crying just now…”
 The Heavenly Sect Master narrowed his eyes.
  Laozi counted with his fingers and said, “A prodigy has appeared in the Heavenly Dao.”
 The Heavenly Lord of Primordial Beginning asked curiously, “What prodigy? How can the cries reach here? From the sound, he’s just born?”
 “That’s right. He was just born. His cultivation level…”
 Laozi frowned. After a pause, he continued, “He’s born as Freedom. It’s unprecedented.”
 Born as Freedom!
 The Heavenly Sect Master and the Heavenly Lord of Primordial Beginning were moved.
 In the mysterious palace.
 The Divine Robe Daoist, who was cultivating, opened his eyes and frowned at the Heavenly Dao.
 “Born as Freedom… The Heavenly Dao actually has such a figure? Could it be Master’s doing?”
 The Divine Robe Daoist was shocked at first, but then pleasantly surprised.
 Such a prodigy would definitely achieve good results in the Chaotic Assembly. At that time, he would be proud if he said it. After all, the Heavenly Dao was in his domain.
 He was filled with admiration for Han Jue.
 As expected of Master!
 He made up his mind to meet that new prodigy in the future and build a good relationship with him in advance.
 On the other side.
 In a dark domain.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor was meditating. In front of him was the Formless Transcendent Deity shining with a strong
 light.
 “The Heavenly Dao has changed. Someone was born as Freedom. An impressive existence is about to appear,” the Formless Transcendent God suddenly said, startling the Evil Heavenly Emperor.
 This place was too far from the Heavenly Dao. The Evil Heavenly Emperor did not hear Han Huang’s cries.
 “You mean…” the Evil Heavenly Emperor asked carefully.
 The Formless Transcendent Deity replied, “A newborn fetus. He was born as Freedom, a feat that has never been seen since ancient times. He’s Han Jue’s son.”
 Born as Freedom!
 Han Jue’s son!
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor was shocked.
 Han Tuo’s potential had already stunned him. He didn’t expect Han Jue to give birth to an even more exaggerated prodigy.
 Born as Freedom…
 How high was the upper limit?
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor’s heart beat faster and his eyes burned.
 He wanted to help Han Jue raise his child!
 The Formless Transcendent Deity added, “This child will change the Chaos. I wonder what kind of change it will be.”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor said, “I’ll teach him personally.”
 “Hehe, you want to teach him? That might not be the case.”
 “Why do you say that?”
 “He’s born as Freedom. The way he looks at everything will be different from all living beings. His birth destined the difference between his extraordinariness and all living beings. If there is a natural-born god, it will be him. No existence has been born as Freedom since ancient times.”
 The Formless Transcendent Deity’s words caused the Evil Heavenly Emperor to fall into deep thought.
 In the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 The golden light dissipated. The ten million disciples were still shocked and discussing curiously.
 Xuan Qingjun, Fairy Xi Xuan, and Chang Yue’er rushed over. Han Jue didn’t ignore them and let them in.
 The three women were surprised to see the baby in his arms.
 “Let me hug him!” Chang Yue’er said excitedly.
 Han Jue shook his head. “No, this kid is already a Freedom Sage. He can easily hurt
 you.”
 Freedom Sage!
 The three women were stunned.
 This child was far stronger than them from the moment he was born?
 Erm…
 They were all dumbfounded.
 At this moment, Xing Hongxuan tidied her clothes and walked over. She stared at Han Huang and frowned. “Why are his eyes so ugly?”
 The purple eyes looked strange. As if sensing his mother’s disdain, Han Huang’s eyes quickly returned to white with black pupils. His skin also returned to the appearance of a normal human child, but it was slightly pale and immediately became pink and cute.


 “Wow! He can understand you?” Chang Yue’er shouted in surprise, looking at Han Huang with fondness.
 This kid was indeed cute.
 As if understanding Chang Yue’er’s words, Han Huang actually flew out of Han Jue’s arms. Unfortunately, he grabbed his foot and pulled him back.
 Han Huang frowned and reached out to grab him.
 “This kid is quite fierce.”
 Xuan Qingjun laughed. Han Jue slapped Han Huang’s butt loudly.
 He could sense that Han Huang’s intelligence was not high. It was at most like a two- or three-year-old. However, his physical talent was high and he could instinctively control the changes.
 Han Huang didn’t cry after being beaten by him. Instead, he stared at him with a very angry expression.
 Han Jue was amused and slapped him again.

 This kid still didn’t cry after ten consecutive slaps. He still stared at him.
 “Oh my, what are you doing!”
 Xing Hongxuan took Han Huang and glared at him.
 ......
 Xuan Qingjun and the other two also started to blame him.
 Han Jue was helpless and didn’t dare to refute.
 Xuan Qingjun and the other two left after playing with the baby for a while.
 Han Jue brought Xing Hongxuan and her son to the third Dao Field to see Qingluan’er and Han Qing’er.
 “My second brother was born?” Han Qing’er shouted in surprise. Then, she went in front of Han Jue and looked at the swaddled Han Huang. Her eyes instantly lit up and she reached out to take him.
 Qingluan’er held Xing Hongxuan’s arm and asked about the delivery.
 Han Jue reminded her, “Be careful. Your second brother is a Freedom Sage. He might hurt you.”
 “What? Freedom? Wasn’t he just born?”
 Han Qing’er was shocked. The hand holding the swaddle trembled.
 “After all, it has been nurtured for so many
 years.”
 “But this is…”
 Han Huang seemed to be amused by her expression. He chuckled and raised his two small hands, wanting to scratch her face.
 Han Qing’er could only forcefully calm down upon seeing how cute he was.
 She began to tease Han Huang.
 Qingluan’er exclaimed, “Born as Freedom. He should be the number one in the Chaos,
 right?”
 Xing Hongxuan smiled. “Probably. Speaking of which, my cultivation level is also thanks to him.”
 During the period when Han Huang was about to be born, her cultivation level also increased rapidly.
 “Sister is really lucky.”
 “No, Qing’er is so obedient. Although this kid is talented, he will definitely be a restless person in the future.”
 “Bring him over if you have nothing to do in the future. I think Qing’er likes him very much.”
 “I’ll stay here and see this kid grow up.”
 “That’s great.”
 Han Jue ignored the two women’s conversation and looked at Han Huang.
 Han Qing’er raised him in the air and made him laugh even more.
 The newly born Han Huang was already like a two-year-old. He looked innocent, but Han Jue felt that this kid was strange.
 Not to mention the future he saw in the illusion, he didn’t cry when Han Jue hit him earlier. Instead, he stared at him without fear. That gaze was something.
 This kid would probably scare others until their legs went weak when he grew up.
 Han Jue thought silently.
 Qingluan’er brought Han Huang to the other disciples to play. In the end, not long after, Han Huang accidentally injured a disciple. Fortunately, Han Jue was there. Otherwise, that disciple would have been slapped until his soul dissipated.
  Han Jue was even more surprised.
 Could it be that this kid could already tell his family apart?
 Facing Han Qing’er, he was like an ordinary baby. Facing other disciples, his movements were heavy and he subconsciously wanted to use his Connate Dharmic powers.
 Han Qing’er was shocked by Han Huang’s attack and did not know what to do.
 Han Jue raised his hand and sucked Han Huang over.
 Han Huang bared his fangs and brandished his claws. He was very dissatisfied to be grabbed by Han Jue after returning to his arms.
 Xing Hongxuan walked over and frowned. “Husband, you have to discipline this kid well…”
 She had also seen the scene just now. If not for her son, she would probably be as shocked as Han Qing’er.
 Han Jue said, “I know.”
 He looked around at the nearby disciples. All of them looked terrified and did not dare to approach.
 Han Jue was helpless.
 Indeed.
 This kid was really a little overlord.
 It was impossible for all children to be gentle towards him.
 Just like that, Han Jue began to personally take care of Han Huang. Xing Hongxuan pulled Qingluan’er to the side of Han Jue’s Daoist temple and prepared to open a new Daoist temple. She couldn’t always cultivate under the tree. In any case, Xing Hongxuan did not like that.
 Time passed quickly.
 Two years passed in a flash.
 Han Jue had always been staring at Han Huang, afraid that this kid would hurt someone.
 He did not restrain Han Huang and usually let Han Qing’er play with him.
 On this day.
 Han Huang and Han Qing’er were under the old tree. Han Qing’er recounted what she had seen in the Immortal World. Han Huang lay in front of her, holding his cheeks with both hands and shaking his legs.
 The two-year-old Han Huang wore a golden silk white robe. His pupils were purple, and he was cute and divine.
 After growing up, he saw that Han Jue’s pupils were red, so he no longer hid his purple eyes.
 Han Huang was puzzled upon hearing the story.
 “Qing’er, why does that person want revenge?” Han Huang asked.
 Han Qing’er smiled. “If someone kills me and our parents, would you want to kill that person?”
 Han Huang tilted his head and said, “How can anyone kill you guys?”
 Han Qing’er was stunned. “What if?”
 “That’s not possible.”
 “Because I will protect you.”
 “There are many people stronger than you in the Chaos. Besides, you can’t stay with us forever.”
 “Then, I’ll kill all the Chaotic lifeforms. This way, no one can kill you.”
 “You…”
 Han Qing’er was so angry that she raised her hand to hit him. However, on second thought, he was the elder brother. How could a younger sister hit her elder brother?
 She then said, “You already want to kill without grudges, let alone him who has a blood feud.”
 “No, he’s not worthy.”
  “Why not?”
 “He’s so weak. Why does he want to kill someone stronger than him and want others to help?”
 “What nonsense are you saying? Should the weak be bullied by the strong?”
 “What else?”
 “Hehe. Then, what if you’re bullied by stronger people?”
 “No, no one can bully me.”
 Han Qing’er almost died of anger.
 This kid was asking for a beating and had a problem with his brain.
 At this moment, Han Jue walked over and said, “Huang’er, are you bullying your sister again?”
 Han Huang hurriedly jumped up and scratched his head. “No way. How can I bully her? She’s the one who bullied me.”
 He was most afraid of his father because only he dared to hit him. He couldn’t fight back, and it hurt every time.


 “I bullied you? You’re so powerful. Who dares to bully you?”
 Han Qing’er snorted. She really had no choice when it came to this brother of hers. It was always very infuriating when they interacted. However, Han Huang would always be the first to look for her after the two of them fell out. He would stare at her seriously, making her heart soften easily.
 They were more like elder sister and younger brother.
 Han Jue picked Han Huang up.
 “What are you doing! Let go of me!”
 Han Huang struggled with all his might. He waved his hands and wanted to resist, but his arms were too short, and he couldn’t touch Han Jue.
 He had Freedom Dharmic powers, but he didn’t know how to use a Mystical Power.
 Han Jue said, “You brat, don’t always bully your sister. You even said that you wanted to protect us. You don’t even dare to admit that you bullied her.”
 Han Huang shouted, “I’m not bullying her. I’m just chatting with her normally. I’m saying what’s on my mind. I’m not scolding her. How is that bullying? Aren’t we talking about others?”
  Han Qing’er said angrily, “Father, this kid actually wants to slaughter all the living beings in the Chaos. He thinks that he’s born superior to others. Don’t you think it’s infuriating?”
 Han Huang said aggrievedly, “What’s wrong with that? I think the disciples in the Dao Field are all very weak. Am I not just a few levels higher than them? It’s already like this here. Could it be that the living beings of the Chaos are stronger than me?”
 Han Qing’er choked.
 She suddenly realized something.
 She really couldn’t think of Han Huang as a mortal or an immortal.
 Han Qing’er couldn’t help but feel tiny as she looked at his expression.
 Han Jue carried Han Huang and asked, “Do you want to go to the Immortal World?”
 Han Huang’s eyes lit up. He hurriedly nodded. “Yes! Yes! Father! Bring me there!”
 Han Qing’er was also interested and looked at him expectantly.
 Han Jue waved his sleeve and brought the siblings back to the main Dao Field. He sealed Han Huang and Han Qing’er’s cultivation levels. A Freedom Sage couldn’t enter the Heavenly Dao.
 Then, he entered the Immortal World with his soul fragment. His transformation methods were unfathomable, so Han Qing’er and Han Huang didn’t sense anything when he switched to his soul fragment.
 The family of three traveled the Immortal World and went to places with many people and demons. Han Qing’er was very excited and kept introducing the various things along the way to Han Huang.
 At first, Han Huang was also very excited. But he calmed down not long after.
 Several days later.
 Han Huang interrupted Han Qing’er and said impatiently, “That’s all. It’s not fun at all. Father, when are we going back?”
 Han Jue pretended to be surprised and asked, “Why not? Don’t you find it interesting?”
 Han Huang shook his head.
 Han Huang curled his lips and said, “It’s not new at all. They only look like us, but they’re actually different. They’re no different from the flowers and insects by the roadside.”
 Han Jue frowned.
 For some reason, he saw a hint of loneliness in his eyes.
 This kid is interesting.
 Such emotions at such a young age? Thinking about it carefully, it made sense. He was the only Primordial Fiendcelestial in the world now.
 Han Huang was very excited at first. He only wanted to find the aura of his own kind. However, after walking for so long, he did not encounter the aura of the Primordial Fiendcelestial. He was naturally disappointed.
 Han Qing’er was not a Primordial Fiendcelestial. In the end, she was still a human. Looking up, they were all of the same race, so everything was naturally new.
 Han Jue smiled and waved his sleeve to bring the siblings back.
 Back in the third Dao Field.
 
 Han Qing’er left the Daoist temple regretfully, but Han Huang did not.
 He stood in front of his father and lowered his head.
 Han Jue sat on the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus and asked with a smile, “What’s wrong, Huang’er?”
 Han Huang looked up and stared at him. “Father, why is my aura different from yours? Am I really your child?”
 Han Jue smiled. “Of course. Your mother nurtured you for millions of years before giving birth to you. How can you not be our child?”
 “Then, my aura and yours…”
 “I was like you in the past. Later, I became stronger,” Han Jue explained simply. He had to remind Han Huang about the Primordial Fiendcelestial after he grew up.
 Anyway, Han Jue wouldn’t let him go out alone for now. The Primordial Fiendcelestial’s identity was too sensitive. At the very least, this kid had to have the ability to protect himself. It was best to cultivate beside him until he achieved the Great Dao Supreme Realm.
 Han Huang heaved a sigh of relief when he heard that. He even patted his chest, looking very cute. He didn’t have the terrifying appearance of the Primordial Fiendcelestial at
 all.
 Han Jue raised his hand and pulled him into his arms. “Huang’er, you are indeed extraordinary. But remember, many people are stronger than you in this world. When you grow up, you have to cultivate well and not slack off.”
 Han Huang looked up and asked curiously, “Father, how strong are you?”
 Han Jue smiled and said, “I’m stronger than
 you.”
 “Indeed. When you hit me, I couldn’t even resist.”
 “What? You still want to resist?”
 “Hehe…”
 Han Huang scratched his head and smiled foolishly. Han Jue couldn’t help but pinch his face.
 It was strange. Han Huang’s personality was stranger than Han Tuo’s and Han Qing’er’s, but he inexplicably liked him the most.
 It was not because of potential, but affinity.
 The father and son began to chat. Such opportunities were rare.
 As for Xing Hongxuan, she was busy cultivating. He rarely saw her.
 Several years later.
 Having just turned ten, Han Huang began to cultivate on his own. However, it was a little humiliating for the Primordial Fiendcelestial’s potential without an orthodox cultivation technique. Han Jue called him over and taught him the Great Dao of Extreme Origin.
 Under the old tree.
 Qingluan’er sat beside Han Qing’er and sighed. “Huang’er started cultivating at such a young age. Men are really different. Back then, your father had to force you to cultivate.”
 Han Qing’er curled her lips and said, “Second Brother has good potential and a high sense of achievement from cultivation. He naturally likes to cultivate.”
 The latest_epi_sodes are on_the ʟɪʙʀᴇᴀᴅ.ᴄᴏᴍ. website.
 Qingluan’er rolled her eyes at her, knowing that this girl was teasing her again.
 At this moment, Han Huang ran out of the Daoist temple and stopped in front of them. “Qing’er, I just learned a Mystical Power. Do you want to spar?”
 The Primordial Fiendcelestial’s potential was extraordinary. In less than half a year, he walked the Great Dao of Extreme Origin and even learned a Mystical Power.
 The ten-year-old Han Huang was already a handsome youth with an imposing appearance.
 Han Qing’er asked angrily, “Are you bullying me?”
 This kid was a Freedom Sage. How could she defeat him?
 For some reason, Han Qing’er thought of Jiang Jueshi.
 He was also a Freedom Sage. She didn’t know if he could deal with Han Huang in this universe.
 Han Huang sighed. “No one can fight me. I don’t even know how strong I am. The disciples in the Dao Field are too weak. I’m afraid of killing them.”
 Han Qing’er said, “You want to find an opponent? One of Father’s disciples is outside the Dao Field. His name is Jiang Jueshi. He’s also at the Freedom Realm. Go beg my father to let you fight him.”
 Only 1 chapter today next chapter will be posted maybe in few hours or tomorrow


 “Father has such a powerful disciple?” Han Huang asked in surprise. He had never seen a Hidden Sect disciple before.
 Han Qing’er nodded impatiently.
 Now, she was annoyed when she saw Han Huang. Comparisons were really infuriating.
 Han Huang immediately ran back to find his father.
 Han Jue felt that it was feasible.
 Han Huang wasn’t Jiang Jueshi’s match, and he was only ten years old now. It was enough to shock Jiang Jueshi and give him a sense of danger.
 Han Jue’s body emitted a divine light. Han Huang widened his eyes and opened his mouth.
 He imitated it, and his body emitted a purple light. Then, he sized himself up and was extremely happy.
 Han Jue waved his hand and moved Jiang Jueshi into the Daoist temple.
  Jiang Jueshi was meditating and cultivating when he suddenly sensed Han Huang’s aura. He couldn’t help but open his eyes.
 Han Huang was staring at him with a burning gaze at this moment.
 He saw Han Jue and hurriedly knelt.
 “Greetings, Master.”
 Although Han Jue had never revealed his true body, his figure was unforgettable.
 Han Jue said, “I called you here today to let you spar with your junior. This is my son, Han Huang. He just turned ten.”
 Jiang Jueshi was stunned. He was asked to spar with a ten-year-old child?
 He was suddenly moved.
 He stared at Han Huang in disbelief.
 He gritted his teeth and asked, “Are you Freedom?”
 Han Huang said proudly, “That’s right. I was born in the Freedom Realm.”
 He naturally had some understanding of cultivation realms after stepping into the Great Dao of Extreme Origin.
 Hearing this, Jiang Jueshi’s pupils dilated as waves surged in his heart.
 He couldn’t help but look at Han Jue.
 Han Jue said, “This child was born after being nurtured in his mother’s womb for millions of years. He was indeed born as Freedom.”
 Jiang Jueshi was silent.
 He was still shocked.
 If he calculated the time it took to be nurtured, then with his potential accumulated over ten thousand years, he was still inferior to Han Huang.
 He suddenly understood Liu Bei’s words. Han Jue really didn’t care about his potential.
 Jiang Jueshi frowned. He didn’t expect this child to not care about morals.
 On second thought, the other party was only ten years old. How could he know so much?
 Han Jue said, “I’m not asking you to fight here. I’ll pull you into an illusion. You can use your full strength and won’t really hurt the other party there. In addition, you can choose other opponents in this illusion. They’re all opponents I’ve encountered in my life. They’re of various realms.”
 With that, he gave Han Huang and Jiang Jueshi the authority to enter the simulation trial and pulled them into the battle.
 He sent a voice transmission to Jiang Jueshi, “This kid is still immature. Go all out. Don’t hold back.”
 Jiang Jueshi was originally hesitant, but he immediately understood when he heard this.
 So Master wanted to train Little Junior Brother.
 It made sense when he thought about it. How arrogant was he to be born as Freedom?
 Jiang Jueshi felt proud. He believed that it was rare for him to encounter an opponent at his realm, let alone a young child.
 The battle quickly began!
 The first to attack was naturally Han Huang, who was then immediately suppressed.
 Han Jue watched the battle. He accidentally discovered that Han Huang’s body was very strong. Jiang Jueshi couldn’t kill him instantly even if he beat him.
 Han Huang finally lost after ten breaths of time.
 The two of them opened their eyes. Jiang Jueshi had a strange expression. He felt an unprecedented sense of urgency.
 This kid’s body was not simple!
 Han Huang stared at him and gritted his teeth. “Again!”
 Jiang Jueshi glanced at Han Jue. He agreed to continue sparring upon seeing the latter’s nod.
 Several hours later.
 Han Huang had already been defeated fifty times, but he lasted longer and longer after every fight. Jiang Jueshi looked at him as if he was a monster.
 “Thank you, Master.”
 Jiang Jueshi cupped his fists and bowed. Then, he walked to the side and sat cross-legged to meditate.
 Han Huang kept staring at him. His eyes were not fierce or afraid, but very serious and cold.
 Jiang Jueshi inexplicably felt that he was prey and couldn’t help but be afraid.
 He had to work hard in the future. He couldn’t let this kid catch up.
 Han Jue stared at him and said, “What? Can’t afford to lose?”
 Han Huang came back to his senses and looked at him. “I didn’t lose. Give me time, I’ll defeat him sooner or later.”
 “Will the enemy give you time to surpass him if you offend an enemy in the Chaos?” Han Jue said coldly. Han Huang became silent.
 After a moment of silence, he said, “Father, teach me a Mystical Power. I want to defeat him in five years!”
 Fortunately, Jiang Jueshi had already entered the simulation trial. Otherwise, it was unknown what his expression would be.
 Han Jue stared at him and asked, “What if you can’t do it?”
 Han Huang said in a low voice, “I can definitely do it!
 “He’s stronger than me now, but I feel that he’s just inferior to me. He’s only a powerful worm.”
 Han Jue said, “A fellow disciple is the same as your family, how can you describe him as a worm?”
 “I know. It’s just that the difference between us… Sigh. Father, hurry up and teach me your Mystical Power.”
 Seeing that he couldn’t explain it clearly, Han Huang pounced into Han Jue’s arms and started to act cute.
 Han Jue smiled and started to preach the Mystical Power.
 Soon, Han Huang sat in front of him and started to listen carefully.
 Three years later.
 Han Jue was still preaching when a line of words appeared in front of him.
 (The Evil Heavenly Emperor sent you a dream. Do you accept?]
 Accept.
 Han Jue thought silently and started to multitask. He preached the Dao and entered the dream.
 The dream was still the same forest outside the Jade Pure Sacred Sect.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor laughed when he saw him. “Han Jue, you gave birth to another good son?”
 Han Jue knew that Han Huang’s actions back then would definitely be caught by many mighty figures. He didn’t hide anything and just said, “Just a brat.”
 “I know that you’re usually busy cultivating. You can leave him to me if you don’t have time to take care of the child.”
 “Isn’t this too…”
 “It’s no trouble!”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor took a step forward, his eyes glowing.
 Han Jue was speechless.
 Why are you always thinking about my sons?
 Alright, his son’s potential was indeed impressive.
 Han Jue said helplessly, “You might not be able to accept this kid.”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor asked in surprise, “Why? He already has a master?”
  Han Jue explained Han Huang’s personality and ideas. In other words, the Evil Heavenly Emperor couldn’t subdue Han Huang.
 Unlike Han Tuo, Han Huang had a high starting point and was not convinced by anyone.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor was silent.
 That’s right.
 He was born as Freedom and was unprecedented. How could he take in such an existence just because he wanted to?
 Han Jue said, “Of course.”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor was a rare good friend of his. The Evil Heavenly Emperor had also done his best to help him on his path of growth. Han Jue naturally would not neglect the Evil Heavenly Emperor now that he was stronger.


 Five years passed quickly. Han Huang couldn’t wait to wake Jiang Jueshi up.
 “You want to challenge me again?”
 Jiang Jueshi frowned at the youth in front of him.
 You want to defeat me after cultivating for five years? You’re too arrogant!
 Han Huang said, “Come. I promised my father that I would defeat you in five years. The time will expire if I wait any longer.”
 Jiang Jueshi looked at Han Jue. He could only agree upon seeing that he didn’t say anything
 However, Han Jue’s voice secretly entered his ears, “Try your best to defeat him.”
 Jiang Jueshi looked at the excited and expectant Han Huang and couldn’t help but mourn.
 Jiang Jueshi was the first to speak after entering the simulation trial. “Little Junior, your potential is indeed powerful. If it was any other Freedom, you might really surpass me in five years, but it’s impossible to surpass me. I’ve never met a match in the Freedom Realm!”
  Han Huang suddenly waved his palm. Divine Might Great Heaven Palm!
 With a palm strike, space shattered. It was unstoppable!
 Jiang Jueshi drew a circle with both hands. He first used the Reincarnation Great Creation Technique and then used the Divine Might Great Heaven Palm. Its power far exceeded Han Huang’s.
 The two palms collided. The world would instantly turn into dust if they were in the Immortal World.
 The battle ended very quickly. In less than twenty breaths of time.
 Han Huang opened his eyes with a dark expression.
 Jiang Jueshi felt a little ashamed. After all, the other party was only a 15-year-old youth.
 Han Jue said, “This is the end of your spar. Jiang Jueshi, continue cultivating. Ignore him.”
 Jiang Jueshi stood up and said, “Master, I should go back and cultivate. Little Junior’s potential is indeed unheard of. I’ll definitely lose if he’s given another five years. I have to go back and cultivate to attain the Great Dao as soon as possible.”
 Han Jue nodded and waved his hand to send him back.
 Han Huang’s expression did not ease upon hearing Jiang Jueshi’s words.
 He was still shocked.
 He had said that he would defeat Jiang Jueshi in five years, but he did not. This was the first blow he had suffered in his life.
 Han Jue retracted his divine light and sighed. “Huang’er, do you understand what Father means now? That Jiang Jueshi looks like a worm, but he has great providence. In a sense, his potential is not inferior to yours.”
 Han Huang looked up and asked, “What is great providence?”
 “You will understand in the future. Your level is too low now. You won’t understand even if I say it. I just hope that you won’t doubt yourself and underestimate all living beings.”
 Han Huang took a deep breath and nodded slowly upon hearing his father’s gentle words.
 The father and son chatted for a while more before Han Huang walked out of the Daoist temple and came to Han Qing’er.
 “What’s wrong? You seem very unhappy?” Han Qing’er asked. She could tell at a glance that Han Huang was in a low mood.
 She was quite unhappy. You have such good potential, why aren’t you happy?
 Han Huang sat in front of her and said, “I can’t defeat Jiang Jueshi.”
 Han Qing’er was shocked.
 After all, in her heart, her second brother was a monster.
 Han Qing’er consoled him. “It’s fine. After all, Jiang Jueshi has cultivated for tens of thousands of years. You’ve only cultivated for a few years.”
 Han Qing’er stared at him in surprise and discovered that this kid was serious.
 She was now curious about how strong Jiang Jueshi was. He could actually make this kid so agitated.
 Han Huang turned around and left. He went to visit Xing Hongxuan and Qingluan’er to tell his two mothers about this. After all, he was still young. This was the first time he was entering seclusion and felt that it was a major event in his life.
 Xing Hongxuan and Qingluan’er found it funny, but they still reminded him seriously.
 Just like that, Han Huang returned to Han Jue’s side, and the father and son cultivated in seclusion.
 7,435 years passed in the blink of an eye.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and looked at Han Huang, who had already grown up. His eyes were filled with relief.
 His son had advanced by leaps and bounds. He had already reached the late stage of the Freedom Realm. It was not impossible for him to attain the Great Dao within 30,000 years. In this aspect, he had already surpassed his father.
 “Huang’er,” Han Jue called out softly.
 Han Huang opened his eyes and asked, “Father, what is it?”
 He stretched lazily. The father and son had not spoken ever since he had entered seclusion. He was also immersed in cultivation and could not extricate himself.
 “I’ll bring you to see someone,” Han Jue said and teleported Han Huang into the Hundred Peak Immortal River before jumping to the 33rd Heaven.
 The current 33rd Heaven could already allow Great Dao Sages to enter and leave, but only those below the Sages.
 Han Jue brought Han Huang to the Universal Hall. At this moment, the Evil Heavenly Emperor was talking to Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du. Han Huang followed behind Han Jue and was secretly curious.
 as
 What was this place?
 After entering the Universal Hall, Han Huang’s gaze landed on Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du and the Evil Heavenly Emperor. He could sense that the two of them were very strong and should be at the Freedom Realm.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor’s gaze landed on Han Huang first, and his eyes instantly shone.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor and Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du immediately stood up.
 “Haha, Han Jue, this is your son? He really looks like you.”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor sighed. Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du looked at Han Huang, and his heart palpitated.
 Freedom Realm!
 Was this the person who caused the phenomenon thousands of years ago?
 The Divine Might Heavenly Sage’s son?
 He was so strong in less than ten thousand years?
 Han Jue stopped in front of the two of them and smiled. “That’s right. His name is Han Huang, Huang’er. Aren’t you going to greet the two seniors? This is the Evil Heavenly Emperor. He helped me when I was young and is my benefactor. This is Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du, Father’s good friend.”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du, who had always been indifferent, beamed at the words ‘good friend’.
 “Han Huang greets the two seniors.”
 Han Huang cupped his fists and bowed, but his expression was not very respectful. Regarding this, the Evil Heavenly Emperor and Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du were not unhappy. Instead, they warmly took out Dharma treasures as greeting gifts.
 The two of them were very generous and took out Chaotic Numinous Treasures.
 They did not have many of such Supreme Treasures.
  The Evil Heavenly Emperor glanced at Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du and felt threatened.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du felt heartache, but he knew that this treasure no longer affected him much. After all, he didn’t need to go out and fight. It was better to rope in the future peak of the Chaos.
 That’s right.
 Han Huang was already at the peak of history in Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du’s heart.
 Even Azure Heaven Mystic was far inferior to him!
 This was the first time Han Huang had obtained a treasure. He had seen a Dharma treasure when he fought Jiang Jueshi, so he was very happy.
 “Thank you, seniors!” Han Huang took the Dharma treasures and said in surprise. His gaze became gentle as he looked at the Evil Heavenly Emperor and Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du.
 Han Jue and the other two sat down with a smile and started to chat.
 Not long after, the topic landed on Han Huang
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor smiled and said, “Huang’er, do you want to follow me into the Chaos? Your brother also followed me back then.”
