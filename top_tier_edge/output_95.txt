 Han Jue saw endless evil devils following behind the Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil. Among them was a familiar figure.
 Strange Deity!
 This strange fellow from the Evils had been growing over the years. Previously, he had even fought with Han Huang. It looked like he was doing well now that he was mixed in with the evil devils.
 He could use the Strange Deity to monitor the Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil.
 Han Jue and the Strange Deity’s soul had long fused into one. The stronger he was, the stronger the Strange Deity was. On the contrary, it was impossible for the Strange Deity to surpass him. This was also the reason why he dared to let the Strange Deity go. With him around, nothing would happen to the Strange Deity.
 Han Jue immediately sent a dream to the Strange Deity.
 The dream was a Daoist temple.
 The Strange Deity was stunned and he saw him. He hurriedly came over and nodded without his usual sinister aura.
 Han Jue said, “Why are you hanging out with the evil devils?”
 The Strange Deity was originally invisible to any existence. It was like an Inauspicious Evil that couldn’t be spied on, but it had attack power. Han Jue was not used to it now that the Strange Deity had revealed its body.
 He was not as cute as before.
 “I want to eat them. I feel that they are very strong.” The Strange Deity chuckled.
 Han Jue reminded, “Be careful. The existence behind them is not simple.”
 The Strange Deity came up to massage Han Jue’s shoulders and smiled fawningly. “Then if something happens, you have to help me, Master.”
 “I can’t help you.”
 “That’s fine. At most, I’ll die. In any case, you
 can revive me. Furthermore, it can be considered a contribution to the Chaos if I succeed.”
 The Strange Deity smiled shamelessly.
 He was indeed not as cute as before. What had this fellow absorbed? Why was he so glib?
 The Strange Deity continued to flatter Han Jue and fawn on him. Ever since he came out, this was the first time Han Jue visited him in his dreams. This made him very excited.
 After a long while…
 Han Jue instructed him and ended the dream after the Strange Deity finished speaking.
 “He even dares to devour the Ninth Chaos’ mental demon. This fellow is really bold.” Han Jue was suddenly interested in the Inauspicious Evil.
 It was even to the extent that the Inauspicious Evil actually had the same goal as the current evil devils who ran rampant in the Chaos. However, the Inauspicious Evil used the souls of living beings as the evolution process and the evil devils were directly born.
 Han Jue looked at the blank domain next.
 The Purity Great Dao World of the Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity was getting closer and closer to the Chaos. This Dao Creator was very
 strong, and so was his Great Dao World. Their arrival would definitely change the situation in the Chaos.
 Han Jue started to check his emails.
 He was mainly paying attention to Su Qi.
 [Your disciple Su Qi was attacked by a
 Transcendent Cultivator] x1920098
 [Your disciple Su Qi spread bad luck, causing a
 lineage to collapse.]
 [Your son Han Huang encountered your good friend Huang Zuntian in a dream. His soul was
 damaged.]
 [Your enemy, the Ninth Chaos, expelled his mental demon and created a clone. His
 providence has decreased greatly.]
 [Your disciple Su Qi spread bad luck, causing
 the three thousand Great Dao in the Transcendent World to be damaged.]
 [Your good friend Huang Zuntian has been
 deprived of the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority. His soul has been damaged.]
 …
 [Your good friend Chaotic Consciousness was attacked by a transcendent existence.] [Your good friend Strange Deity devoured the Chaotic Evil Devils and his cultivation level
 increased.]
 …
 Su Qi’s bad luck was as impressive as ever. His cultivation level had been increasing after so many years. He was already a Great Dao Supreme. It was not difficult to understand why he could shake the three thousand Great
 Dao.
 However, the Ninth Chaos had actually created a clone of his mental demon. This was a way.
 Some Dao Creators even fought.
 It was unknown who was bullying the Chaotic
 Consciousness.
 Han Jue concluded after reading the emails.
 Although there were endless storms and changes, his cultivation was not affected.
 He was about to close his eyes and cultivate when he suddenly felt something and disappeared from the Dao Field.
 He came to the mysterious space where the
 Dao Creators met.
 The Chaotic Consciousness, the Formless Transcendent Deity, and the Immeasurable Destruction Venerable were all here.
 Could it be that the one who attacked the
 Chaotic Consciousness was the mysterious Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity?
 “Something bad has happened. He was indeed
 cursed by the Dark Forbidden Lord to develop mental demons. He expelled the mental demons. Now, the mental demons are being
 nurtured. This will be a disaster,” the Chaotic Consciousness said in a low voice. The Formless Transcendent Deity asked in surprise, “What about him? Why didn’t he
 restrain him?”
 The Chaotic Consciousness said, “This time,
 consumed too much. He will fall into a deep sleep. That mental demon is also being nurtured. He entrusted us with it. During his
 sleep, if the mental demon awakens, we have to stop him.”
 it
 The Immeasurable Destruction Venerable said in a low voice, “How’s the mental demon’s
 strength?”
 “To be able to make him fall asleep, I’m afraid… So, we have to work together.” Han Jue didn’t speak and just listened quietly.
 “Can I insta-kill the Ninth Chaos’ mental demon?”
 [50 quadrillion years of lifespan will be
 deducted. Do you want to continue?] Almost half of his main body’s value! Continue!
 [No]
 Han Jue’s heart sank.
 “Then, can the mental demon kill me?”
 [No]
 That was good.
 Han Jue relaxed again.
 With this value, even all these Dao Creators
 “I keep feeling that something is wrong,” the
 Formless Transcendent Deity suddenly said. The Chaotic Consciousness and the Immeasurable Destruction Venerable were
 silent.
 Han Jue also felt that something was wrong.
 How powerful was the Ninth Chaos? How could
 it be forced to such a state by a mental demon? Could it be…
 The Chaotic Consciousness said faintly, “He has his own righteousness. The rules he set for himself helped us, but they also made him fall
 into a dilemma now. Only this method can resolve his problem.”
 Han Jue understood what he meant. Although
 the Ninth Chaos was invincible, it liked to be reasonable and never bullied the juniors. This was also the reason why they could rise. From
 this, it could be seen that the Ninth Chaos had righteousness and principles.
 Now that the Ninth Chaos was threatened by the Dark Forbidden Lord, he felt uneasy. He wanted to eliminate the trouble, but he did not know who the other party was.
 If it was anyone else in his position, they would definitely rather kill everyone by mistake than let them go.
 The Ninth Chaos did not want this to happen,
 matter.
 “There’s no other way. We can only prepare to
 deal with it. This might be our calamity. We have to tell the Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity about this. We have to be united!” the Immeasurable Destruction Venerable said
 coldly. Since they could not escape, why guess? They
 had to face it.
 “Then where is the mental demon?” Han Jue suddenly asked.
 The Chaotic Consciousness said, “It’s the Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil that wreaks havoc
 in the Chaos. The Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil is
 only a shell. The true mental demon is still being nurtured.”
 “What will happen if we kill him directly?”
 “When the mental demon is shattered, his power will impact the Chaos and everything. It’s equivalent to us facing a full-powered
 attack from his main body.
 The Chaotic Consciousness’s words were filled with helplessness.


 “In that case, we can’t touch this mental demon?” Han Jue frowned and asked.
 The Chaotic Consciousness said, “It’s just that we can’t touch him before he awakens. When he awakens and lures him into the blank domain, we’ll join forces to suppress him. Before that, what we have to do is to use the power of all living beings to restrict the mental demon. We’ll prepare a method to suppress or seal him. It’s impossible to kill him.”
 The Formless Transcendent Deity and the Immeasurable Destruction Venerable nodded in agreement.
 Han Jue had no objections. The four Dao Creators agreed immediately.
 They left after the discussion ended.
 Han Jue thought of Primordial Origin and Huang Zuntian again after returning to the Daoist temple of the third Dao Field. He didn’t know for how long Primordial Origin would hide.
 Wow.
 The Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil, Primordial Origin, and the various Dao Creators.
 Han Jue looked at the Nine Divine Stars. He didn’t know if these little fellows could grow up before the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity ended.
 Perhaps their time to shine belonged to the next era.
 Thinking of this, Han Jue closed his eyes and continued cultivating.
 The Ninth Chaos already had the intention to kill the other Dao Creators. What he wanted to do was to break through as soon as possible.
 The Ninth Chaos should only be at the perfected Dao Creator Realm. As long as Han Jue reached this realm, it should be very easy to control the Ninth Chaos.
 This was Han Jue’s cultivation philosophy. It was deeply rooted.
 …
 Transcendent Great Dao World, Creation
 Emperor Court, Heavenly Hall.
 Han Ling sat on the Emperor’s throne. Tens of thousands of leaders of the Court gathered in the hall. The closer they were to Han Ling, the stronger their cultivation.
 Han Ye, Han Yao, and Han Bashen stood at the front. They were already Great Dao Supremes and had proved themselves in tens of millions of years of battle.
 A sage-like old man in a Daoist robe cupped his hands and said, “Your Majesty, the Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil that appeared in the Chaos can control all the evil devils, including those who transcend the Great Dao World. Perhaps the Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil can’t threaten us yet, but they have already fused with the Chaos. Their claws will reach the Creation Emperor Court sooner or later.”
 Han Ye smiled. “Then what should we do? Help the Chaos eliminate the devils? We can’t even eliminate the Transcendent Evil Devils.”
 His words were echoed by the Divine Generals.
 The Creation Emperor Court was divided into two factions: civil and military. The civil faction was in charge of plotting and managing the court’s subordinate forces. The military faction was in charge of fighting. It was very similar to the structure of a mortal empire. The hall fell into an argument about the Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil.
 The Chaos stirred up waves of devil suppression operations, but as the overlord factions returned in failure, the ferocious reputation of the Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil
 began to spread.
 “Why didn’t Zhao Shuangquan of the Nine Extremes Orthodoxy find trouble with the Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil?” Han Ling
 suddenly asked. Her words attracted the attention of all the Emperor Immortals in the
 hall. They were enlightened. Yes, why didn’t Zhao Shuangquan do anything to the evil devils?
 Zhao Shuangquan was said to want to unify the
 Chaos. Why didn’t he make a move since the
 Chaos was in trouble?
 Zhao Shuangquan had been famous for a long time and was arrogant. He was not inferior to
 Han Huang and was naturally not afraid of
 battle.
 Could it be…
 Han Yao asked, “Is this a conspiracy of the
 Chaos?”
 Han Bashen said in a low voice, “Very likely. Otherwise, why would the Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil appear in the Chaos and not other Great Dao Worlds? This is the most difficult path for his development, at least on the surface.”
 The Literature Immortals also changed sides and felt that it was not suitable to reinforce the Chaos.
 Han Ling said, “Let’s not care about the matter
 of the Ultimate Evil and Chaotic Devils for the time being. The waters of the Chaos are very deep. Just these evil devils are not enough to overturn the Chaos. The Creation Emperor Court’s goal is still to consolidate its existing
 domain. The Creation Array has to be set up as soon as possible. It concerns the advancement and retreat of the Creation Emperor Court in the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity.” Tens of thousands of Emperor Immortals
 agreed.
 Han Ling’s words were absolute in the Creation Emperor Court. No one underestimated her because she was a woman. Every Emperor
 Immortal had fought Han Ling before. The difference in strength was too great.
 Just like that, the Creation Emperor Court gave up helping the Chaos.
 It wasn’t only the Creation Emperor Court. The other major factions of the Great Dao World were the same. The situation in the Chaos had
 In the depths of the Chaos, in the Nine Extremes Orthodoxy.
 Countless Dao Fields that emitted light were
 like stars gathering in the sky, decorating this void. Living beings of all races came and went, prosperous and vast.
 In a palace.
 Zhao Shuangquan sat in midair. Three beams
 of light circled around him. They were the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority, symbolizing the power of the Supreme Rules.
 The Nine-Headed Divine Spirit looked up at him.
 grasped the Supreme Rules so easily, as if they were born for him…”
 The Nine-Headed Divine Spirit had mixed emotions. He had always treated himself as the Ninth Chaos’ son, but now he began to suspect
 However, he had no choice. He had failed
 before. Now, he could only follow the Ninth Chaos’ instructions to help Zhao Shuangquan. It had to be said that Zhao Shuangquan’s potential was indeed great. Other than the
 power of Father in his body, there was another powerful force. The Nine-Headed Divine Spirit suddenly
 thought of Yu Yuan. Yu Yuan and Zhao Shuangquan were too similar. They were both taken care of by his father. The difference was that Yu Yuan was born too late.
 When Yu Yuan grew up and joined forces with Zhao Shuangquan, he would definitely be able to dominate the Great Dao Immeasurable
 Calamity.
 The Nine-Headed Divine Spirit began to look
 The current him had already lost control of the Chaos. He hated the other Great Dao Worlds and Great Dao Divine Spirits. Zhao Shuangquan’s voice sounded, “I still need
 more Great Dao Providence Divine Authority.
 Help me find it!”
 The Nine-Headed Divine Spirit’s face twitched. “Alright!”
 With that, he turned around and left. Zhao Shuangquan opened his eyes and watched
 him disappear.
 “Ninth Brother, is this the Chaos? You did well. The rest is up to me,” Zhao Shuangquan muttered to himself, his tone filled with
 absolute confidence.
 …
 More than eight million years later.
 Han Jue was still in seclusion when he was suddenly awakened by a loud sound.
 Boom-
 This loud sound was loud and piercing, shaking
 the soul.
 The Nine Divine Stars and Shan’e were also
 shocked and couldn’t help but look around. “Which direction is it?” “Someone is fighting in the Chaos again?”
 “Look, it’s Zhao Shuangquan and the Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil.”
 “He finally made a move. I thought he was
 afraid.”
 “He wants to unite the Chaos, so he naturally
 has to carry the banner of protecting it.”
 …
 Han Jue’s gaze locked in a direction. Zhao Shuangquan was fighting the Ultimate
 Evil Chaotic Devil. He was secretly surprised.
 Zhao Shuangquan had the power of two Dao
 Creators and four Great Dao Providence Divine Authority powers.
 Most importantly, why did he want to fight the Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil?
 have already awakened the Eighth Chaos’
 memories.
 Interesting?
 Could Zhao Shuangquan kill the Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil?
 Could it be that Zhao Shuangquan wanted to


 Zhao Shuangquan was even stronger than when he fought Han Ling. His aura was almost invincible, far exceeding a Great Dao Supreme. Half-step Dao Creator!
 Han Jue thought of a powerful enemy from before who thought that he had reached the level of a Dao Creator, which was Zhao Shuangquan’s current level.
 The Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil was also very strong. He summoned an endless stream of evil devils to besiege the Nine Extremes Orthodoxy while he fought Zhao Shuangquan alone.
 Han Jue saw the Strange Deity. He mixed among the evil devils and stabbed them in the back. While the evil devils were fighting, he devoured one from time to time.
 The Chaotic War was too vast. All sorts of Mystical Powers destroyed the world. No one discovered the Strange Deity’s actions.
 This fellow…
 How sinister!
 Han Jue felt disdain and suddenly regretted it. Perhaps he shouldn’t have let him out all those years ago.
 He had to throw him into the Ultimate Origin Heavenly Prison when he returned to prevent from being stabbed in the back in the future.
 Soon, Han Jue discovered that Zhao
 Shuangquan really wanted to kill the Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil.
 Why did he still want to kill the Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil after awakening the Eighth Chaos’ memories?
 …
 Han Jue suddenly realized something.
 The Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil’s appearance might not be to deal with the Dao Creators, but to help the Eighth Chaos!
 With Zhao Shuangquan’s potential, it would really take too long for him to grow into a Dao Creator.
 The Endless Era might have already passed by then!
 Before the Ninth Chaos created the Chaos, the strongest cultivation of the first eight Chaos had never reached the Dao Creator Realm.
 Therefore, the Ninth Chaos gave ordinary cultivation to the mental demon. It looked helpless and even dealt with other Dao Creators, but it was actually to nurture Zhao Shuangquan?
 “Is what I’m thinking true?”
 [50 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [Yes]
 As expected.
 Han Jue looked at Zhao Shuangquan coldly.
 This fellow was a junior of the Heavenly Dao and he had a favorable impression of him previously. However, it would not be good if the Eighth Chaos became a Dao Creator.
 Previously, he had calculated that after Nine Chaos revived, they would attack the other Dao Creators.
 They believed that they were the ones who ruled everything and did not allow other existences to be on the same level as them. Unfortunately, the Ninth Chaos didn’t know that Han Jue was about to catch up to him.
 Han Jue didn’t have to do anything. He just had
 to seize the opportunity and break through.
 Then, he closed his eyes and resumed his
 seclusion cycle.
 Shan’e hurriedly left the Daoist temple with the Nine Divine Stars upon seeing that he continued cultivating. They discussed with the disciples of the Dao Field outside excitedly. They were just short of eating melon seeds.
 This battle continued one after another. Zhao Shuangquan and the Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil would erupt every time they were at a disadvantage.
 Han Jue would definitely feel tired if he was watching the battle. However, the Nine Divine Stars were watching with relish, causing their mood to fluctuate.
 The battle ended a million years later.
 Time passed.
 On the other side.
 Inside the Daoist temple.
 [Detected that you are 200 million years old
 and your life has taken another step forward. You have the following choices:]
 [1: Exit seclusion immediately and kill all the other Dao Creators. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment, a Primordial Fragment, a Creation Spirit Stone, and an Ultimate Origin Spirit
 Stone.]
 the system function.] Han Jue’s eyes lit up.
 A chance to upgrade the Dao Field! Something good finally came out after he waited for a hundred million years!
 Han Jue almost forgot that the Dao Field could
 be upgraded.
 It seemed that his recent cultivation had been
 fruitful.
 He immediately chose the second option, and a new notification appeared in front of him. [You chose to cultivate in a low-profile manner and maintain your original intention. You obtained a Great Dao Fragment, a Primordial
 Fragment, a Creation Spirit Stone, an Ultimate Origin Spirit Stone, and a chance to upgrade the Dao Field.]
 [The main Dao Field has begun to upgrade.]
 [The second Dao Field has begun to upgrade.] [The third Dao Field has begun to upgrade.]
 his Dao Companions.
 After a long while…
 The Nine Divine Stars and Shan’e woke up one
 Even if a Great Dao Sage was not top-notch in the Chaos, they would be soon. Shan’e smiled and said, “You can test his power when the progenitor opens the simulation trial to you in the future.”
 A descendant asked curiously, “What’s the simulation trial?”
 Shan’e briefly introduced it to them. The Nine Divine Stars became excited and wished they could immediately open the simulation trial. The Nine Divine Stars looked at Han Jue with burning eyes when he returned.
 Han Jue saw through their thoughts and immediately opened the simulation trial to them.
 Soon, the Nine Divine Stars immersed
 themselves in the simulation trial.
 Han Jue paid attention and discovered that
 these guys all challenged him first. Courting death.
 Han Jue teased them in his heart. He did not interfere. Instead, he returned to
 the lotus throne and started checking his
 emails.
 The emails were not much different from the
 past, but Han Jue read them very slowly.
 He was waiting for the Dao Field to be successfully upgraded. [The Formless Transcendent Deity sent you a dream. Do you accept?]
 Han Jue hesitated for a moment before choosing to accept it.
 The dream was a blank domain. Han Jue’s feelings regarding the Formless Transcendent Deity were still very subtle. After all, this was the Evil Heavenly Emperor’s
 backing.
 “Fellow Daoist Han, may I ask if you are confident in dealing with the Chaos?” The Formless Transcendent Deity went straight to the point. The Chaos he was talking about was naturally the Ninth Chaos.
 “What’s the Nine Chaos?” Han Jue asked in surprise. The Formless Transcendent Deity explained.
 Just like the Nine Great Chaos that Han Jue
 knew, he didn’t even know as much as him.
 “There are eight brothers in the Chaos. If the Chaos revives them, they will purge us. The so-called Endless Era is not prepared for us at all, but for the eight Chaos. The Endless Era is
 only for the existence of more Chaos,” the Formless Transcendent Deity said in a low voice with a solemn tone.
 Han Jue’s expression changed drastically as he muttered, “If that’s the case…”
 “Fellow Daoist Han, I know that you’re very strong and have already surpassed us. I can only tell you this. I don’t believe the other Dao Creators. I’ve been watching your growth. Your attitude towards the people around you makes me very relieved. Instead of letting the other existences be the strongest, I’m willing to let you be the strongest!
 “I’ll help you as long as you have the strength
 to match
 the Chaos!”


 Han Jue was surprised. This fellow wanted to seek refuge with him?
 It was indeed beyond Han Jue’s expectations. In his opinion, it was impossible for a Dao Creator to bow his head unless he was
 He asked in his mind, “Is the Formless Transcendent Deity sincere in seeking refuge with me?”
 [1 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [Yes]
 This surprised Han Jue even more.
 He was sincere.
 Could it be because of the Evil Heavenly Emperor?
 The Formless Transcendent Deity smiled and said, “If you’re not a match, you’ll immediately leave the dream realm, afraid that you’ll be implicated by me. The fact that you’re still acting humble shows your greatest confidence.”
 Han Jue remained silent.
 If not for the fact that the Formless
 Transcendent Deity was sincere, he would definitely attack him.
 He thought about it carefully. There was indeed nothing immoral about the Formless Transcendent Deity’s deeds. He still wanted to sacrifice himself and exchange his life for all Transcendent living beings. This kindness was indeed impressive.
 “What will you do if I promise you?” Han Jue narrowed his eyes and asked calmly.
 Han Jue asked in his mind, “Will the Formless Transcendent Deity tell the other Dao Creators if I agree?”
 [1 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [No]
 Han Jue was relieved. The Dao Creators he mentioned included the Ninth Chaos. It was okay as long as the Formless Transcendent
 Deity didn’t do this.
 “Make your decision. The Chaos looks benevolent, but that’s only if you don’t threaten him. As long as you threaten him, he
 will definitely attack you. In addition, the matter of his mental demon has already caused
 him to change. If we aren’t prepared, we will be doomed sooner or later.”
 The Formless Transcendent Deity spoke again with a helpless tone.
 This kid was good at everything, but he was too cautious. He was even a little too cowardly,
 reaching a level that the Formless Transcendent Deity could not understand.
 Han Jue said, “Alright, but you can’t tell anyone about this, including the Evil Heavenly Emperor. You understand that as long as others know, they will be deduced by the Dao Creators sooner or later.”
 Han Jue was satisfied. “That’s all. Wait for the
 situation to develop for now.”
 “Are you about to break through?”
 “How is that possible?”
 Han Jue shook his head and laughed. Then, he
 removed the dream.
 [Formless Transcendent Deity has a favorable impression of you. Current favorability: 6
 stars]
 Han Jue saw this notification the moment he opened his eyes, making him even more
 satisfied with him.
 Not bad, not bad.
 Very sensible.
 Subduing the Formless Transcendent Deity was
 a good thing for Han Jue, but not a great thing.
 He didn’t feel this was shameful. If it was any
 other Dao Creator, they would definitely not hold back if they could deal with the other Dao Creators.
 At their cultivation realm, morals were already meaningless.
 Mortals’ morals restricted them. They only
 weaker.
 The Ninth Chaos didn’t dare to deal with him because of the Dao Field. Otherwise, the Ninth Chaos would definitely suppress him and make his Ultimate Origin World fuse with the Chaos like the other Great Dao Worlds.
 He could give others a way out, but he couldn’t give them a chance to threaten him. At this moment, the Nine Divine Stars had
 already woken up from the simulation trial. Their expressions were ugly.
 They didn’t even dare to look at Han Jue.
 Shan’e was extremely happy to see their expressions.
 Who asked you to court death!
 Do you know how terrifying the progenitor is
 now? Han Jue didn’t care. He was waiting for the Dao
 Field to upgrade, but it still didn’t finish even after so much time had passed.
 That made sense. After all, the protective array
 formation of the Dao Field had already reached
 the Creator Lord level. Who knew how long it would take to increase it?
 [Not for the time being. The Ultimate Supreme
 Treasure is already the strongest Dharma treasure. Unless you reach the Creator Lord
 Realm and open up a higher realm, you can’t upgrade an Ultimate Supreme Treasure.] Unknowingly, Han Jue had already reached the level of a pioneer.
 Han Jue looked forward to that day even more.
 Then, he closed his eyes and continued cultivating.
 Time passed quickly. The Chaos fell into unprecedented chaos. The Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil also became the nightmare of all living
 were no longer Great Dao Worlds, but separate domains.
 The Chaos was already used to the existence of
 evil devils when Han Jue reached 210 million years old.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and started to check his emails.
 Next, he began the simulation trial.
 He still treated the Immeasurable Destruction
 Venerable as his opponent.
 Several days later, Han Jue left the simulation
 trial and felt bored. “Why isn’t it done yet?”
 Han Jue sighed in his heart. He always thought
 of the Dao Field.
 He stood up and left the Dao Field. Transcendent Domain, Heavenly Court.
 Han Jue came to a palace. This place was as
 beautiful as a painting. Immortal floors and immortal cranes were lined up. As expected of the Heavenly Court.
 Only Han Qing’er was in the palace. She was
 playing with a small and exquisite silver umbrella.
 Han Jue suddenly appeared in front of her,
 scaring her so much that she hurriedly jumped
 away.
 “Father!”
 Han Qing’er was pleasantly surprised to see him. Then, she looked reproachful.
 “You only know how to scare me!” Han Qing’er snorted, but she was still very happy to see her father.
 The father and daughter sat down and started to reminisce.
 Han Jue revealed a loving expression. The little girl from back then had already
 grown up. This feeling was really wonderful.
 Han Jue had always felt that he was not old. It was just that his age increased quickly. “Father, that Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil is too strong. My second brother and fourth don’t have absolute confidence in defeating it even if they join forces. Will you help if the
 Chaos is in trouble?”
 sister
 Facing his daughter’s question, Han Jue smiled
 and said, “What? Your father is in seclusion
 strength.”
 Han Qing’er curled her lips. “I think you no longer care about the Chaos. Have you also established a Great Dao World? Where?” She was very excited at the mention of the Great Dao World.
 Her cultivation level had also reached the Great
 into contact with the Great Dao World. Jiang Jueshi had taught her a lot, but she had never
 been able to do anything.


 “Yes, you’re right.’
 Han Jue smiled, making Han Qing’er feel like she had punched cotton.
 She really wanted to see her father show his Mystical Power. In the past 200 million years, Han Jue had never made a move, so all living beings had long forgotten about him. Only the cultivators of the older generation knew how terrifying the Divine Might Heavenly Sage was. Han Qing’er curled her lips. “I really can’t figure you out. You’re clearly very strong, but you’re afraid that others will know.”
 Jiang Jueshi, Han Tuo, Han Huang, and so on. Among everyone she knew, as long as their potential was outstanding, they wanted to fight for fame.
 Han Jue and Han Qing’er chatted for a few more hours before he left.
 He went to Han Tuo’s Daoist temple next.
 All these years, Han Tuo had kept a low profile and cultivated diligently.
 Seeing Han Jue, Han Tuo was also very excited and hurriedly bowed. Father and son were not as close as father and daughter. This distance was more like a superior and subordinate.
 Han Jue didn’t mind. They chatted for some time.
 Next, Han Jue went to find Han Huang and Han Ling.
 Han Jue sighed in his heart after returning to the Daoist temple.
 Why hadn’t it been successfully upgraded yet?
 Thousands of years later.
 The Dao Field was successfully upgraded.
 [Please give a name to the realm above the
 Creator Lord Realm.]
 Give it a name!
 Wow!
 Han Jue thought for a moment before calling it Ultimate Origin Supreme.
 [The main Dao Field has been successfully
 upgraded.]
 [The second Dao Field has been successfully
 upgraded.]
 [The third Dao Field has been successfully upgraded.]
 [The Dao Field has been upgraded. The array
 formation has been upgraded to the Ultimate Origin Supreme level. It has expanded the
 internal space of the Dao Field.]
 [The space in the various Dao Fields is interconnected.]
 [Dao Field Immortal Qi has increased by ten times. Connate Qi has increased by ten times.]
 [The Dao Field can block all prying eyes.]
 Han Jue was in a good mood as he looked at the series of notifications in front of him.
 At the same time, the Spirit Qi in the third Dao Field began to increase.
 The disciples were shocked to find that the internal space of the Dao Field was expanding again at a very fast speed. They all thought of Han Jue.
 Shan’e and the Nine Divine Stars also felt the
 increase in Spirit Qi and looked at him. Seeing that Han Jue’s eyes were closed and he was calm, they didn’t dare to disturb him. They
 stood
 The Dao Field had been successfully upgraded.
 finally cultivate properly.
 He entered seclusion.
 The increase in Spirit Qi in the three Dao Fields
 lasted for tens of thousands of years. After all, the huge amount of Spirit Qi contained in the Dao Field had already reached a terrifying level. If it increased by ten times, it would be even more unimaginable.
 In the following years, the disciples of the Hundred Peak Immortal River, the second Dao Field, and the third Dao Field discovered that they could actually touch each other. They were
 extremely lucky.
 On a tall mountain.
 Murong Qi, the Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial, the Black Hell Chicken, Han
 Ming, and the other Chaotic Fiendcelestials
 gathered.
 “I estimate that the space in the Dao Field is no longer inferior to the Chaos. It’s
 unimaginable.”
 Murong Qi sighed, causing the Fiendcelestials
 to be shocked.
 It was as big as the Chaos?
 The Black Hell Chicken shouted, “Could our Dao Field be Master’s Great Dao World?” Dao Comprehension Sword’s eyes lit up. “It’s really possible. Otherwise, even if Master isn’t here, those powerful enemies won’t be able to barge in. Didn’t they say that the Great Dao World can be controlled by its master? Therefore, the power of our Dao Field is Master’s power!”
 The Fiendcelestials felt that it made sense.
 They suddenly thought of something.
 How long had this Dao Field existed? Han Jue already had a Dao Field before he
 attained the Dao…
 Gasp- Thinking of one possibility, they were even more respectful towards Han Jue.
 While the disciples were marveling at the Dao
 Field, the Chaos changed again. The Chaotic Assembly began, but in the end, the Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil brought endless evil devils to attack the Ten Absolute City.
 Without Han Jue guarding it, the Ultimate God of Punishment could only lead the Great Dao Divine Spirits to resist the Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil. Fortunately, almost all the mighty figures of the Chaos came. The battle was not one-sided.
 Boom-
 The endless land shattered crazily. Rolling dust waves rose without restraint.
 Ten Absolute City was protected by a huge array formation. Strong light flickered. The evil devils couldn’t break through the array formation no matter how many attacked. An
 extremely majestic figure could be seen ten
 thousand kilometers outside the city. Great Dao divine patterns floated around him, and countless evil auras formed by negative karma
 wrapped around his body.
 Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil! His figure was sinister as if he was wearing
 armor, but one couldn’t spy on his true body.
 His face was revealed as a sinister smile.
 “Is that all you can do? What about Zhao Shuangquan?”
 The Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil laughed wildly.
 Dozens of Divine Punishers attacked. They all unleashed Great Dao Mystical Powers that tore through the dark sky.
 Boom! Boom! Boom… Countless Dharmic powers landed on the
 Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil’s body and were absorbed by it, not causing any damage. A sword light suddenly illuminated the sky. Sword Qi swept out and cut the Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil in half. Countless evil devils along the way were killed.
 A huge hand suddenly stretched out from
 behind the Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil and clenched in the air. The sky and space shattered like torrential rain. The ear-piercing
 sound caused the souls of the living beings in Ten Absolute City to tremble. A Sword Dao River descended from the sky and
 flowed endlessly as Li Daokong appeared, its momentum enough to crush thousands of worlds. The width of the river was immeasurable.
 “Devil, don’t be arrogant!” Li Daokong snorted coldly. His long hair fluttered wildly. Countless sword shadows surged out from the Sword Dao River and
 pressed down on the Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil.
 The Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil was disdainful.
 At this moment, Zhao Shuangquan, Azure Heaven Mystic, Dao Sovereign, Zhao Xuanyuan, the Great Heavenly God King, the
 Universe Sage King, and other mighty figures who had shocked the Chaos appeared around the Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil and instantly
 cast spells.
 Formation!
 The three thousand Great Dao of the Chaos
 trembled. The power of the three thousand Great Dao descended and shattered the wall of the sky at the bottom of the Chaos, suppressing the Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil at an extremely
 fast speed. Caught off-guard, the Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil knelt on the shattered ground. “Hahaha! You still dare to be arrogant? I can’t
 allow anyone to be more arrogant than me in the Chaos!”
 Azure Heaven Mystic laughed. A divine spear appeared in his hand. It wrapped around the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority and pierced through the Evil Chaotic Devil’s chest.
 Chaotic Devil.
 At this moment, the Ultimate Evil Chaotic
 Devil’s strange sneer suddenly exploded and vanished.
 Immediately after, terrifying auras arrived, startling the experts so much that they turned
 around. They saw countless evil devils appear in all directions. All of them had majestic figures as they came from the end of the ground.
 “How can this be?!”
 “This is a clone?”
 “No, his aura is still so terrifying!”
 “Let me test it!” “Be careful, something’s wrong!” The arrival of countless evil devils terrified the
 people of Ten Absolute City. They saw all the
 Zhao Shuangquan frowned and muttered, “What power is this?”
 He clutched his chest and felt that the power in
 his body was about to break out. This feeling
 The reason for all of this was that Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil!
