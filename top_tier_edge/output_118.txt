 “You will regret challenging me.”
 Han Huang looked down at Emperor Chen Ni expressionlessly. His tone was indifferent and emotionless. It exuded absolute dominance, not caring about the least bit about the other party.
 Emperor Chen Ni smiled. “I’m indeed not your match, but I also want to know my limits. In any case, you Dao Creators can’t kill me!”
 With that, he suddenly raised his sword and slashed. The bone sword emitted a cold light. In an instant, the void around Han Huang froze, producing countless cracks, as if was torn apart.
 !!
 space
 Han Huang’s eyes narrowed. The surrounding space instantly shattered and terrifying purple Divine Punishment Light Blades appeared around him.
 Ultimate Origin Soul Oblivion!
 To be precise, it was the Primordial Divine Oblivion!
 There were seven of them, each emitting a terrifying aura that shook time. Emperor Chen Ni was moved.
 Surpassing speed!
 Emperor Chen Ni was about to raise his sword when purple light interwove. His body was slashed into pieces, and even his soul was slashed into countless thin threads.
 Instant kill!
 In front of Han Huang, Emperor Chen Ni was still too weak because he was only a Great Dao Supreme.
 The difference between a Dao Creator and a Great Dao Supreme was like a chasm.
 In the third Dao Field.
 Han Yunjin cheered when Han Huang killed Emperor Chen Ni.
 Li Yao frowned.
 Xing Hongxuan’s expression was calm.
 Dao Comprehension Sword was speechless. “He died just like that? Weren’t those Dao Creators unable to do anything to him?”
 Han Yunjin sighed. Among his brothers, his second brother was still the most powerful.
 The situation suddenly changed.
 Emperor Chen Ni had actually revived.
 After his body recovered, he was surrounded by seven Primordial Divine Oblivions. He looked up at Han Huang and gritted his teeth. “What do you mean?”
 The corners of Han Huang’s mouth curled up as he said proudly, “It’s a pity to kill you now. It’s a good opportunity to let the current Great Dao Supremes see if they’re worthy of resisting the Dao Creators. I only need a thought to kill you.”
 His figure gradually disappeared. The seven Primordial Divine Oblivions surrounding Emperor Chen Ni also vanished.
 Emperor Chen Ni did not heave a sigh of relief.
 Instead, his expression was extremely ugly.
 He could feel many gazes staring at him. At this moment, many enemies were probably laughing at him.
 “How can this be… Even the Chaotic Consciousness can’t kill me. Why can he? The Chaotic Consciousness is older than him. How can it be inferior to him?”
 Emperor Chen Ni clenched his fists in
 frustration.
 He was defeated before he could even use his
 Mystical Powers.
 He tried his best to calm down and left.
 This originally world-shattering battle ended quickly. Han Huang, who had already faded
 from the vision of all living beings, displayed
 his terror again.
 Many mighty figures told their disciples about
 Han Huang back then. He was even more arrogant than the current Emperor Chen Ni.
 Han Huang was a Fiendcelestial before he
 became a Dao Creator!
 …
 Han Yunjin laughed. “Hahaha. Mother, do you
 see his expression? He also looked down on us
 when he descended into the Heavenly Dao. He must feel terrible now that he’s being treated
 like this by Second Brother.”
 Qingluan’er covered her mouth and laughed. “Even if you don’t appear, it’s impossible to mess up this Endless Era. Huang’er and Ling’er have already grown up. Even the Ultimate Origin World is about to give birth to a Dao
 Creator. You don’t have to care about these
 things.”
 Everyone nodded. That made sense.
 Xing Hongxuan stood up and smiled. “I’ll go
 find him. He’s been in seclusion for so long. It’s time for him to show himself.” All the women looked at her expectantly. They
 also wanted to see Han Jue, but they had too many concerns, unlike Xing Hongxuan who could do whatever she wanted.
 Han Yunjin was about to leave when he suddenly changed his mind. He also wanted to see his father.
 Xing Hongxuan came to Han Jue’s Daoist temple and gently opened the door.
 After she entered the temple, she saw Han Jue twisting his waist and neck in his iconic
 actions. The actions were very simple, but it was quite mysterious when he did them. “You’re indeed awake. I felt it just now.” Xing Hongxuan walked over with a smiled.
 Han Jue glanced at her and smiled. “Looks like
 you already have a certain understanding of the power I gave you.”
 Xing Hongxuan said proudly, “Of course. Why
 don’t you take a look at who’s the most trusted deity in the current Endless Era? In the hearts of all living beings, my status is higher than
 yours!”
 Han Jue sized her up for a while and nodded in satisfaction.
 He did not expect her to really walk a
 The path of faith!
 in some small worlds, but the upper limit of their growth was too low. It was very difficult for them to surpass the Immortal Emperor
 Realm.
 Although Xing Hongxuan was not a Dao Creator, her Dharmic powers had already far exceeded those of a Great Dao Supreme. In
 addition to the power given by Han Jue, she wouldn’t lose even if she faced a Dao Creator.
 “By the way, what do you think of that
 Emperor Chen Ni? He’s only a Great Dao Supreme, but he’s already so heaven-defying. He will definitely cause a calamity when he
 basic rules the moment he was born. This meant that a new terrifying race would appear in the blank domain. Just like how the Primordial Chaos was created and the Primordial Fiendcelestial appeared, the Chaos was created and Chaotic Fiendcelestials appeared. In the Endless Era, there were also
 era.
 Han Jue felt that the white-haired man must be one of the Endless Fiendcelestials. Xing Hongxuan said in a low voice, “Actually,
 he’s quite pitiful. Because of his extraordinary potential, he was raised as a pet by a Freedom Sage from the moment he was born. He couldn’t be free. Later, he finally escaped and was suppressed by a Great Dao Sage. potential is too strong, so strong that many
 His
 people are jealous. This encounter led to the him of today.”
 Han Jue said, “So should we kill him or not?”
 Xing Hongxuan asked, “Can we let him start again?” Restart through reincarnation! Just like Primordial Despair Chu Xiaoqi.
 Han Jue reached out and pinched her face. He smiled and said, “I’ll do as you say.” On the other side. Emperor Chen Ni, who was traveling through the pale void, suddenly stopped. He looked at his hands in horror and saw them turn into
 dust at a speed visible to the naked eye. His Dharmic powers and vitality quickly decreased. “What’s happening? Didn’t he let me go? Could
 he be putting on a show?”
 Emperor Chen Ni felt fear and hurriedly mobilized his Dharmic powers to protect his soul, but it was useless. He couldn’t move. An unknown fear enveloped Emperor Chen Ni’s
 heart. What force was restraining him?


 In fear, Emperor Chen Ni’s body and soul were destroyed. Only a wisp of his will fell into the cycle of reincarnation in the Ultimate Origin World. No one sensed this. Only Han Jue knew. The mighty figures realized that something was wrong only countless years later. The insufferably arrogant Emperor Chen Ni had disappeared after losing to Han Huang!
 Han Jue didn’t enter seclusion immediately. Instead, he went to visit his Dao Companions and walked around the Dao Field.
 The three Dao Fields were connected internally. It was already a vast world. After twenty billion years of accumulation, there were many ascetic disciples in the Dao Field. They were quietly cultivating everywhere.
 Han Jue treated it as a sightseeing trip. It was not especially ostentatious.
 !!
 Some disciples who brushed past him did not recognize him. After all, most of the disciples who could stay in the Hidden Sect were already mighty figures. Even if they had never seen him and could not see through him, it was normal.
 Who would have thought that the Supreme Lord would actually wander openly in the Dao Field?
 Han Jue was in a good mood. He checked the disciples’ cultivations as he walked.
 Most of the disciples in the Dao Field were Primordial Chaos Sages. One could almost not see the cultivation realm below the Sages, but there were very few Great Dao Sages. After all, the Great Dao Sage Realm was the limit that most living beings could reach.
 After wandering around, Han Jue slowly returned to his Daoist temple.
 Only a few people knew about his awakening. To the Endless Era, the Lord was still an
 illusory legend.
 When Han Jue closed his eyes, the River of
 Time began to flow faster and faster. It flowed endlessly without going back.
 In the blank domain.
 Purple and crimson lightning appeared in the
 pale space. They interwove in the void and increased in size, forming an endless lightning prison.
 An unknown period of time passed.
 The thunder egg was already larger than many Great Dao Worlds.
 A figure suddenly appeared. It was the Ninth Chaos.
 When the lightning was about to touch him, it automatically circled around, preventing him from being affected by the lightning.
 “This aura…” the Ninth Chaos muttered to himself, his voice trembling slightly.
 Other figures appeared beside him at this moment. They were the Formless
 Transcendent Deity, Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction Venerable, the Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity, the Chaotic Consciousness, Han Huang, Huang Zuntian, Primordial Origin, the Dao Ancestor, Li Yao, Han Ling, Pangu, the Primordial Ancestor God, the Holy Mother of Order, Dugu Wu, and the Life Fiendcelestial.
 They were all Dao Creators!
 “What’s that?” The Holy Mother of Order frowned and asked.
 The Chaotic Consciousness sighed. “This reminds me of when Pangu was born.”
 The gazes of the Dao Creators landed on Pangu. He was burly and his perfect body seemed to be representative of strength. With disheveled hair, he was even more stable than before.
 Pangu did not reply.
 The Ninth Chaos added, “That’s right. It’s indeed the same as Pangu and me. This means that the true era is about to arrive. Things will change all order and even change the essence of the blank domain. To all existences in the Endless Era, including us, it’s a calamity.
 “This is the fixed number of blank domains. Every long period of time or stage.” His words made the Dao Creators uneasy.
 The Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity said in a low voice, “Then we can’t wait for death. Kill
 him!”
 Several Dao Creators agreed, but some felt that they still had to wait and see.
 The Life Fiendcelestial said, “It’s not so easy to destroy him. My consciousness can’t
 backlash.”
 Primordial Origin suddenly waved his palm, and countless bolts of lightning dispersed. The Primordial Purple Qi transformed into a
 terrifying pillar of light that collided with the mysterious thunder egg. However, something that moved the Dao Creators happened. The
 thunder egg actually absorbed Primordial Origin’s Dharmic powers.
 The other Dao Creators attacked one after another, but they discovered that no matter how they attacked, they could not destroy the thunder egg. Their Dharmic powers were even absorbed.
 The thunder egg’s aura even increased greatly.
 The Dao Creators were silent. Panic rose in
 their hearts.
 What should they do?
 “We can only find the Lord,” the Dao Ancestor
 said. The Dao Creators looked at Li Yao. Only she had the closest relationship with the Lord. Li Yao said, “His seclusion period now is as
 it.”
 The Dao Ancestor felt that it made sense and
 nodded slightly.
 The Formless Transcendent Deity said, “I will
 The Dao Creators nodded and dispersed. The Ninth Chaos returned to the tree and sat in
 front of the chessboard in deep thought. A figure descended from the sky and landed
 beside him. It was the will of the First Chaos. The First Chaos asked, “What happened?” The Ninth Chaos said, “An unknown force has appeared. Previously, Emperor Chen Ni had already stirred up the Endless Era. After he mysteriously disappeared, even more terrifying danger appeared. I suspect that this egg might be the white-haired man I dreamed of.” The First Chaos said, “Let the Lord investigate
 this matter.”
 “The fact that he can persist in cultivation
 means that his potential far exceeds our imagination. Only by constantly improving can
 he persist,” the Ninth Chaos said calmly. The First Chaos nodded. Silence returned to the tree.
 The First Chaos did not disturb him. He turned
 around and entered a leaf, entering the world hanging above.
 …
 In the third Dao Field.
 Han Jue, who was meditating, slowly opened
 his eyes. Unknowingly, he was already 30 billion years old.
 He had been in seclusion for another ten billion
 years. He did not feel that it had been long. He even felt that it had been shorter than when he had traveled the world.
 had even entered the depths of the blank
 domain.
 There was a mysterious barrier there. It was
 invisible and colorless, but it really existed.
 Even the power of the Lord could not penetrate
 it.
 He grew interested in the birth of the blank domain.
 Did the blank domain exist, to begin with, or did it transform from something?
 Perhaps the void itself was the lowest level of everything.
 Han Jue stopped thinking about it.
 He looked at the extremely huge thunder egg in the depths of the blank domain. Unlike the Dao Creators, his gaze could directly see through the thing inside the thunder egg. It was a huge fetus that looked like a human
 and a demon. Its body was surrounded by basic rules.
 Indeed, the blank domain would constantly


 “First, there was Han Liang, then the Endless Fiendcelestial, and now this fellow. It seems that the blank domain sensed my threat and is thinking of a way to devour me.”
 Han Jue thought silently. The current Ultimate Origin World had expanded countless times. It was already endless to a Freedom Sage. Only a Great Dao Sage could jump out, but it would also take a long time.
 The Ultimate Origin World was not only as big as it looked but also the improvement of the rules of space. For example, a Great Dao Sage couldn’t jump out with a thought. This obstacle was equivalent to Han Jue facing a blank
 domain, and he couldn’t jump out just because he wanted to.
 !!
 The expansion of the Great Dao World was never visible to the naked eye.
 Han Jue stood up and disappeared.
 He came in front of the mysterious thunder egg. In an instant, the various bolts of lightning in the void instantly stopped. Even the light that surged towards the thunder egg stopped.
 The Formless Transcendent Deity appeared beside him and bowed respectfully.
 His cultivation level had been increasing ever since he grasped the power of the Endless Era. However, facing Han Jue, he inexplicably felt that the difference between them was
 “Master, what should we do with this?” the Formless Transcendent Deity asked respectfully.
 Han Jue said, “I’ll take him away and discipline him well.”
 The Formless Transcendent Deity asked in surprise, “You can take him away?”
 Han Jue waved his hand. The extremely huge thunder egg quickly shrank and landed in his palm.
 The Formless Transcendent Deity was shocked. Previously, so many Dao Creators had joined forces, but they had not shaken this egg. But the Lord had casually put it away.
 Han Jue clenched his right hand and the thunder egg disappeared.
 At this moment, the stagnant lightning struck Han Jue. His eyes turned cold. All the lightning dissipated and the surrounding space distorted violently.
 The Formless Transcendent Deity felt a terrifying power. This power was extremely
 terrifying, but he could not capture where this power came from. It was definitely not from the Lord.
 The Rule Power of the blank domain?
 The Formless Transcendent Deity was shocked.
 The Lord could already ignore the rules of the blank domain?
 Han Jue smiled at the Formless Transcendent Deity and said, “My cultivation level has increased a little. It didn’t disappoint me.”
 The Formless Transcendent Deity was
 flattered.
 Han Jue disappeared.
 The Formless Transcendent Deity sighed and
 left.
 …
 Back in the third Dao Field.
 Han Jue threw the thunder egg into the
 Ultimate Origin Heavenly Prison. The thunder egg floated in the middle corner like a black
 hole.
 The Origin Divine Millet suddenly appeared from the wall and approached the thunder egg
 to observe.
 The Origin Divine Millet was formed by the Origin Space-time. Ever since it was subdued by Han Jue, it had been wandering around the Dao Field. The disciples knew of its existence and determined it to be a divine beast of the
 Dao Field.
 Han Jue smiled and said, “Don’t touch it. You’ll
 be injured.”
 The snake head of the Origin Divine Millet quickly nodded. Then, it circled a few times
 and left.
 Han Jue took the time to look at the blank
 domain.
 After twenty billion years, the Endless Era had
 Now, there were already fifteen Dao Creators, and this was even when the three Primordial Fiendcelestials were counted as one.
 rarely encountered a huge calamity and had
 less understanding of fate. Chu Xiaoqi had participated in the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity in his previous life, but the negative karma of Primordial Despair was a burden, causing his Great Dao World to be unstable.
 Negative karma storms would occasionally appear and wreak havoc.
 Han Jue no longer had any special feelings for them. He no longer cared if they could successfully attain the Dao.
 The current Han Jue only wanted to surpass
 the Creator Lord Realm quickly.
 In the future, existences more outstanding than the thunder egg would definitely appear. He couldn’t relax in his cultivation.
 Creator Lord, Han Jue’s strength was already
 Lord Realm didn’t have a minor realm at all. It
 was probably the same for the realms above. Ultimate Origin Supreme was Han Jue’s definition of the realm above the Creator Lord.
 He had two hypotheses. One was that the Ultimate Origin World could replace the blank
 Second, break through in advance!
 The way to break through was only possible through increasing one’s potential. Currently, Han Jue only had one Ultimate
 Origin Fragment and fifteen Primordial Fragments. Nine Ultimate Origin Fragments
 years. It still required an extremely long time to rely on the Ultimate Origin Great Creation. He decided to walk his own path. He did not have to rely on the system!
 The system was formed by the Creation Will of
 the blank domain. Countless previous owners had accumulated creation to be where they
 were today.
 He began to think about how the Creation Will
 became stronger.
 The system’s explanation was that the stronger he was, the stronger the system was. However, the system was always above him.
 It seemed that the reason was still above the basic rules of the blank domain. Without him moving, how could the system absorb the power of basic rules?
 Karma, faith, providence…
 Invisible and untouchable powers existed in
 the unseen world.
 Could it be that the system was absorbing his providence, faith, and karma?
 Could the basic rules of the blank domain also
 have such a thing?
 Han Jue fell into deep thought. His will entered
CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m the space of the blank domain and faced the
 basic rules.
 What greeted his eyes were colorful Rule Lights of different forms and speeds. The number reached a level that even he, the Creator Lord, could not estimate.
 Everything around him was flowing at high
 speed. Han Jue began to search for special basic rules.
 He might not have been able to do it in the
 past, but he might be able to find it now that he was much stronger.
 When Han Jue was immersed in the basic rules, on the surface of the blank domain.
 A Sword Dao River swept through the pale void.
 Li Daokong stood on the waves with his hands behind his waist.
 “Kid, you can’t escape anymore. Give up,” Li Daokong said expressionlessly. Following his gaze, a figure was faintly discernible ahead. It was very fast.
 Soon, the figure stopped and revealed its true body. It was a white-haired man. It was Emperor Chen Ni’s reincarnation. After ten billion years, Emperor Chen Ni rose
 again as a living being of the Ultimate Origin World. However, he did not have memories of his previous life and only relied on his nature. In this life, he was still called Emperor Chen Ni. Chen Ni was his name. It entered the depths of his soul and could not be erased. “Endless God, what are you doing!” Emperor Chen Ni said angrily, his tone uneasy. The Sword Dao River surged over. Li Daokong
 Emperor Chen Ni laughed in anger. “Could it be that the Ultimate Origin World has never devoured other Great Dao Worlds? I’m just helping the Lord!”


 “How impudent. Do you think the Lord needs your help?” Li Daokong frowned and shouted coldly. A terrifying pressure descended, immobilizing Emperor Chen Ni.
 Although the Endless Gods were not Dao Creators, with the enhancement of the power of the Lord, the Dao Creator could not kill him, so he was equivalent to a Dao Creator!
 Emperor Chen Ni said angrily, “Mind your own business. Kill me if you have the guts!”
 Boom-
 !!
 He erupted with his full aura and actually dispersed Li Daokong’s aura. He punched at him. This punch instantly darkened the void. The power of space drowned the Sword Dao River like a storm. Li Daokong’s body distorted like a mirror shattering.
 Swish!
 Emperor Chen Ni sensed something and suddenly looked up. He saw an indescribably big sword of light descending from above. He couldn’t dodge in time and was killed.
 The sword of light exploded and countless spots of light scattered. Then, they
 transformed into countless sword shadows that dotted the dark void. Just as Emperor Chen Ni condensed his body, he was locked down by the light emitted by the sword shadows and could
 not move.
 “What power is this?”
 Emperor Chen Ni was moved. He immediately mobilized the power of his Great Dao World and a world Dharma idol appeared around him. He wanted to disperse the surrounding sword shadows and light, but he was cut into countless pieces.
 These lights were not light, but a power of rules!
 Li Daokong looked down at Emperor Chen Ni coldly and said, “This is the power of the gods. Seeing that it’s not easy for you to cultivate, you will be suppressed in the Void Prison. Repent!”
 With that, all the sword shadows suddenly shrank and drowned Emperor Chen Ni.
 The insufferably arrogant Emperor Chen Ni was easily suppressed again. The huge ball of light descended rapidly and broke through the dark void. Emperor Chen Ni’s roar lasted for a long time.
 Li Daokong looked down at him until he disappeared.
 “What’s the Lord’s attitude towards him?” Li
 Daokong thought in confusion. Ten billion. years ago, Emperor Chen Ni almost caused a calamity for the Endless Era. After disappearing for billions of years, he had actually
 reincarnated in the Ultimate Origin World. It was very difficult to not suspect that this was the Lord’s arrangement.
 It was precisely because of this that Li Daokong did not dare to rashly kill Emperor Chen Ni.
 If not for this Divine Authority, he really did not know how to spend the rest of his life.
 …
 In a mysterious palace.
 Han Liang was meditating and cultivating. The
 current him was no longer the simple youth from back then. His aura was stronger than
 most Great Dao Supremes.
 He asked, “Why can’t the seventh Supreme Rule be condensed? Chu Xiaoqi’s seventh Supreme Rule has already taken form. Do you want to lose to him?”
 He was very unhappy. Although Chu Xiaoqi had the three Primordial Fiendcelestials behind him, Han Liang was not bad either. He had the Chaotic Consciousness behind him. How could he lose to Chu Xiaoqi?
 Han Liang opened his eyes and said with an ugly expression, “I feel that something is missing. I can’t say why.”
 He was also very depressed and frustrated.
 This sense of powerlessness had been born for billions of years, making him feel very bad. Especially when Chu Xiaoqi overtook him, his Dao heart became even more unstable. Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction Venerable said, “Go find the Lord. Perhaps he can guide you. We’re only Dao Creators. We’ve already taught you everything we know.”
 Han Liang hesitated. “Grandpa has been in seclusion for 20 billion years and has never appeared. Can I rashly disturb him?”
 “Of course not. Just kneel in front of his Daoist
 temple and wait sincerely. After all, you grew up beside him. He shouldn’t ignore you. Try
 your best. We’ll think of another way if he doesn’t receive you,” Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction Venerable said in a low voice.
 Han Liang was silent.
 Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction Venerable did not disturb him and disappeared.
 Han Liang struggled for a long time. He didn’t
 dare to look for Han Jue mainly because he felt a little embarrassed.
 He knew that his starting point was very high. He, who had been doted on since he was young, had an advantage over all living beings,
 After struggling for a long time, Han Liang sighed and stood up.
 He really had no choice but to ask his
 grandfather for help.
 …
 Han Jue’s consciousness was immersed in
 exploring the basic rules. The surrounding rules flowed extremely quickly, which meant
 that time in the outside world also passed very quickly.
 Back then, when Han Jue became a Creator Lord, the Endless Era had passed, so he had to reverse everything and start over.
 He was not worried. In any case, he wouldn’t consume the Origin Space-time here.
 As he captured the special basic rules, his understanding of them immediately became much clearer. He could even think freely and not follow the basic rules.
 What was the Creator Lord and the Ultimate Origin Supreme?
 The Lord ruled everything. Then how should he define the Supreme?
 Han Jue felt that everything was a blank domain. The Supreme was naturally above it. He would be considered the Ultimate Origin
 Supreme when he could jump out of the blank domain. As for the Ultimate Origin World replacing the blank domain, it was actually not
 from now?
 The only difference might be that he would have greater control over everything. But that was not Han Jue’s goal. He didn’t have much need to control everything. He wanted to pursue pure strength more.
 Han Jue noticed a special basic rule. It was
 purple, like the Primordial Purple Qi flashed past. He quickly caught up to it.
 It was very fast. A Dao Creator might not be
 able to catch up, but Han Jue easily followed it.
 He took a closer look. This purple rule was
 extremely cold. Even he, the Lord, trembled. “What is this?”
 His consciousness collided.
 In an instant, the entire blank domain
 suddenly turned purple. Everything happened too quickly, preventing all living beings from
 reacting.
 The Dao Creators were the first to gather in the Transcendent Divine Hall to discuss this
 matter.
 “What’s happening?”
 “Previously, there was that thunder egg. Now,
 there’s a spatial change.”
 “I’m not sure. I can’t sense it. There’s no special aura, either.”
 “The rules are stable.”
 The Dao Creators discussed. At the same time, Han Liang, who was kneeling
 in front of Han Jue’s Dao Field, suddenly looked up. His gaze passed through this world and saw the change in the blank domain. For some reason, his heart began to beat faster. “My blood…”
 Han Liang touched his body as his expression changed. He could feel a powerful force boiling in his blood and gradually fusing into his soul.


 Han Liang began to tremble as his body gradually condensed.
 At this moment, Xing Hongxuan and Li Yao appeared on both sides of him. They wanted to help Han Liang, but they were pushed away by a powerful force.
 The two women were shocked.
 The women couldn’t help Han Liang. They could only watch as he transformed from an adult to a youth, then a child, and finally shrank into a baby. Most importantly, he was still shrinking.
 They panicked.
 Xing Hongxuan immediately turned around and wanted to enter Han Jue’s Daoist temple, but she couldn’t open the door.
 She seemed to have thought of something and calmed down.
 The others were the same.
 They all felt that Han Liang’s change might be related to Han Jue. Usually, Han Jue wouldn’t especially block the Dao Field and prevent Xing Hongxuan from entering. Something must have happened.
 With him around, they didn’t have to be afraid even if the sky collapsed!
 Soon, Han Liang shrank into a purple ball of light and began to rise. He jumped out of the Dao Field and arrived in the purple void, constantly rising.
 In the purple ball of light, Han Liang’s consciousness was still there. He could no longer control himself and could only see himself constantly rising.
 “What happened?”
 Han Liang was terrified, but there was nothing he could do.
 The Chaotic Consciousness and Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction Venerable appeared. Han Liang felt relieved upon seeing them.
 However, the two Dao Creators raised their hands to grab it, but the purple ball of light pierced through their palms and injured them.
 “What power is this?” Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction Venerable asked in disbelief.
 The Chaotic Consciousness did not answer
 because he did not know, either.
 The purple ball of light suddenly vanished
 without a trace.
 In an instant, the two Dao Creators were stunned.
 The Chaotic Consciousness asked, “Why are we here?”
 Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction Venerable said in surprise, “I’m not sure, either. Could it be caused by this phenomenon?”
 The two Dao Creators left.
 They were puzzled, as if they had forgotten something. How could they have forgotten something with their cultivation levels?
 …
 Han Liang regained consciousness and discovered that he was floating in the mortal world. He couldn’t move or make a sound. He could only watch as the scene in front of him changed. He saw people, worlds, and Great Dao Worlds.
 He even saw some familiar faces, but no one noticed him.
 He was like a spectator outside everything or a
 dream that he could not control.
 This dream was extremely long.
 A year
 Ten thousand years.
 A hundred million years.
 A billion years.
 Han Liang felt despair, anger, and pain. In the
 end, he became numb.
 Creator. All the Dao Creators went to congratulate him, but no one mentioned Han
 Liang.
 Even his parents did not mention him again.
 In the years his consciousness floated, no living being mentioned him.
 It was as if he had never existed. This feeling made him collapse the most.
 He did not understand what had happened to
 him.
 Later, he saw a figure use his supreme Dharmic powers to slaughter Great Dao Worlds. The true calamity of the Endless Era had arrived.
 Han Liang was still numb because no matter what happened, it had nothing to do with him.
 “Why did I encounter such a situation…
 “How much longer is this going to last… “Where is my home…”
 Han Liang thought sadly as his consciousness
 began to sink.
 He saw a white-haired man kill his second
 uncle Han Huang, but it still did not attract his
 attention.
 He kept falling and sinking. After an unknown period of time, Han Liang arrived at an unknown domain. There were all sorts of fast-moving lights in all directions. He was finally curious. What was this place?
 He was a Great Dao Supreme, after all, and he
 had been to countless places, but he had never seen such a place. The movement speed of the light here was too fast, so fast that even he found it dazzling.
 He regained consciousness after adapting for a long time.
 He still could not move.
 He also lost interest in this mysterious domain.
 He wanted to sleep. At least in his dreams, he could weave his world, but he was furious to find that he was unable to sleep.
 It was another endless mental torture.
 Time passed.
 It was so long that Han Liang forgot the time.
 His consciousness had already fallen into an indescribable void. He did not think and was
 numb, but he was still there.
 Suddenly!
 Han Liang was stunned.
 He seemed to have seen a figure flash past.
 How could there be anyone here?
 Han Liang felt bitter, thinking that he was
 hallucinating.
 Then, he was pleasantly surprised. He could
 still hallucinate!
 Was he still far from entering the dream?
 A figure suddenly appeared in front of his consciousness. He was stunned.
 He saw an unfamiliar and familiar face.
 That was… Grandpa!
 Han Liang was overjoyed and in disbelief.
 If anyone in the world could find him, it could
 Han Jue stared at him and suddenly smiled.
 Han Liang suddenly wanted to cry upon seeing his smile.
 The two of them were clearly facing each other,
 but it felt like they would never meet. This loneliness made Han Liang even more afraid. He was afraid that even his grandfather could not save him.
 He saw Han Jue reach out his right hand to
 touch him. He was both expectant and nervous.
 Suddenly, he saw Han Jue’s hand disappear. He felt someone touching his head.
 The feeling of being touched was extremely unfamiliar because he only had consciousness and not a body.
 Han Liang was stunned.
 Han Jue pulled him out, and a familiar voice
 floated over, “Brat, why are you here?” Han Liang stared at his grandfather in a daze
 until he patted his face. He suddenly woke up and hugged him.
 “Grandpa!” Han Liang shouted excitedly with a sobbing tone.
 Before Han Jue could answer, he suddenly realized something and suddenly retreated. He
 was pleasantly surprised to find that he had a
 body.
 He could move now!
 Impossible!
 Han Liang trembled, afraid that this was a
