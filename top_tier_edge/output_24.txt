 They wanted to bring the flower spirit girl in. According to their introduction, this woman was a demon born in the Holy Mother Sect. Because she was likable, they brought her along
 Han Jue could only turn a blind eye and move the girl into the Hundred Peak Immortal River. After all, Xuan Qingjun and Li Yao were his women. He had to treat them differently. Han Jue could sense that the flower girl was formed by a natural treasure. She was different from ordinary living beings and had a special Heavenly Dao providence.
 However, such potential was no longer worthy of his attention.
 Han Jue started to check his emails.
 (Your son Han Tuo has obtained the inheritance of a mysterious mighty figure. His cultivation has increased greatly.)
 (Your good friend Evil Heavenly Emperor has received guidance from a mysterious mighty figure. His cultivation has increased greatly.]
  (Your grand-disciple Chu Shiren was attacked by a mysterious cultivator] x692
 (Your good friend Huang Zuntian has left the Heavenly Dao.]
 (Your disciple Su Qi controls the Six Paths of Reincarnation and is half a step into the Sage Realm.]
 (Your good friend Heavenly Calamity Emperor encountered a mysterious mighty figure in her dream. Her soul was injured.)
 [Your good friend Ancestor Xitian has transcended from the cycle of reincarnation.)
 (Your good friend Empress Houtu was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure and was severely injured.]
 (Your disciple Dao Sovereign was attacked by a mysterious Dao Devil) x6609721
 [Your disciple Zhao Xuanyuan…]
 The mysterious mighty figure Han Tuo and the Evil Heavenly Emperor encountered should be the same person. It was probably the Great Dao Concealment Fiendcelestial.
 The Great Dao Concealment Fiendcelestial was very well-behaved and didn’t have any hatred toward Han Jue. He wasn’t an enemy for the time being.
 Something had actually happened to Heavenly Calamity Emperor. He had to care about it later.
 Speaking of which, the reason why Su Qi cultivated so quickly was that he had received a lot of help from the Heavenly Calamity Emperor. After all, the Heavenly Calamity Emperor also respected him now.
 When Han Jue saw what happened to Ancestor Xitian, he couldn’t help but sigh.
 The ancestor was still the ancestor.
 He had fought his way out.
 Ancestor Xitian was also a protagonist. He was once the ceiling of the Heavenly Dao. How could he die so easily?
 As for the subsequent emails, Han Jue ignored them.
 After reading the emails, he immediately sent a dream to the Heavenly Calamity Emperor.
 After the Heavenly Calamity Emperor opened her eyes, her first reaction was vigilance.
 Han Jue asked, “Who injured you previously?”
 With that said, the Heavenly Calamity Emperor heaved a sigh of relief.
 She said respectfully, “I’m not sure, either. He claimed to be called Life and wanted to incite me to start a rebellion. I rejected him and injured my soul.
 “I thought you were him just now, so…”
 Life?
 Han Jue first thought of Han Ming[1], but ever since this kid was thrown into the second Dao Field by him, he had been very obedient and didn’t leave.
 Han Jue said, “You did well. I’ll preach the Dao for you and help your cultivation increase. Try to reach the Freedom Realm as soon as possible.”
 Heavenly Calamity Emperor had always been stuck at the perfected Primordial Chaos Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm. It was probably very difficult for her to break through on her own.
 Hearing this, Heavenly Calamity Emperor was pleasantly surprised and hurriedly knelt down to thank him.
 Han Jue didn’t say anything else and directly preached the Dao.
 A hundred years later.
 Han Jue opened his eyes.
 “I want to know who the Life that Heavenly Calamity Emperor mentioned is?” Han Jue asked in his mind.
  (Unable to deduce. There is no such entity as Life in the karma tainted by Heavenly Calamity Emperor.]
 Han Jue showed a frown.
 There was no such person?
 Could it be that the other party was not called Life?
 It seemed that he was afraid of being targeted by the Dark Forbidden Lord.
 At least, it meant that this Life had guessed that the Dark Forbidden Lord was in the Heavenly Dao.
 Could it be the Curse Fiendcelestial?
 Han Jue checked his interpersonal relationships. The portrait of the Curse Fiendcelestial was still there, and the name Life didn’t appear.
 Since he couldn’t derive anything about Life, he could only put it aside for the time being.  If the other party really wanted to hurt him, he had to enter the Heavenly Dao first.
 The Heavenly Dao Sages also discovered this. This surprised them, so they worked very hard to develop the Heavenly Dao.
 Han Jue began to observe the Immortal World.
 The number of living beings in the Immortal World and the myriad worlds had been increasing rapidly. Especially after the opening of the Chaotic Heavenly Road, a large number of cultivators had stepped onto it, causing the Heavenly Dao to have even less pressure to survive.
 The Immortal World’s continent was constantly expanding, and the mortal world was also constantly increasing its Spirit Qi.
 Ascension was the main theme of the mortal world.
 The Heavenly Road was the main theme of the Immortal World.
 One level after another, it made all living beings feel that cultivation was endless.
 Han Jue was very satisfied with the current changes in the Heavenly Dao. It had to be said that the Heavenly Dao Sages were still very talented, especially in bewitching the will of all living beings.
 Han Jue thought happily. His dream was to be so grand and low-key.
 He observed carefully and discovered that the number of Zenith Heaven Golden Immortals in the Immortal World had already doubled, especially those in the Emperor Realm and Deity Realm.
 In the era of geniuses, cultivation was extremely prosperous. Even the mortals of the Human Race had been tested for their spiritual roots.
 Of course, the humans of the mortal world had not developed to this extent.
 The Famous Race, the Ancient Race, the Dragon Race, and so on were still powerful. They were not suppressed by the humans.
 Their identities were equivalent to the in-name disciples of the Hidden Sect, so the disciples would not bully them, not to mention that this was under Han Jue’s nose.
 Unknowingly, Han Jue, who had two Dao Fields and the Heavenly Dao, was already a colossus. In the Chaos, he was also a force that could not be underestimated.
 He could be invincible just by relying on the uniqueness of the Heavenly Dao.
 The prerequisite was not to provoke the Chaotic Deities.
 Even with such a huge force, Han Jue still maintained his original intention. He didn’t indulge in pleasure and continued to cultivate diligently.
 After Han Jue silently summarized his strength, his confidence increased greatly. Then, he entered cultivation again.
 The Chaotic Deities and the Dao Creators were blades placed above his head. If he wasn’t on the same level as them, Han Jue really couldn’t relax.
  He had to cultivate to be the strongest!
 On the other side.
 In the Dark Forbidden Zone.
 Two figures hung in the darkness, quietly looking in the same direction.
 They were surrounded by the black aura and could only see their human forms. They couldn’t see their true bodies, and their eyes flickered with green light.
 The other figure said in a low voice, “No, we have to investigate who the Dark Forbidden Lord is and if he’s hiding in the Heavenly Dao. Otherwise, we might end up like the Flame Race and the Calamity Race.”
 [1] Ming is the Chinese character of ‘Life’.


 “What if the Dark Forbidden Lord is here? Will we give up on attacking the Heavenly Dao?” the smaller figure asked in a low voice in a rather dissatisfied tone.
 The other figure was silent for a moment before saying, “Wait for my instructions. The current situation in the Chaos is unpredictable. Many old things that have lived in seclusion for countless years have appeared. We have to investigate who is behind the Heavenly Dao to avoid provoking an existence we can’t afford to offend.”
 The smaller figure was silent.
 They watched for a while more before disappearing.
 On the other side.
 Outside the 33rd Heaven.
 In the Universal Hall, Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du and Pan Xin sat opposite each other.
  Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du’s expression darkened as he asked, “Really?”
 Pan Xin nodded. “I don’t know who spread the rumors. They said that if the Heavenly Dao continues to develop, Pangu will definitely revive. It’s said that the twelve Ancestral Magi have already revived. Empress Houtu has also joined them and created a world in the Chaos to rebuild the Magus Race, causing the credibility of this rumor to increase greatly. Many factions have already appeared in the Chaotic Heavenly Road. I wonder when they will attack the Heavenly Dao.”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du fell into deep thought.
 Life?
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du frowned.
 After a long while…
 He slowly said, “I will try to find out about this Life with Teacher. During this period of time, you still have to take care of the Chaotic Heavenly Road. Don’t run around.”
 Pan Xin nodded, then stood up and left. In two steps, he disappeared without a trace. Looking in the direction he left, Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du frowned again.
 Pan Xin was being too abnormal!
 It was unknown how Han Jue subdued him.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du did not think too much about it. Instead, he began to cast a spell and contacted his master.
 More than two thousand years later.
 Han Jue was still cultivating when lines of words suddenly appeared in front of him.
 [Detected that you are already 300,000 years old and your life has taken another step forward. You have the following choices:]
 (1: Exit seclusion immediately and shock the Chaos. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment, a Heavenly Dao Spirit Stone, and a Supreme Treasure.]
 [2: Cultivate in a low-profile manner and stay away from trouble. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment and a Creation Spirit Stone.) Han Jue sighed. He was already three hundred thousand years old.
 Time was truly heartless.
 Han Tuo was also more than 200,000 years old. In that case, they were more like brothers.
 Cough!
 What was he thinking!
 Han Jue silently chose the second option to expand the Fiendcelestial Army.
 (You chose to cultivate in a low-profile manner and stay away from trouble. You obtained a Great Dao Fragment and a Creation Spirit Stone.)
 Han Jue took out the Creation Spirit Stone and his consciousness entered the Primordial World. He began to choose the Fiendcelestial
 Qi.
 In the end, he chose the Void Fiendcelestial and fused the Creation Spirit Stone with its Fiendcelestial Qi.
 Then, he threw himself into cultivation.
 This time, he planned to enter seclusion for ten thousand years to test the waters.
 He wanted to see if it was possible for him to stay in seclusion for ten thousand years at once.
 Han Jue quickly immersed himself in the Great Dao of Extreme Origin. Thousands of thoughts exploded in his mind, creating countless things and depicting the scene of the Great Dao more and more.
 In the vast starry sky, countless figures swarmed towards a huge Chaotic Beast. This Chaotic Beast was like a huge turtle. Above the turtle shell was a mountain covered in trees. The fruits on these trees were actually Dharma treasures of all kinds. They were dazzling and beautiful.
 Chu Shiren stood on a rock and watched the chaotic battle from afar. He saw the greed and cruelty of the cultivators.
  He couldn’t help but sigh.
 After leaving the Heavenly Dao, he discovered that the Chaos was even crueler than he had imagined. He originally thought that it would be very difficult to encounter human traces, but he discovered that it was not the case. Wherever there was an opportunity, there would be cultivators fighting. Some came from the Heavenly Dao, some from the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End, and some from other Chaotic Worlds.
 Beside Chu Shiren stood a masked woman with a graceful figure. She smiled and asked, “What? Are you afraid? You don’t dare to snatch it?”
 Hearing this, Chu Shiren said calmly, “Why snatch? If you snatch something from others today, they will try to snatch something from you tomorrow. Only by letting go can you obtain the Dao.”
 The masked woman rolled her eyes at him and did not say anything else.
 At this moment, a dragon roar sounded, suppressing all the sounds of fighting.
 All the cultivators turned their heads to look. In the depths of the darkness, space shattered. A golden dragon charged out with unstoppable force. On the dragon’s head stood a man in silver armor. Behind the dragon were countless Heavenly Troops with a terrifying aura.
 “It’s the Heavenly Court!”
 “He’s stepping on a golden dragon and wearing silver armor. That’s Heavenly Court’s Divine General Han!” a cultivator exclaimed. The tens of thousands of cultivators surrounding the Chaotic Beast quickly dispersed.
 Divine General Han? Chu Shiren’s gaze landed on Han Tuo, and he couldn’t help but be stunned.
 He pinched his fingers to deduce with a strange expression.
 He couldn’t deduce Han Tuo because he had already attained the Dao.
 However, Han Tuo looked very similar to Han Jue. He had previously learned from the Myriad Worlds Projection that Han Jue had a son named Han Tuo who was now following the Heavenly Court in battle.
 Could it be this Divine General Han?
 Han Tuo felt Chu Shiren’s gaze and glanced over, startling him.
 “Eh?”
 Han Tuo saw the karma on Chu Shiren at a glance. He was a Hidden Sect disciple.
 A Pseudo-Sage was probably a personal disciple of his father.
 Han Tuo shouted, “This is the Heavenly Court’s affairs. Hurry up and retreat. Otherwise, we’ll kill you all!”
 The Heavenly Court’s reputation had long resounded through the Chaos. The three Divine Generals were terrifying existences who had killed countless people.
 Han Tuo approached the Chaotic Beast.
 The Chaotic Beast let out a low roar and wanted to escape. Han Tuo raised his hand, and his Dharmic powers transformed into chains that wrapped around the huge Chaotic Beast, preventing it from moving.
 Han Tuo suddenly glanced at Chu Shiren and sent a voice transmission, “Come over and choose three Dharma treasures. Choose whatever you want.”
 Chu Shiren was stunned.
 Han Tuo waited quietly with his back facing him.
 Looking at his back, Chu Shiren suddenly thought of Han Jue.
 It was too similar.
 Chu Shiren did not hesitate and immediately flew over.
 The masked woman hurriedly asked, “Don’t go over! They’re from the Heavenly Court!”
 Chu Shiren ignored her and quickly flew towards the Chaotic Beast.
 The Heavenly Troops wanted to stop him, but Han Tuo raised his hand and told them not to move.
 The cultivators in the distance all stared at Chu Shiren, not knowing what he wanted to do.
  Soon, Chu Shi chose three Supreme Treasures.
 Whoosh
 All the cultivators were shocked.
 Who was this person?
 He still dared to choose a treasure in front of the Heavenly Court, and the Heavenly Court did not stop him!
 Chu Shiren came in front of Han Tuo and cupped his fists. “Thank you.”
 Chu Shiren hesitated for a moment before nodding in agreement.


 The weakest of these Heavenly Soldiers was at the Grand Unity True Immortal Realm. There was no lack of Deity Realm cultivators. All of them were at the Deity Realm and could only be Heavenly Soldiers!
 The Heavenly Generals under Han Tuo were all Zenith Heaven Golden Immortals. All of them emitted a murderous aura that made people not dare to approach.
 Han Tuo led the Heavenly Troops forward and greeted him.
 Han Tuo was almost not by Han Jue’s side. He had been wandering in the Chaos and cultivated faster than the personal disciples.
 Chu Shiren could only blame it on the difference in potential.
  Dragons gave birth to dragons and phoenixes gave birth to phoenixes. Han Jue’s direct bloodline was naturally a prodigy with unparalleled potential.
 Chu Shiren briefly told him the situation but did not go into detail. How strong the Hidden Sect was was a secret that could not be revealed.
 Han Tuo suddenly asked, “Do I have a younger brother or sister?”
 Chu Shiren was stunned and hesitated, not knowing if he should say it.
 At this moment, the masked woman who had been with Chu Shiren flew over and was stopped by the Heavenly Soldiers. Han Tuo remembered that she was standing with Chu Shiren, so he looked at him and asked, “An acquaintance? Do you want to bring her along?”
 Chu Shiren thought for a moment and said, “Bring her along. She saved my life.”
 Han Tuo raised his hand to signal the Heavenly Soldiers to move.
 Han Tuo smiled. “Very sensible.”
 He looked at Chu Shiren again and waited for his reply.
 Chu Shiren sighed to himself and said truthfully, “You do have a younger brother, but he’s not born yet.”
 Han Tuo was stunned and asked in surprise, “Why isn’t he born yet? Hasn’t he been gestating for tens of thousands of years?”
 Chu Shiren smiled bitterly. “That’s right. It’s indeed a long time, but he’s still gestating in his mother’s womb. He doesn’t seem like a human at all. He’s more like another Connate lifeform.”
 “Then, his potential should be very strong.” Han Tuo sighed.
 It wasn’t just very strong. It was definitely world-shaking.
 No wonder it could resonate with his bloodline.
 Han Tuo would never forget that terrified and uneasy feeling in the past. For this, the Evil Heavenly Emperor even brought him to visit an ancient and mysterious supreme existence.
 He was a little terrified, not knowing if it was good or bad to say this.
 Han Jue was very powerful. It was normal for children to fight for power in the future.
 Han Tuo saw his expression and guessed what he was thinking. He said helplessly, “What are you thinking? How can I be jealous of my younger brother? Besides, Father loves me very much. If not for Father paying attention to me, I would have died countless times in the Chaos.”
 Ever since Han Jue took action that day, Han Tuo attributed all his past troubles to his father’s help.
 Chu Shiren asked curiously, “Grandmaster can also save you despite staying in the Heavenly Dao?”
 “Yes! That day…”
 Han Tuo began to talk about the scene of Han Jue attacking. He was very excited, and his face was filled with admiration.
 Chu Shiren instantly thought of a Mystical Power.
 Heaven Earth Mystic Yellow World Piercing Sword Finger!
 He also knew this Mystical Power, but it was not as terrifying as Han Jue’s.
 From the Heavenly Dao to the depths of the chaos…
 Chu Shiren was extremely shocked just by listening to Han Tuo.
 How terrifying was Grandmaster’s potential?!
 He had been in seclusion in the Heavenly Dao. Other than his cultivation, his strength was also rapidly increasing.
 It was too exaggerated.
 The more they chatted, the more familiar they became with one another.
 The Heavenly Generals were also whispering. Han Tuo was usually extremely serious. Even when facing the Heavenly General, he was rarely so happy.
 Who was this person?
 …
 Ten thousand years passed very quickly, especially for Han Jue, who was in seclusion.
 He opened his eyes and heaved a sigh of relief.
 Ten thousand years passed. There was no wind or waves in the Hidden Sect. At least, it did not affect his cultivation.
 Han Jue was both relieved and disappointed.
 The disciples had all grown up and did not seem to need him.
 The Heavenly Dao was the same. Everything was official, and the Sages usually did not disturb him.
 “I’m really a masochist. Isn’t this a good thing?”
 Han Jue smiled self-deprecatingly and looked at the Daoist temple next door.
 He discovered that Xing Hongxuan was not cultivating. Instead, she was chatting with Xuan Qingjun about children.
 Xing Hongxuan also expressed her worry. Although being pregnant with her son could help her cultivation increase quickly, she felt that she was squeezing out her son’s potential.
 Not long ago, Xing Hongxuan had just broken through to the Pseudo-Sage Realm and had already caught up to his personal disciples. Xuan Qingjun was envious.
 She also wanted to get pregnant. This way, her cultivation level would increase rapidly like Xing Hongxuan.
 Han Jue eavesdropped for a while and then turned to the Heavenly Dao.
 He remembered that a thousand years ago, someone had obtained the Sage position.
 This person was called Xu Dudao.
 Han Jue counted with his fingers, then his expression turned strange.
 Xu Dudao had actually acknowledged Immortal Emperor Samsara as his master in the past and later joined Pan Xin.
 Pan Xin should have deduced the karma between him and Immortal Emperor Samsara and also deduced the relationship between Immortal Emperor Samsara and Han Jue, so he supported Xu Dudao.
 After the Earth Immortal World entered the Heavenly Dao, the Reincarnation Space was no longer a secret to the Sages. All the Sages knew that Immortal Emperor Samsara was Han Jue’s subordinate.
 Han Jue also formed his own network. In the future, the Sages would probably have to accept his kindness.
 This was a little like the Dao Ancestor.
 When the Dao Ancestor was still around, almost all the Sages came from his disciples. There were no Sages outside the Dao Sect.
 Cough!
 I’m different from the Dao Ancestor!
 Han Jue cursed himself for thinking too much.
 Very good.
 Han Jue went to the second Dao Field.
 He released the Flesh Fiendcelestial. The Chaotic Fiendcelestial was born with the cultivation of a Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal.
 He asked Murong Qi to receive him and sent a voice transmission to Han Ming.
 Han Ming quickly entered the temple and bowed to him.
 Han Jue said, “Why are you depressed recently?”
 He had just seen the other Fiendcelestials gathered together to cultivate. Han Ming was still hiding in a corner alone.
 Han Ming gritted his teeth and said, “Even though the Dao Field is filled with Spirit Qi, my cultivation speed is still very slow. I feel like I’ve embarrassed you.”
 Han Jue thought for a moment and decided to transform Han Ming into a Chaotic Fiendcelestial in advance. He was already a Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal and should be able to withstand it.
  However, before that, he had to transform Guan Bubai into a Chaotic Fiendcelestial. Otherwise, he would be jumping the queue.
 Therefore, Han Jue called Guan Bubai in.
 When Guan Bubai heard this, he was immediately excited and nodded desperately.
 Han Ming’s eyes lit up.
 Han Jue directly dispersed their bodies and placed their souls into the Primordial World. He multitasked and fused them with the two balls of Fiendcelestial Qi.
 The Heavenly Dao became stronger and stronger. Han Jue’s Fiendcelestial Army also had to speed up.
 After this fusion, he prepared to preach the Dao in the second Dao Field to help the cultivation of the Fiendcelestials increase rapidly. Murong Qi, the crimson fox, and the Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial were the earliest Chaotic Fiendcelestials. It was time for them to attain the Dao.


 When he opened the emails, Han Jue was filled with anticipation.
 He had not read emails for ten thousand years. It would probably be very exciting.
 The feeling of opening a mystery box appeared again.
 [Your disciple Zhao Xuanyuan fell into the Chaotic Abyss. The karma is concealed.]
  (Your disciple Dao Sovereign was attacked by demons] x80213228
 (Your good friend Jiang Yi was attacked by demons] x73346421
 (Your good friend Divine Lord Peacock has joined the Heavenly Court.)
 (Your good friend Empress Houtu was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure and was severely injured.)
 (Your good friend Ancestor Xitian has entered the Source of Darkness. His soul has been cleansed by the dark power and he has been reborn.]
 (Your disciple Zhou Fan used the Great Dao Tower to spy on the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity and suffered a backlash.]
 Dao Sovereign and the other two were being beaten again, especially Zhao Xuanyuan, who had fallen into danger.
 However, Han Jue was not worried. In any case, these three had already left a backup plan in the Hundred Peak Immortal River. It was fine even if they died.
 Why did Divine Lord Peacock join the Heavenly Court?
 He had to ask later. He couldn’t let the Curse Fiendcelestial off.
 Further down, Han Jue saw many good friends obtaining opportunities.
 Li Xuan’ao, who controlled the outer sect of the Hidden Sect, Han Yu of Buzhou Divine Mountain, Dao Comprehension Sword of the Holy Mother Sect, Huang Zuntian of the Jie School, and so on went to the Chaos to seek opportunities.
 The Immortal World still used spirit pills and spirit stones as currency. The mortal world was even more vulgar. It still stopped at gold, silver, and jewelry.
 Just by reading the emails, Han Jue could feel the waves of the era.
 The Heavenly Dao was expanding into the Chaos with a domineering aura!
 After reading the emails, Han Jue sent a dream to Divine Lord Peacock.
 The dream was in the void.
 Divine Lord Peacock opened his eyes and saw Han Jue, who had transformed into the Dark Forbidden Lord. He immediately raised his eyebrows and snorted. “You came as soon as I stopped chasing after the Curse Fiendcelestial. It seems that you have been watching me very closely.”
 Han Jue asked, “What have you been doing recently?”
 Divine Lord Peacock couldn’t help but curse. “Don’t mention it. Previously, I almost killed the Curse Fiendcelestial. In the end, an existence called Life interfered and I was almost severely injured. That fellow threatened to unify the Chaotic Fiendcelestials and kill Pangu’s orthodoxy. He advised me to stay away from trouble and not participate in the overall situation. He’s too arrogant.”
 Life again?
 Han Jue asked, “He can’t kill you?”
 Divine Lord Peacock snorted. “How is that possible? I’m at the perfected Freedom Realm, after all. How can he kill me so easily?”
 Han Jue immediately looked down.
 In any case, he could easily kill Divine Lord Peacock.
 However, this fellow was with the Curse Fiendcelestial and even wanted to unify the Chaotic Fiendcelestials. He was really ambitious.
 “I joined the Heavenly Court to investigate this Life. The Evil Heavenly Emperor was also threatened by him. Isn’t he also your subordinate?” Divine Lord Peacock shrugged.
 Han Jue said, “Chasing the Curse Fiendcelestial is your main mission. As for Life, be careful. He’s not someone you can deal with. Don’t die.”
 Divine Lord Peacock snorted. “I don’t believe it. He’s hiding his true appearance and karma. He must be scared. This means that his strength is not enough to withstand the hatred his arrogance attracts.”
 Han Jue felt like he had been insulted.
 This little peacock’s words were always so unpleasant.
 Han Jue lost interest and quickly removed the dream.
 He opened his eyes and frowned.
 Who was this Life?
 “I want to know who injured Divine Lord Peacock and Heavenly Calamity Emperor,” Han Jue asked in his mind.
 Few people could hurt these two.
 (Unable to deduce. There is no such karma.]
  Han Jue showed a frown.
 There was an existence that even the system could not deduce?
 It had to be known that even Pangu and the Dao Ancestor could expose some karma.
 Could it be that Life was stronger than them?
 Han Jue had no choice but to ask in another way, “Why is there a situation that can’t be deduced?”
 (Either the other party far exceeds the system’s limit, or the other party has a special Supreme Treasure.]
 Special Supreme Treasure…
 It should be the second reason. If Life was so strong, he could directly destroy the Chaos. Why did he have to do so many tricks?
 Han Jue didn’t believe it and asked a few more times, but he still couldn’t deduce anything.
 He could only give up.
 “The other party has already targeted the Heavenly Dao. Since I can’t deduce it, I’ll wait for him to attack.”
 After Han Jue thought it through, his brows relaxed.
 san
 The current Heavenly Dao was no longer the same as before. It was not something that any random Chaotic Race could overturn.
 Han Jue sent a voice transmission to Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du, telling him to prepare well and not let his guard down.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du was not surprised and directly agreed. He probably knew about the existence of Life.
 Then, Han Jue closed his eyes and continued cultivating
 Han Jue went to the second Dao Field and released Han Ming and Guan Bubai.
 Guan Bubai transformed into the Unbeatable Fiendcelestial, and Han Ming transformed into the Soul Fiendcelestial.
 As for the Void Fiendcelestial, it was still being nurtured. He still had to wait for a period of time. The original Chaotic Fiendcelestial had an additional soul-nurturing process than fusion, so it was slower. Moreover, every Chaotic Fiendcelestial was different. The nurturing time was not constant. It all depended on Han Jue’s understanding
 “Is this the Chaotic Fiendcelestial?”
 Guan Bubai sized up his body and was extremely excited.
 Han Ming was the same.
 Han Jue waved his hand and sent them out. Then, he returned to the main Dao Field and summoned Li Yao into the Daoist temple.
 “Are you ready?” Han Jue asked seriously.
 Li Yao took a deep breath and said, “I’m already prepared.”
 Han Jue said, “From now on, you will leave the Hundred Peak Immortal River and even sever your connection with the Myriad Worlds Projection.”
 Li Yao was stunned, but she still nodded.
 Han Jue didn’t say anything else. He directly destroyed her body and threw her soul into the Primordial World, fusing with one of the Fiendcelestial Qi.
 After Li Yao successfully nurtured it, Han Jue would preach the Dao to the second Dao Field.
 Didn’t Life want to unite the Chaotic Fiendcelestials?
 At that time, they would see whose Chaotic Fiendcelestials were stronger!
 Of course, he hoped that Life could last until then.
 Han Jue thought.
 He was about to close his eyes and cultivate when Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du’s voice sounded.
 Han Jue looked up and confirmed that there were no unfamiliar existences outside the 33rd Heaven before jumping into the Universal Hall.
  The Sages had already gathered here.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du, South Extreme Heavenly Venerate, Sect Master Tian Jue, Emperor Xiao, Heavenly Venerate Wufa, Qiu Xilai, Shi Dudao, Li Daokong, Fang Liang, Huang Zuntian, Jin Shen, Pan Xin, and Xu Dudao.
 This was the current lineup of Heavenly Dao Sages.
 Seeing Han Jue, the Sages nodded. The new Sage, Xu Dudao, hurriedly stood up and bowed.
 “This is the new Sage. He has a relationship with you and has obtained the inheritance of Immortal Emperor Samsara.” Pan Xin smiled and introduced him.
 Xu Jiu said respectfully, “Greetings, Senior.”
 Han Jue nodded slightly.
 (Xu Dudao has developed hatred towards you. Current Hatred Points: 2 stars]


 Was there something wrong with this fellow?
 Han Jue saw the hatred notification and remained calm. He nodded slightly at Xu Dudao and sat beside Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du.
 The other Sages were all seated.
 The Sages were in an uproar.
 “Trample the Heavenly Dao? Who is he? He’s so arrogant!”
  “What a joke. Even the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End can’t do it. What right does he have to speak arrogantly?”.
 “Where is this person from?”
 “Life?”
 Although the Sages were shocked, they did not panic.
 The Heavenly Dao was special. Even existences above the Sages could not barge in. If they wanted to attack the Heavenly Dao, they could only send living beings below the Sage Realm into the Heavenly Dao and destroy the providence of the Heavenly Dao, causing it to collapse. Only then could mighty figures step in.
 Han Jue didn’t participate in the discussion and only listened quietly.
 Although he was not staring at Xu Dudao, he was observing this guy.
 It was really strange for Xu Dudao to develop 2-star hatred towards him for no reason.
 Han Jue first thought of Life.
 Could this fellow be related to Life?
 Otherwise, how could it be so coincidental?
 Han Jue used the simulation trial to test but didn’t see any words related to Life in the introduction.
 “I want to know if Xu Dudao is related to the outside world beyond the Heavenly Dao?” Han Jue asked.
 (3 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 (Yes]
 I knew it!
 Han Jue continued to deduce.
 “Who is Xu Dudao in contact with?”
 (Unable to deduce. There is no such karma.]
 Han Jue was amused.
 Life hid his karma, but it couldn’t hide the fact that he was in contact with Xu Dudao.
 Oh my, Life, you’re really careless.
 If Han Jue didn’t have the system and couldn’t discover the Sage’s impression of him, he might really have succeeded. Han Jue sneered in his heart, but he didn’t immediately stand up to point out Xu Dudao.
 He was thinking about how to make use of this fellow’s identity.
 He had to understand how strong Life was.
 Then, Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du began to arrange defenses.
 Apart from Han Jue, all the Sages were arranged
 Xu Dudao suddenly asked, “What about Senior Han? If the Heavenly Dao doesn’t have Senior Han’s protection, I’m not confident.’
 He revealed a worried expression as if he was really worried about the Heavenly Dao.
 Heavenly Venerate Wufa glanced at him and said, “This is confidential.”
 The other Sages also revealed thoughtful expressions.
 Xu Dudao was still too inexperienced to play tricks in front of them.
 Pan Xin was no longer the boorish man from before. He could also tell what Xu Dudao was thinking. He couldn’t help but look embarrassed. He glared at him and berated him. “How can you, a new Sage, dictate what Fellow Daoist Han does?”
 Xu Dudao said fearfully, “I’m not pointing fingers. It’s just that I’ve heard of the legend of the Immeasurable Merit Divine Might Heavenly Sage. Not only me, but in the hearts of all living beings, Senior Han is also the greatest protection of the Heavenly Dao.”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “Alright, don’t be suspicious of each other in times of danger.”
 The Sages nodded.
 Han Jue didn’t speak. He smiled and looked extremely easygoing.
  Xu Dudao did not dare to speak anymore. He was secretly shocked.
 “Why are the Sages protecting him? Is it fear? But in the Heavenly Dao, Sages are undying. There’s no need to rush to please him…”
 Xu Dudao couldn’t figure it out.
 easo
 The reason why the Heavenly Dao could develop quickly was that the Sages were united!
 Why were they united?
 All because they listened to Han Jue?
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du asked Pan Xin to report the situation of the Chaotic Heavenly Road.
 Pan Xin explained non-stop, the smugness on his face growing
 The Chaotic Heavenly Road was definitely supported by him. Now that it had begun to increase the providence of the Heavenly Dao, he naturally had the greatest merit!
 After he finished speaking, Shi Dudao said, “I’ll also head to the Chaotic Heavenly Road. I can spar with the experts of the Chaotic World. It’s said that many Sages in the Chaotic World use their strength to attain the Dao or those who kill three corpses to attain the Dao.”
 Li Daokong said, “Then, I’ll go too!”
 Shi Dudao rolled his eyes and cursed. “How long are you going to pester me? You’re not my match!”
 Li Daokong chuckled and did not reply. The Sages were already used to it, and Han Jue didn’t interfere. If he spoke, he would either use his power to suppress others or let Li Daokong suffer. No matter what, it was inappropriate.
 Moreover, the battle between the two was already benign. Actually, Shi Dudao also enjoyed fighting. If not for Li Daokong, how could he keep improving?
 An hour later, the Sages left.
 Han Jue suddenly smiled at Xu Dudao and said, “I see that you’re quite concerned about the Heavenly Dao. Come to my Dao Field. I’ll preach the Dao for you and increase your strength. You can also serve the Heavenly Dao in the future.”
 Hearing this, Xu Dudao was pleasantly surprised and hurriedly agreed.
 The other Sages had different reactions. Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du had the strangest expression.
 Han Jue waved his sleeve and brought Xu Dudao to the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 After entering the Daoist temple, Xu Dudao was about to speak when Han Jue directly suppressed him and imprisoned his consciousness.
 Time passed.
 A thousand years passed in the blink of an eye.
 [Primordial Heavenly Prison has successfully enslaved the target.]
 (Xu Dudao has a favorable impression of you. Current favorability: Max.)
 Xu Dudao opened his eyes and bowed respectfully to him.
 Han Jue asked, “Who contacted you in the Chaos?”
 Xu Dudao replied, “Life, a mysterious existence. I don’t know his true identity, either. He promised me that after destroying the Heavenly Dao, he would let me be the Heavenly Dao’s master.”
 Han Jue showed a frown.
 Did Xu Dudao not know Life’s identity?
 “You know nothing about him. How can you trust him?” Han Jue asked in confusion.
 Xu Dudao replied, “I’ve once stepped onto the Chaotic Heavenly Road and roamed the Chaos. I’ve seen his strength. He’s indeed terrifying. I witnessed him subdue a Chaotic Fiendcelestial…”
 He looked terrified.
 Han Jue’s eyes lit up.
 He asked for more details, and Xu Dudao said everything he knew.
 In the end, Han Jue let him stay the same and pretend that he did not submit to him.
 He sent Xu Dudao to the 33rd Heaven and used the derivation function.
 “I want to see the battle described by Xu Dudao!”
  Han Jue directly avoided Life and deduced from the perspective of the Chaotic Fiendcelestial and Xu Dudao.
 (200 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 Han Jue’s consciousness fell into the illusion.
 He opened his eyes and saw that he was standing beside Xu Dudao.
 Xu Dudao trembled like a candle in the storm, about to be extinguished at any moment.
 Two figures were fighting in the depths of the lightning
