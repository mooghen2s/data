 Son of the Ninth Chaos!
 No wonder he could control the Chaotic Will!
 Chaotic cultivation should mean that his cultivation level was on par with the Chaos.
 With such a high level of hatred, it seemed that Han Jue had grasped his weakness.
 The Nine-Headed Divine Spirit was indeed afraid that all living beings would be slaughtered!
 Han Jue snorted in his mind. He wasn’t in a hurry to continue speaking and waited for the Nine-Headed Divine Spirit to answer.
 The Nine-Headed Divine Spirit, who had transformed into the Chaotic Will, had an unseen expression, but from the hatred, his expression was definitely not good.
 The Nine-Headed Divine Spirit asked in a low voice, “Han Jue, it’s not impossible to restore everyone’s memories. However, you have to give in as well. Back then, the Dao Ancestor promised to restrict the future of the Heavenly Dao. Where’s your promise?”
 Han Jue smiled. “My promise is not to use the Dao Destruction Mystical Power.”
  The Nine-Headed Divine Spirit was furious, but in order to maintain the coldness of the Chaotic Will, he did not show it.
 Han Jue continued to wait.
 After a long while…
 The Nine-Headed Divine Spirit suddenly emitted terrifying killing intent. It locked onto Han Jue and said, “Threatening the Chaotic Will won’t end well for you!
 “Dao Destruction Mystical Power? That’s only a Heavenly Dao Mystical Power. How can it destroy all living beings in the Chaos?”
 The Chaotic Will suddenly attacked. Han Jue felt endless darkness devouring him. Other than darkness, there was only the Chaotic Will in his eyes.
 He did not wait for death. He took out the Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal and was about to attack when he suddenly looked up. He saw countless chains formed by lightning descending and quickly trapping him. His limbs were locked.
 The Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal collided with the chains.
 The Chaotic Will appeared in front of him. Their eyes met and Han Jue saw a pair of extremely cold eyes that looked like snakes and humans. It made him feel as if he was in a cold cellar.
 Han Jue broke free from the countless chains and used the Divine Might Great Heaven Palm. His right palm directly pierced through the Chaotic Will’s body as if nothing happened.
 At this moment, an indescribable force exploded from Han Jue’s body, instantly tearing his body apart!
 …
 In the third Dao Field.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and asked in his mind, “Can the Dao Creator infiltrate my third Dao Field?”
 Although he was already prepared, he still had to ask.
 [No]
 Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief.
 The living beings in the third Dao Field were all nurtured by him. There was no Chaotic Karma or providence at all. Xing Hongxuan had already passed a round of Absolute Purification and escaped the control of the Chaotic Karma and the Chaotic Will. Qingluan’er’s Heavenly Dao Karma was very shallow and she was sealed in the Primordial World by Han Jue. She wasn’t in the third Dao Field.
 The current third Dao Field had no karma with the Chaos and the Heavenly Dao. It couldn’t be controlled by the Chaotic Will.
 The third Dao Field’s array formation could resist a Creator Lord!
 However, there was no Creator Lord in the current world!
 Han Jue stood up. His eyes were cold as he quickly walked out of the third Dao Field.
 He came in front of Ancestor Tian Xu and said, “Leave your soul fragment behind. I’ll send you out. After you leave, immediately use the Life of All. I want all the living beings in the Chaos to die!”
 Ancestor Tian Xu immediately split a soul fragment without another word.
 Han Jue waved his sleeve and sent him out.
 Ancestor Tian Xu appeared in the Chaotic Void and immediately raised his hands to execute Life of All.
 The Dharmic powers of a perfected Great Dao Supreme quickly changed, turning into a golden impact that rushed out of his body. It was like a golden circle that quickly expanded and swept through the Chaos!
 The Nine-Headed Divine Spirit appeared in front of him and said angrily, “How dare
 you!”
 With that, Ancestor Tian Xu’s body instantly exploded, leaving only a head.
 Ancestor Tian Xu stared at the Nine-Headed Divine Spirit with a murderous gaze and did not say a word.
 The Nine-Headed Divine Spirit was infuriated.
 Life of All was too fast!
 In less than a breath of time, it swept through all living beings in the entire Chaos!
 All the living beings in the world were reduced to ashes. Every living thing was affected.
 It was not only the Chaotic lifeforms. The living beings of the Heavenly Dao were also reduced to ashes.
 The Nine-Headed Divine Spirit said angrily, “Crazy! Lunatic! Han Jue! You will definitely be doomed for eternity!”
 He raised his hand and crushed Ancestor Tian Xu’s head. Then, he began to search for Han Juels aura.
 Soon, he arrived at the universe of stars.
 All the newly born living beings in the universe of stars were also destroyed. As for Liu Bei, he had long been taken back by Han
 Jue.
 As his clone, Liu Bei’s memories were not changed by the Chaotic Will.
 The Nine-Headed Divine Spirit went to the third Dao Field and attacked crazily, wanting to barge into it.
 Unfortunately, the third Dao Field did not move no matter how he attacked.
 The in-name disciples, Liu Bei, Ancestor Tian Xu, and Xing Hongxuan looked at the terrifying Nine-Headed Divine Spirit in panic.
 Han Jue was very calm.
 “Husband, could he…” Xing Hongxuan asked carefully.
 Han Jue said, “I never do anything I’m not confident in. I’m just pretending to be crazy.”
 He wanted to bet on a possibility!
 Ninth Chaos!
 If he gambled wrongly, at most, he would hide in the third Dao Field and cultivate until he reached the Creator Lord Realm before going out. At that time, the five Dao Creators wouldn’t be enough for him to crush with one hand!
 The Nine-Headed Divine Spirit’s Mystical Power rumbled extremely loudly and echoed throughout the entire Chaos. However, there were no longer any living beings in the Chaos. Even the Great Dao Divine Spirits had perished.
 The Ultimate God of Punishment appeared and looked at the Nine-Headed Divine Spirit in shock.
 “What is this?”
 The Ultimate God of Punishment sighed.
 At this moment, he also felt a few powerful auras. They were not weaker than him and didn’t participate in the battle against Han Jue.
 “Indeed, there are still so many mighty figures hidden in the Chaos…”
 The Ultimate God of Punishment thought to himself.
 He looked up and noticed that the three thousand Great Dao began to shrink.
 With the death of all living beings in the Chaos, the power of rules began to weaken. The Chaotic Space began to collapse.
 It was returning to its initial state!
 The Nine-Headed Divine Spirit ignored the Ultimate God of Punishment and the worms lurking in the dark. He kept attacking and was extremely panicked.
 “How is that possible! Why can’t I barge in?”
 “Could it be the power of the Dao Creator?”
 “Divine Might Heavenly Sage… anomaly… Could it be…”
 The more the Nine-Headed Divine Spirit thought about it, the more panicked he became. Despair surged in his heart.
 He had gambled wrongly. He thought that Han Jue was bluffing. He didn’t expect him to really be able to destroy all living beings!
  The attack speed of the Nine-Headed Divine Spirit slowed down. Not long after, he stopped.
 He trembled and knelt in the void. From the point of view of the Ultimate God of Punishment, he seemed to be kneeling in front of Han Jue’s Dao Field!
 “This is…”
 The Ultimate God of Punishment was shocked. The Chaotic Divine Authority had also bowed down to his Master?
 However, that was not the case.
 At this moment, a figure appeared in front of the Nine-Headed Divine Spirit. Even a powerful existence like the Ultimate God of Punishment couldn’t spy on it.
 The Nine-Headed Divine Spirit looked at the blurry figure in front of him and said with a trembling voice, “Father… I was wrong…”
 Ninth Chaos!
 The Ninth Chaos woke up with the destruction of all living beings in the Chaos!
 Without receiving a reply from his father, the Nine-Headed Divine Spirit became even more nervous and began to beg for mercy.


 Han Jue couldn’t see the Ninth Chaos either, but he guessed the truth upon looking at the Nine-Headed Divine Spirit’s panicked appearance.
 The Ninth Chaos descended!
 Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief. He was gambling that the Ninth Chaos could uphold justice and revive all living beings.
 He had used the Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal to take in his disciples in the previous battle. However, there were two people outside who he had not grabbed in time. One was the Evil Heavenly Emperor and the other was Han Qing’er.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor had a Dao Creator behind him, but Han Qing’er was a little pitiful.
 There was no choice.
 Han Jue felt that the Ninth Chaos definitely had a way to revive all living beings. Otherwise, he would have stopped them long
 ago.
  If the Chaos was in trouble, how could they not know about such an extraordinary existence?
 The Ninth Chaos didn’t stop Han Jue, which meant that he didn’t care at all.
 Han Jue began to wait.
 The Nine-Headed Divine Spirit begged bitterly. When he said the word father, the Ultimate God of Punishment and the hidden mighty figures were shocked.
 Father?
 Wasn’t this the Chaotic Will?
 How could it have a father?
 The Ultimate God of Punishment and the others were confused.
 Could it be that this fellow was not the Chaotic Will?
 Apart from the Nine-Headed Divine Spirit, no one could see the Ninth Chaos slowly raise his right hand and press down on the Nine-Headed Divine Spirit’s head.
 The Nine-Headed Divine Spirit was so frightened that he didn’t dare to move.
 Boom
 The Nine-Headed Divine Spirit instantly exploded into dust.
 At the same time, the Ultimate God of Punishment seemed to sense something and was moved.
 He could feel life beginning to recover everywhere in the Chaos. The dead living beings revived one after another.
 Especially in the Grand Primordium Domain, the million Great Dao Sages had all been revived. Their auras gathered and were vast like smoke.
 In the third Dao Field.
 A notification appeared in front of Han Jue.
 [The Ninth Chaos sent you a dream. Do you accept?]
 Han Jue took a deep breath and asked in his mind, “Will I die if I accept the dream?”
 (100 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [No]
 He silently chose to continue.
 Dream.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and discovered that he was in a vast purple aura space.
 This was…
 Primordial Chaos!
 Han Jue turned around and saw a blurry black shadow looking at him from afar.
 “Who are you?” he asked in a low voice. Even if he knew, he had to pretend not to.
 A hoarse voice sounded, “Han Jue, you reincarnated from the Primordial Chaos. You floated between the Primordial Chaos and the Chaos for countless years before finally finding the Chaos and descending into the Heavenly Dao. You were determined by the Dao Ancestor to be an anomaly.”
 Han Jue was moved.
  He was really shocked.
 What did the Ninth Chaos mean? He was from the Primordial Chaos?
 Han Jue had always thought that the Earth in his previous life was in the Earth Immortal World because its development was the same as the Earth in his previous life. However, without him, his relatives would have long died.
 From the sound of it, could it be that the Earth he came from was not this Chaos?
 Han Jue was shocked.
 Could it be that the system was the power of rules of the Eighth Chaos?
 No wonder there were so many treasures. No wonder it had seen the Primordial Fiendcelestial.
 The Primordial Chaos was still around when the Eighth Chaos was destroyed, so the Primordial Fiendcelestial was naturally still around.
 Could this be the reason why the Ninth Chaos placed the Eighth Chaos’ reincarnation in the Heavenly Dao and became Su Qi’s disciple?
 He wanted him to receive the Eighth Chaos’ favor!
 Han Jue would be indebted to the Eighth Chaos if he was really born in the Eighth Chaos.
 However, this was all in the past. What he cared about the most was the Ninth Chaos’ attitude towards this matter.
 No matter what happened, he would fall out with them and hide in the Dao Field to cultivate if the Ninth Chaos wanted to target him!
 In this life, Han Jue only lived for himself. He wouldn’t give up his life to save the people around him if he could.
 What he did seemed crazy to the others, but he knew that it was a situation he was absolutely confident in.
 He was so selfish and never felt ashamed about it.
 He could have kindness, love, and feelings, but they couldn’t occupy his Dao heart that wanted to survive!
 The Ninth Chaos continued, “The so-called Chaotic Will is actually the identity of my son, the Nine-Headed Divine Spirit. Although I established the Ninth Chaos, I’m busy cultivating. I usually leave the Ninth Chaos to the Nine-Headed Divine Spirit to control. I’ve already deduced this matter. It’s not your fault. You can only blame him for being narrow-minded and not allowing juniors to surpass him. He’s even more afraid of anomalies outside the Chaos.”
 Not pursuing the matter?
 Han Jue was delighted.
 Ninth Chaos’ voice was still so hoarse that one couldn’t hear any emotions, but this time, it caused the surrounding nebulous Primordial Qi to surge violently.
 Han Jue said, “I didn’t want to do this, either. I was really desperate. With your cultivation level, you should be able to see everything I’ve done in my life. I’ve never provoked any existence. It’s always others who want to kill
 me.”
 I’ll hide in the Dao Field and see what you can do!
 The Ninth Chaos said, “I indeed know. This is also the reason why I’m willing to not pursue the matter. All living beings in the Chaos have already been revived by me, including all the living beings in the Heavenly Dao. It’s the same for your family. However, remember one thing. The Heavenly Dao can develop, but it must always be under the Great Dao Divine Spirits’ control and cannot be stronger than the power of a region. I shouldn’t tolerate the Heavenly Dao, but on account of the difficulties for all living beings, if they want to pursue a higher cultivation level, they can abandon the Heavenly Dao’s providence like
 you.”
 Han Jue was secretly afraid.
 Was this the reason why the Ninth Chaos had never attacked him?
 Although he was helping the Heavenly Dao, he didn’t have its karma and providence on him.
 He had been too naive in the past.
 Han Jue said, “Thank you for your understanding, Senior. May I ask what your Dao title is?”
  The Ninth Chaos said, “The Ninth Chaos is me. I am the Ninth Chaos.”
 “You are the Chaotic Will?”
 Han Jue pretended to be shocked.
 The Ninth Chaos said, “There’s no need to pretend. Actually, you’ve long spied on the existence above the Chaos. I wouldn’t have let you grow if not for the fact that you’re from the Eighth Chaos.”
 With that, the dream shattered.
 Ninth Chaos’ voice sounded in Han Jue’s ears.
 “Cultivate well. I won’t interfere in the matters of the Chaos. I look forward to the day you surpass the Chaos.”
 Han Jue opened his eyes and frowned.
 He suddenly couldn’t understand the Ninth Chaos. However, on second thought, if the Ninth Chaos did not want any Dao Creators to appear, there would only be one, not five.


 “How’s the situation?” Xing Hongxuan came up and asked nervously.
 She had already learned from Ancestor Tian Xu how terrifying Life of All was. The entire Chaos had been destroyed. She couldn’t imagine what kind of existence she would have to face if the matter couldn’t be solved.
 Han Jue said, “It’s already over. The Chaotic Will should have been removed now. The living beings destroyed have already been revived by the Lord of Chaos. But…”
 “But what?”
 Xing Hongxuan, Liu Bei, and Ancestor Tian Xu became nervous.
 Han Jue sighed. “It’s just a pity that Ancestor Tian Xu’s cultivation realm can’t be recovered.”
 The three of them were caught between laughter and tears.
 Ancestor Tian Xu said, “It’s fine. I’ll just cultivate again. To be honest, I don’t dare to bear such huge karma…”
 Destroy all living beings in the Chaos…
  This was definitely the craziest thing he had ever done.
 Han Jue smiled. “Let’s rest. I have to check the Heavenly Dao too.”
 With that, he vanished.
 At the same time.
 In the Grand Primordium Domain.
 The million Great Dao Sages looked at each other. The atmosphere was strange.
 The Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal suddenly appeared and released Han Huang and the others.
 Their appearance did not surprise the other mighty figures, who thought that they had just revived.
 “This calamity is over. We no longer have to target the Divine Might Heavenly Sage. The memories of all living beings have been recovered. Everyone from the future, we thank you here.”
 The Holy Mother of Order bowed. The other Great Dao Sages and Great Dao Divine Spirits bowed.
 Nearly a million mighty figures looked at each other, not knowing what to say.
 At this moment, the Chaotic Divine Authority appeared above and sucked away the million future experts.
 Han Huang looked at Han Yao and frowned.
 Han Yao turned around and smiled. “Ancestor Han Huang, I forgot to tell you. I’m still half your disciple. You have to take good care of me in the future!”
 Han Huang was stunned.
 Jiang Jueshi looked around and discovered that his future self had disappeared. He had not seen his future self when he revived.
 Soon, the million future experts were all sent back by the Chaotic Divine Authority. The Grand Primordium Domain fell silent.
 The Great Dao Divine Spirits and Great Dao Sages present looked at each other.
 Although the matter was over, how should they face the Divine Might Heavenly Sage?
 The memories of the previous battle were not erased. The Divine Might Heavenly Sage suppressed a million Great Dao Sages and thousands of Great Dao Supremes…
 The Ultimate God of Punishment suddenly appeared beside the Holy Mother of Order.
 The Holy Mother of Order bowed slightly.
 The Ultimate God of Punishment waved his hand and the nearby mighty figures left. Han Huang and the others were the same.
 Soon, only the two of them were left.
 The Ultimate God of Punishment asked, “You knew the truth long ago?”
 “Then, have you considered what the Divine Might Heavenly Sage thinks of you?” The Ultimate God of Punishment asked with a faint smile.
 The Holy Mother of Order said, “He will understand.”
 “Hehe.”
 Heavenly Dao, outside the 33rd Heaven, in the Universal Hall.
 The Sages gathered.
 “It’s like a dream.”
  “You feel the same?”
 “Indeed. What happened in the past few decades?”
 “I dreamed that the Heavenly Dao was destroyed.”
 “Isn’t it fine? It’s probably a mighty figure who wants to harm us. Fortunately, the Heavenly Dao has the Divine Might Heavenly
 Sage.”
 The Sages discussed and their gazes landed on Han Jue, who was beside Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du. Their eyes were filled with admiration.
 Han Jue was looking at the notification.
 It was all favorability notifications!
 It was too much for him to take in.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du smiled. “Since the Heavenly Sage has already said that it’s fine, let’s talk about the Chaotic Heavenly Roads. It has been destroyed many times over the years. We have to restore them.”
 The Sages were furious at the mention of this.
 More than half of the Chaotic Heavenly Roads had been destroyed. How could they not be angry? Most importantly, they didn’t know who to settle scores with. Han Jue didn’t interrupt. The clone in the Hundred Peak Immortal River was interacting with Li Xuan’ao and stabilizing order.
 In short, the calamity caused by the Chaotic Will was over.
 em
 All living beings did not remember what had happened, but the Great Dao Sages remembered it clearly and could be considered to have gained something.
 From now on, no one in the Chaos should dare to find trouble with Han Jue.
 The only problem was the Heavenly Dao’s development.
 Han Jue felt that he could give the Ninth Chaos some face.
 He could let the Heavenly Dao develop to the strength of a region at most and not any stronger.
 The Ninth Chaos could have chosen not to revive all living beings in the Heavenly Dao, but he had already displayed his extraordinary bearing. Han Jue naturally couldn’t pester him endlessly.
 r, it wouldn’t be of any practical help to him even if the Heavenly Dao developed well. Instead, it would benefit Pangu and the Dao Ancestor.
 Han Jue could now look at his Primordial World.
 Several hours later.
 Han Jue left the Universal Hall and returned to his Daoist temple.
 Just as he was meditating, a notification appeared in front of him.
 (The Holy Mother of Order sent you a dream. Do you accept?]
 Can’t sit still?
 Han Jue sneered.
 He wanted to refuse, but he decided to see what this fellow had to say after thinking about it.
 The Holy Mother of Order could summon the Chaotic Divine Authority. This was stronger than the Ultimate God of Punishment. She could be considered the most powerful among the Divine Spirits.
 The dream was the Holy Mother of Order’s domain. It was vast and boundless.
  Han Jue stood in the air and looked at the Holy Mother of Order. The Holy Mother of Order said, “Heavenly Sage, congratulations on passing this calamity.” Han Jue smiled.
 The Holy Mother of Order said, “Does the Heavenly Sage hate me for attracting so many powerful enemies?”
 “If not for dragging the future of the Chaos over, that unknown existence would not have acted. You can’t defeat the Chaotic Will. Even if you can stay here, your disciples, children, and the Heavenly Dao will all die. If only the living beings of the Chaos were destroyed, that existence would not have punished the Chaotic Will. You and the Chaotic Will would still be mortal enemies. You would still be in danger. Now that the future of the Chaos was affected, so the Chaotic Will naturally won’t survive.”
 Han Jue raised his eyebrows. That made
 sense.
 Han Jue said angrily, “You know that too.”
 The Holy Mother of Order said, “By doing this, at least the Chaotic Will won’t blame me. It can also force him to have no choice but to take action.”
 Han Jue didn’t reply.
 This grudge wouldn’t be resolved if she didn’t show some sincerity!


 The Holy Mother of Order said a lot, but it was nothing more than the analysis of the situation.
 The Holy Mother of Order was silent.
 Han Jue was not in a hurry. The opportunity was in front of her.
 If she rejected, Han Jue would also forcefully invite her to be a guest. After a long while…
 The Holy Mother of Order said, “Alright!”
 Han Jue smiled and nodded before breaking through the dream.
 He opened his eyes and thought for a moment. He would first take everyone in the third Dao Field into the Primordial World and release them after subduing the Holy Mother of Order. After all, she was also a Great Dao Supreme and could easily injure the others in the Dao Field.
 The Holy Mother of Order arrived quickly.
  She didn’t hide her aura. In the chaos, she was like a bright lamp moving through the darkness.
 She came to the third Dao Field and bowed slightly.
 Han Jue used the derivation function. After confirming that there was no danger, he moved the Holy Mother of Order in and directly used the Great Change Sealing Palm to forcefully seal her. Then, he released the disciples, Liu Bei, Xing Hongxuan, and Qingluan’er into the Primordial World. He then teleported to the main Dao Field and threw the Holy Mother of Order into the Primordial Heavenly Prison.
 The Holy Mother of Order sat beside Han Jue and stared at him calmly, not panicking at all.
 Han Jue couldn’t be bothered to say anything.
 Time passed quickly.
 A hundred thousand years passed quickly. The Holy Mother of Order had yet to be enslaved, but she had already lost consciousness. She sat in meditation like a statue.
 Han Jue opened his eyes. He was in a good mood.
 All these years of cultivation caused his cultivation level to steadily increase. Although the Dao Creator Realm was still far away, it was fine as long as he became stronger.
 After dealing with the Nine-Headed Divine Spirit, there should be no more trouble in the Chaos for a long time.
 The current Han Jue stood at the peak of the Chaos and had overwhelming power. No one dared to find trouble with him unless those ancient mighty figures who had been suppressed for a long time had already been abandoned by the era and couldn’t see the situation clearly.
 Even so, he would not let his guard down.
 For example, the Ninth Chaos directly suppressed the Nine-Headed Divine Spirit and waved his hand to revive all living beings. Han Jue was an ant in front of him.
 There were five Dao Creators!
 Han Jue looked at the situation of himself with the Ninth Chaos and seriously suspected that the other four Dao Creators might also have their own world. It was as vast as the Chaos and was created with the boundary evidence, so they rarely interfered with the Chaos.
 Of course, he was only guessing.
 In any case, the Chaos was definitely the strongest world. After all, the Ninth Chaos was the strongest.
 The value of the Ninth Chaos was 100 quadrillion years, while the Dao Creator was 1 quadrillion years. The difference was obvious.
 Han Jue started to check his emails.
 (Your good friend Jiang Yi was attacked by an Inauspicious Evil) x60982321
 [Your disciple Dao Sovereign was attacked by an Inauspicious Evil) x73110720
 (Your good friend Evil Heavenly Emperor has received guidance from a transcendent existence. His cultivation has increased greatly.)
 [Your good friend Huang Zuntian has entered the Divine Authority Domain. His providence has increased.]
 [Your son Han Huang was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure.]
 (Your good friend Azure Heaven Mystic has entered the Chaotic crack.]
 [Your son Han Tuo received guidance from your good friend, the Ultimate God of Punishment. His cultivation has increased greatly.)
 Peace was really good.
 Han Jue looked at his friends in the emails who had obtained different opportunities and felt relieved.
 What was so good about fighting?
 Han Jue began to look forward to the Chaotic Assembly. This event encountered many twists and turns. He had to open it!
 Han Jue continued cultivating after reading the emails.
 Tens of thousands of years later.
 The Holy Mother of Order was successfully enslaved and developed a favorable impression of him.
 After instructing the Holy Mother of Order and letting her out, Han Jue continued cultivating.
 No matter what, the cycle of seclusion could not change.
 Just like that, Han Jue only ended his cultivation after another hundred thousand years.
 He sent a dream to the Evil Heavenly Emperor.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor was dissolute and had countless sons. He definitely had a daughter.
 Evil Heavenly Emperor immediately smiled. “I also have the same intention. Then, I will definitely choose the woman with the best appearance to marry Huang’er. It’s just that Huang’er doesn’t like women. The only woman close to him is Qing’er.”
 “Tell him that I need him to spread my bloodline.”
 “Alright, hahaha!”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor laughed. He coveted Han Huang’s bloodline. It would be a good thing if he could spread his bloodline in the Heavenly Court.
 Han Jue brought Xuan Qingjun to the third Dao Field after the dream ended.
 She was finally pregnant after the two of them struggled for a period of time.
 The potential of this fetus was at most on par with Han Tuo.
 Han Jue established a new Daoist temple for Xuan Qingjun beside his Daoist temple. Then, he sent a dream to Han Yu after she settled down.
 He hoped that Han Yu could marry the woman beside him as soon as possible. These words made Han Yu very embarrassed, but he didn’t dare to refuse.
 Han Jue smiled in satisfaction after doing all of this.
 He hadn’t used the Creation Heaven’s Chosen yet.
 Actually, Han Jue could also use it directly. This way, his current children might obtain a Great Creation. However, this was not a good thing
 What would Han Huang think if Han Tuo or Han Qing’er obtained it?
 What would happen to Han Huang if he obtained it? He would definitely overturn the world in the future. Han Jue remembered clearly the future he created for Han Huang.
 This kid might face a calamity. He had to control him well.
 In addition, Han Jue also hoped that his bloodline could be passed down generation after generation. It couldn’t be that the higher the seniority, the stronger the talent. That would only lead to ruin.
 Moreover, the Creation Heaven’s Chosen had been used more than once. If someone was lucky and was chosen, that would be fate.
 A year later.
 Xuan Qingjun’s child was born. It was not a son, but a daughter. Han Jue named her Han Ling
 Han Ling wasn’t as lively as Han Qing’er. She was more reserved and rarely spoke.
 Xuan Qingjun continued to cultivate after Han Ling grew up. Ignoring her, Han Jue let his daughter stay in his Daoist temple and cultivate beside him.
 Han Jue could sense that Xuan Qingjun didn’t like Han Ling that much. She seemed to want a son more.
 Han Jue began to use the Creation Heaven’s Chosen upon seeing that his second daughter had already entered a cultivation state.
 [Activate the Creation Heaven’s Chosen. A random Great Creation will appear among your children.]
 (Your daughter Han Ling has awakened an Innate Great Creation-Primordial Emperor Star]
 As soon as these three lines of words appeared, Han Ling, who was beside Han Jue, suddenly changed. Strange purple Qi surrounded her body.


 Primordial Emperor Star?
 Han Jue’s eyelids twitched. It looked a little impressive.
 He carefully checked Han Ling’s introduction. The Primordial Emperor Star was only a Great Creation and not a bloodline. It was one of the Primordial Fates.
 From the looks of it, although there was only one Primordial Fiendcelestial during the Primordial Era, there were also Primordial lifeforms. Otherwise, the nine Chaos would not have been born.
 Han Jue sighed as he stared at his daughter.
 He didn’t expect a woman to obtain the Great Creation of an Emperor.
 Because Han Ling was restrained and didn’t like to talk, Han Jue doted on her. Now that he looked back, he did the right thing.
 Han Ling might have embarked on an evil path after obtaining the Great Creation if he had ignored her.
 As an Emperor, it was easy to be stubborn.
  The Spirit Qi in the third Dao Field began to surge into Han Ling’s body.
 Dressed in white, Han Ling had an otherworldly temperament. She had inherited Han Jue’s looks and was devastatingly beautiful. Her expression was cold, and a purple aura surrounded her. Gradually, a purple pattern condensed between her eyebrows.
 Han Ling finally woke up after several years.
 Her cultivation level quickly reached the Golden Immortal Realm in these few years. She was only a step away from the Emperor Realm.
 She opened her eyes and felt the extraordinariness in her body. She was pleasantly surprised and also a little nervous.
 She looked at her father and asked softly, “Father, there seems to be something wrong with me.”
 Han Jue didn’t even open his eyes. “That’s your own opportunity. Feel it well and do not worry. From now on, you will enter seclusion with me. Every time you enter seclusion, it will be for a hundred thousand years.”
 A hundred thousand years!
 Han Ling was moved, but she didn’t refuse and silently accepted this arrangement.
 Above the Chaos.
 Great Dao Divine Spirits gathered.
 The Holy Mother of Order, the Ultimate God of Punishment, and the Five Great Divine Punishers also came.
 After several years, the three thousand Great Dao finally calmed down.
 The Ultimate God of Punishment looked at the Holy Mother of Order and asked, “What did the Holy Mother deduce?”
 The Holy Mother of Order said, “An Innate Great Creation has descended. I can’t guess who it is or where it is.”
 The other Great Dao Divine Spirits discussed
 “Over the years, not only have there been more and more Great Dao Sages, but also more and more geniuses have appeared.” “Looks like the Divine Might Heavenly Sage is not the only one. He has begun a new era.”
 “We have to check our domains carefully. We have to grasp such a great opportunity well.”
 “That’s right.”
 “Unfortunately, this child will miss the first Chaotic Assembly.”
 Han Tuo and Yi Tian were also discussing this.
 Yi Tian sighed. “There are more and more demons. Your brother has an opponent.” Han Huang was already the number one prodigy of the Chaos. He was born as Freedom. Now that he was a Great Dao Sage, his cultivation talent was unparalleled, even the Divine Might Heavenly Sage was inferior.
 Yi Tian also smiled. “How about that woman last time? Did she really not catch your eye?”
 The other three Divine Punishers also revealed strange smiles.
 Han Tuo sighed. “I’m not in the mood to seek love. Don’t mention this anymore. As for my father, I’ll just apologize to him.”
 On the other side.
 The Ultimate God of Punishment said a few words and disappeared. The Holy Mother of Order left.
 After the three thousand Great Dao regained their calm, the Great Dao Divine Spirits naturally had no reason to stay. However, the news of this matter also spread in the Chaos. Countless domain mighty figures knew that a monstrous prodigy not inferior to Han Huang would appear in the Chaos.
 The news also reached the Heavenly Court.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor found Han Huang and told him about this.
 Han Huang, who was only a step away from the Great Dao Supreme Realm, had a stronger aura than the Evil Heavenly Emperor. He was no longer the rash kid from before.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor smiled. He knew Han Huang’s personality and could only mourn for that mysterious prodigy. “Your father asked to arrange a marriage for you. How about my subordinate, Princess Jiu Long? She’s my bloodline and has a Great Dao Sage as her master. Her talent is not bad. She’s not far from attaining the Primordial Chaos Realm. In terms of looks, she’s considered top-notch among my princesses.” The Evil Heavenly Emperor smiled.
 Han Huang frowned.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor said, “You’re already old enough. You should help spread the Han family bloodline. These are your father’s words. After all, your brother lost his wife back then and won’t marry again. If you refuse, the Han family will have no descendants.”
 Han Huang shook his head. “Thank you for your kind intentions, Your Majesty. Princess Jiu Long is indeed very good, but I don’t need a woman. I don’t want a weakness.”
 His eyes were firm.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor said helplessly, “Even if you don’t want a weakness, you have to have a woman, right? This is human nature.”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor was stunned.
 Han Huang stood up and twisted his body. He smiled and said, “Your Majesty, I’ll help you take down the world that the Heavenly Court has recently been stuck in. Just you wait!”
 With that, he transformed into a golden rainbow and sped away, disappearing from the palace in the blink of an eye.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor frowned and muttered, “Did something happen to this
 kid?”
 No!
 He had to think of a way!
 He wouldn’t be able to face Han Jue if Han Huang’s personality was distorted.
 A hundred thousand years later.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and looked at Han Ling beside him.
 The father and daughter did not speak for a hundred thousand years. If it were Han Qing’er, she would have long gone mad, but Han Ling’s personality was so patient.
 She had just turned eighteen and entered seclusion for a hundred thousand years. Who could stand it?
 Han Jue was very satisfied with her performance.
 Han Ling had already reached the Primordial Chaos Realm with the Primordial Emperor Star’s help Han Ling opened her eyes and looked happy upon sensing her father’s gaze.
 “Father…” Han Ling spoke softly.
 Han Jue touched her long hair. He smiled and said, “Not bad. I’m very satisfied.”
 Han Ling beamed. She raised her hand and waved. A purple figure appeared beside her
 W
 “Father, I discovered that every time I break through a minor realm, such an Emperor Soldier will appear in my soul. Its strength is the same as mine. Now, there are already ten thousand Emperor Soldiers in the depths of my soul.” Han Ling introduced. Although her voice was still very soft, she couldn’t hide the smugness in her tone.
 Ten thousand Sage-level Emperor Soldiers?
  Han Jue was shocked.
 Was the Primordial Emperor Star so terrifying?
 Even so, it was still very terrifying.
 The Creation Heaven’s Chosen was a little impressive.
 Han Jue said, “You have to hide this Emperor Army well. Unless it’s absolutely necessary, you can’t show it. You have to kill the enemy once you use it.”
 Kill?
 Han Ling was stunned. She had never even seen outsiders, so she naturally had no intention of killing them.
 Han Jue stood up and said, “Let’s go. Father will bring you out for a walk to gain experience and prevent anything from happening to you when you travel the Chaos in the future.”
 Han Ling stood up. “I’m willing to cultivate by your side forever. I don’t want to walk in the Chaos.”
