 Puzzled, Han Jue walked to the side and started watching the battle.
 “Do you really want to be my enemy?” The future Han Jue scanned the Hidden Sect disciples and asked expressionlessly.
 His voice entered everyone’s ears clearly. Everyone trembled in fear, including Han Huang and Han Tuo.
 His shout was like thunder, echoing non-stop. It immediately ignited everyone’s hatred and they cursed.
 “Demon, you destroyed the providence of my Heavenly Dao. You deserve death!”
 “Return my master!”
  “We have to kill him today, or the Chaos will be in danger!”
 “Kill him and save the Chaos!”
 “Damn it, there’s no need for me to keep my cultivation if I don’t avenge my Grandmaster today!”
 He suddenly smiled. It was so disdainful and mocking Han Jue muttered to himself. His future self had been possessed?
 Who can possess me?
 Dao Creator?
 The future Han Jue laughed loudly and said, “What a ridiculous Chaotic Will. I’ll destroy you if you fools insist on believing your memories and knowledge. If I can help you rise up, I can also destroy you with a flip of my palm. So what if you are my wives and children? So what if you are my disciples and grand-disciples? Chaotic Will, do you really think I have a hard time choosing?
 “Come, I’ll let you feel my power and let you experience the fear of the Despair Dao Spirit, the Divine Authority Generals, and the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit!”
 As the future Han Jue’s laughter fell, an aura that made Han Jue’s heart palpitate erupted.
 The illusion shattered.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and pondered.
 The Chaotic Will would change the memories and knowledge of all living beings and erect him as a Chaotic Evil Devil?
 It sounded impossible, but it did not seem so upon careful thought.
 His Ultimate Supreme Treasure, the Mystical Destiny Book, could do it. He had once used it to make the Chaotic living beings recognize him as a Chaotic Fiendcelestial.
 Since he could, why couldn’t the Chaos?
 He had used the Mystical Destiny Book at 800,000 years old. The cooldown time was ten million years. Now, he was very close to his ten-million-year-old birthday. If that really happened, he was not afraid.
 Chaotic Will would be destroyed if it changed the understanding of all living beings!
 After that, he would use the Mystical Destiny Book to recover everything.
 Han Jue found it ridiculous.
 The Hidden Sect alone could overturn him?
 The current Hidden Sect and the Chaotic Branch had more than ten billion disciples. There were already more than a million Zenith Heaven Golden Immortals, ten thousand Pseudo-Sages, and many Freedom Sages and Great Dao Sages. They looked like colossi, but they were like paper upon facing Han Jue’s absolute strength.
 Han Jue thought like this. Only he could teleport to the three Dao Fields. It was absolutely impossible for the disciples in the Hundred Peak Immortal River to forcefully enter the third Dao Field.
 The Chaotic Will was only targeting Han Jue. Even if he was abandoned by everyone, it wouldn’t affect the lives of the other disciples.
 Han Jue immediately stood up and left.
 He returned to the Hundred Peak Immortal River and brought Xing Hongxuan and Qingluan’er back to the third Dao Field before continuing to cultivate.
 No matter what, danger had already appeared. He had to take it seriously even if he was confident. It was better to be safe than sorry.
 He would fail as long as he was careless!
 Thinking of his past powerful enemies, who wasn’t confident that they had a backup plan and thought that they could defeat him?
 Hundreds of geniuses stood in front of the door and discussed.
 “Azure Heaven Mystic is indeed powerful. Unfortunately, Jiang Yi is stronger.” “What cultivation technique is that? It’s amazing. It’s even hotter than the Heavenly Dao Sun Star.”
 “However, the difference in cultivation level is too great. Otherwise, Azure Heaven Mystic might not have lost.”
 “Indeed.”
 “As expected of the Heavenly Sage’s disciples. These three are all Great Dao Sages. Tell me, how many Great Dao Sages are there in the Hidden Sect? Could it be that all the second-generation disciples are here?”
 “Hard to say. They’re all Sages, anyway.”
 The geniuses discussed.
 Dao Sovereign and Zhao Xuanyuan smiled.
 Lao Dan’s expression was very serious as he stared at Azure Heaven Mystic.
 The battle between Azure Heaven Mystic and Jiang Yi had already ended. At this moment, Azure Heaven Mystic was in a state of enlightenment.
 Ever since he had taken the Primordial Pill, his bloodline had long transformed with Lao Dan’s help. The Divine Yang Indestructible Body was no longer inferior to the Chaotic Fiendcelestial. In addition to the difference in cultivation realm, it was not surprising that he had defeated Azure Heaven Mystic.
 However, he actually felt a hint of danger during the battle.
 This kid was not simple!
 “The Heavenly Dao is lucky. Sigh!” Lao Dan sighed for the Three Pure Sacred World.
 ma
 Dao Sovereign smiled and asked, “How talented is this child in your eyes?”
 Lao Dan hesitated for a moment and said, “Other than the Divine Might Heavenly Sage, I think he can be ranked first. Even my master is far inferior.”
 The cultivation speed of the current juniors was something that the ancient existences did not dare to imagine in the past. Of course, this was also the reason why they had received the favor of their predecessors.
 In the past, the Dao Ancestor had to figure out the cultivation after attaining the Dao. Unlike the current geniuses, who already had the path paved for them and only needed to cultivate, there was no need to figure it out or seek opportunities. With the current status of the Heavenly Dao, there was an endless stream of cultivation resources. As long as they were geniuses, they only needed to cultivate and did not have to worry too much.
  Lao Dan’s words caused the geniuses to exclaim. So powerful?
 Dao Sovereign and Zhao Xuanyuan frowned. They would be furious if it were anyone else, but they were shocked since these words came from Lao Dan.
 There was actually such a prodigy in the Heavenly Dao!
 He was about to speak when a cold snort sounded behind him. “First place? I don’t think so. In my opinion, his potential is inferior to mine!”
 Everyone turned around with strange expressions.
 The person who spoke was the personal disciple of the Heavenly Dao Sage, Su Qi, Zhao Shuangquan.
 Zhao Shuangquan indeed had the right to be arrogant!
 However, Zhao Shuangquan represented the prodigies of the Hidden Sect, while Azure Heaven Mystic was a prodigy outside of the Heavenly Dao. Sparks would definitely fly when the two of them collided.
 Zhao Xuanyuan smiled and said, “Your potential is indeed impressive, but catch up to him first. If you can’t catch up to him no matter what, it will at most mean that your talent is similar. It’s impossible for you to be stronger.”


 “I will prove myself in the Chaotic Assembly!”
 Zhao Shuangquan snorted. His gaze landed on Azure Heaven Mystic, his eyes filled with fighting spirit.
 Azure Heaven Mystic had already taken turns to challenge Dao Sovereign and the other two. He was defeated without exception. The third battle was even more powerful, attracting many geniuses to watch.
 Although he had only seen Azure Heaven Mystic fight once, Zhao Shuangquan felt that his potential was stronger than the other party’s.
 What was an epiphany like this?
 How could he be the number one prodigy if he couldn’t surpass his opponent!
 Lao Dan sized him up and his gaze landed on Azure Heaven Mystic. He looked back and forth, thinking about something.
 On the other side.
 In the Heavenly Dao Palace.
  Zhou Fan, Fang Liang, Long Hao, Su Qi, Li Xuan’ao, and the other personal disciples gathered here.
 They were also watching Jiang Yi and Azure Heaven Mystic.
 Fang Liang sighed. “Time really passed quickly. The juniors have already caught up.”
 nce
 Li Xuan’ao stroked his beard and laughed.
 Su Qi said helplessly, “My disciple’s potential is indeed impressive, but he’s too arrogant deep down. Azure Heaven Mystic is known as the number one prodigy of the Heavenly Dao. The two of them will probably have many conflicts in the future. As their masters, we can’t forcefully stop them.”
 Zhou Fan nodded. “We can’t stop them forcefully. How can the elders interfere in the matters of the younger generation? It’s not a blood feud.”
 They began to recall the past.
 Long Hao said proudly, “The Heavenly Dao has so many geniuses now. Could the Chaotic Ten Absolutes be occupied by the Heavenly Dao?”
 Zhou Fan shook his head. “You can’t underestimate the Chaos. There are many peerless geniuses in the Chaos, unless they are all existences like Han Huang.”
 Everyone sighed at the mention of Han Huang
 Fortunately, Han Huang did not participate in the Hidden Sect Meeting this time. Otherwise, these geniuses would definitely be depressed. How could they dare to fight here?
 “The Hidden Sect Meeting was a good thing. It made the Hidden Sect disciples understand how strong this sect is. To be honest, even I was shocked. Especially the Black Hell Chicken and the others, they are actually all at ease. It’s simply ridiculous. There are more than fifty of them?” Zhou Fan was speechless.
 The others nodded.
 Li Xuan’ao smiled. “Sect Master is clearly secretly nurturing them. You have to be careful not to be left behind.”
 In the past, he was also the most talented among the Heavenly Emperor’s sons.
 However, the world changed as time passed. He was no longer an influential figure.
 Zhou Fan smiled and said, “Do you want to find your father? His Majesty is very glorious in the Chaos now. He has a Great Dao Sage as a Divine General. You have to know that there are only so many Great Dao Sages in the Chaos. If you can obtain one, you can be considered an overlord.”
 Long Hao shook his head and said helplessly, “The father and son relationship between us has long been severed. It was my fault back then. It’s fine not to mention it.”
 Speaking of what happened before the Heavenly Dao restarted, Su Qi’s expression was also a little unnatural.
 Killing all living beings was a sin he would never forget.
 They were not the only ones chatting. The other Sage Dao Fields were also lively
 тер
 Too many geniuses had returned from this Hidden Sect Meeting. It greatly stimulated the geniuses of the Heavenly Dao. This was a good thing for the Heavenly Dao.
 All the Sages felt the signs of a golden age and a world of strife.
 Han Huang’s consciousness slowly awakened. Memories surged like a tide, causing his head to ache.
 He opened his eyes and saw nothing but whiteness.
 He turned around with difficulty.
 Han Qing’er and Jiang Jueshi floated around. Not far away, the Carefree Immortal was meditating, his body surrounded by purple Qi.
 “What’s going on…”
 Han Huang’s expression changed. He was shocked to discover that his Dharmic powers were gone and his Great Dao Dao Fruit had been deprived. He was now like a mortal.
 He glared at Carefree Immortal and cursed. “Dog! What did you do?”
 Carefree Immortal opened his eyes and smiled teasingly. “Your natural potential is indeed very strong, far surpassing the Chaotic Fiendcelestials. Thank you for your help. I will bring your potential to greater heights.
 Carefree Immortal laughed wantonly, causing Han Huang’s eyes to turn red.
 Jiang Jueshi also woke up at this moment.
 His expression also changed drastically. He stared at Carefree Immortal and asked in a low voice, “What did you do to me?”
 Carefree Immortal smiled and said, “You have Innate Great Creation. Your Great Reincarnation Creation Technique already belongs to me. Coupled with the talent and creation of the two of you, I’m definitely invincible. How can that Divine Might Heavenly Sage be my match? I’m a Great Dao Supreme, to begin with. Give me time to fuse all your potential and I’ll definitely kill the Divine Might Heavenly Sage!”
 Jiang Jueshi’s expression darkened, but he did not curse like Han Huang.
 Cursing could only vent and was useless in the current situation.
  Carefree Immortal slowly stood up. He raised his hands and smiled. “Don’t be afraid. I won’t kill you. It’s just that the Divine Might Heavenly Sage has severed the path of invincibility and affected too many Supremes’ Dao attainment. He’s an anomaly that interferes with the karma and fate of the Chaos. He shouldn’t exist in the first place. I’ll return his potential and creation to you after I kill him.”
 Han Huang was furious. He glared at him. If looks could kill, Carefree Immortal’s body and soul would already be destroyed.
 Jiang Jueshi asked, “Return it to us? Then what is your goal? Is it just to take revenge on my master?”
 “He’s an anomaly. The Chaos will definitely collapse if we don’t eliminate him.”
 Han Huang cursed. “If not for my father, how could the Chaos be peaceful? That Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit and the Great Dao Divine Spirit are colluding. What will happen to the Chaos?”
 Carefree Immortal asked, “What will happen if the Heavenly Dao is stronger than the Chaos?”
 Han Huang was stunned.
 “He must die!”


 “That’s only your guess. According to you, you want to sacrifice all the living beings in the Heavenly Dao for the sake of saving the chaotic lifeforms? Do you think this is really righteous?” Jiang Jueshi stared at Carefree Immortal and asked coldly.
 Hearing this, Carefree Immortal laughed as if he had heard the most ridiculous thing in the world.
 “Only in the Chaos can there be righteousness. Don’t you understand what I just said? The Heavenly Dao is different from the Chaos. Heavenly Dao would have long been destroyed if not for the Dao Ancestor suppressing its development.”
 As the Carefree Immortal spoke, he shook his head and sighed. “How impressive was the Dao Ancestor back then? He single-handedly pulled up the Heavenly Dao and resisted the enemies of the Chaos many times. Unfortunately, in the end, he was still abandoned by everyone. Now that he has disappeared, who among the living beings in the Heavenly Dao remembers his kindness?
 “The Dao Ancestor is the same, so is the Divine Might Heavenly Sage.”
 Jiang Jueshi was silent.
 Han Huang cursed. “Even if you absorb my potential and creation, you’re not my father’s match. Just wait for death!”
 Carefree Immortal smiled. “Then let’s wait and see.”
 With that, he suddenly vanished.
  Only Jiang Jueshi, Han Huang, and Han Qing’er were left in the blank domain.
 Han Qing’er had yet to awaken.
 Han Huang wanted to move, but he discovered that he could only twist his body. This domain was too strange. He couldn’t borrow strength, and the Dharmic powers in his body were already gone.
 Jiang Jueshi was the same. He frowned and scanned his surroundings.
 He had never heard of such a place. He felt very uneasy.
 “He must know that we can’t escape if he dares to leave.”
 Jiang Jueshi sighed.
 Han Huang was extremely aggrieved and had nowhere to vent his anger.
 After a long while…
 Han Qing’er woke up and learned of this from her two brothers. She was very calm.
 “Second Brother, have you forgotten the Mystical Power Father taught us? Summon him now!” Han Qing’er said in a low voice with a mysterious expression.
 Han Huang’s expression darkened. “How can I have the face to summon him? I said that I would rely on myself, but… Besides, the other party is waiting to scheme against Father. Aren’t I falling into his trap?”
 Han Huang was silent.
 Jiang Jueshi said, “You can summon him before removing the Mystical Power. It’s equivalent to informing Master that something happened. Then, you can wait for Master to visit us in our dreams. Find out the reason first and then Master will make a decision.”
 Han Qing’er’s eyes lit up. Then, she ignored Han Huang and began to use the Invocation Technique.
 She severed the Mystical Power feed as soon as the black vortex formed.
 On the other side.
 Han Jue was actually a little hesitant. After all, the blank domain was very likely the hiding place of the Dao Creators.
 However, the black vortex disappeared very quickly.
 Han Jue immediately understood what the other party meant.
 It should not be interrupted.
 After Han Jue returned to the Daoist temple, he sent dreams from time to time but couldn’t succeed. He could try again now.
 He immediately sent a dream to Han Huang.
 As expected.
 He succeeded!
 The dream was a blank domain, hinting to Han Huang that Han Jue knew this place.
 However, Han Huang thought that the dream was his own thoughts, so he did not think too much about it.
 Seeing Han Jue, he looked ashamed and didn’t know what to say.
 Han Jue asked, “Who captured you? Do you know his name?”
 Han Huang shook his head. “He didn’t reveal his name.”
 “Show me his image.”
 Han Huang immediately waved his hand. In the dream, his Dharmic powers had recovered. In any case, it was all fake.
 Han Jue noted down the Carefree Immortal’s appearance.
 Seeing that Han Jue’s expression didn’t change, the grievance in Han Huang’s heart immediately turned into sadness. He then told him what had happened.
 His potential was the thing he was most proud of. He had been a genius since he was young. He didn’t dare to imagine what would happen if he became trash.
 That would be worse than death!
 Han Jue was a little surprised.
 Snatching people’s potential and stealing their opportunities!
 He even had an Ultimate Dao Treasure!
 It was indeed impressive.
 From low to high, Dharma treasures were respectively the Heavenly Dao Numinous Treasure, Heavenly Dao Supreme Treasure, Freedom Numinous Treasure, Freedom Supreme Treasure, Great Dao Numinous Treasure, Great Dao Supreme Treasure, Ultimate Dao Treasure, and Ultimate Supreme Treasure. Among them, Great Dao Dharma treasures could also be called Chaotic Dharma treasures.
 Han Jue also had an Ultimate Dao Treasure and an even stronger Ultimate Supreme Treasure.
 However, there were only a few Ultimate Dharma treasures in the Chaos. The Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit and the Primordial Ancestral God had never revealed them.
 This was a very good opponent!
 Han Jue asked, “What’s the other party’s cultivation level?”
 He was looking forward to it.
 It was also a good thing that an opponent had appeared during the boring cultivation years.
 It could motivate him and make his life interesting
 “What? Great Dao Supreme?”
 Han Jue’s eyes widened, scaring Han Huang.
 Han Jue muttered, “That’s it?”
 He was so excited for nothing!
 Han Jue looked at him and said, “Stay there. You’re outside the Chaos. It’s a blank domain. No living being can survive or cultivate in it. It just so happens that your potential has been deprived. You can reflect on it.
 “Not only do you need invincible potential, but you also need an invincible heart. Don’t let your cultivation enslave you. This is a training you must undergo.”
 Han Huang was deep in thought.
 The dream ended.
 Han Qing’er hurriedly asked when she saw that he woke up, “What did Father say?”
 Han Huang replied, “He said that this is a blank domain outside the Chaos, and he asked us to stay here for the time being and calm down. Treat it as training.”
 Jiang Jueshi smiled. “Since Master knows where we are, it means that he’s already confident.”
 Han Qing’er wailed. “Then how long are we going to stay here?”
 Han Huang did not say anything else and reflected on his father’s words.
 Heart of Invincibility!
 Don’t be enslaved by cultivation…
 Inside the Daoist temple.
 Han Jue opened his eyes. “I want to know if the person in my mind can be insta-killed by
 (1 trillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Han Jue hesitated.
 With this level…
 How disappointing!
 However, he still chose to continue when he thought of that mysterious Ultimate Dao Treasure.
 (Yes]
 The Carefree Immortal definitely didn’t know his true strength.
 (100 trillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 The cost had increased by a hundred times!
 This fellow was still a little stable. After obtaining the invincible potential and creation, he still endured until he was a hundred times stronger before attacking.
 What a pity!
 A hundred times was not enough!
 Continue!
 [Yes]
 Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief.
 He asked, “Where is this person?”
  (The other party has an Ultimate Dao Treasure that cannot be deduced.]
 How strange. He could deduce the cultivation level but not the location.
 It seemed that this Ultimate Dao Treasure was not simple.
 He would kill this fellow and grab the treasure when the time came.
 (100 trillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [No]
 Yes, this fellow was trustworthy.
 He was only targeting Han Jue and not lying to Han Huang and the other two.


 Han Jue thought for a moment and decided not to save Han Huang and the other two for the time being. Firstly, he wanted the mysterious enemy to let down his guard, and secondly, he wanted Han Huang and the other two to settle down.
 How could life be smooth sailing?
 If there was no major blow, how could he find his Dao heart?
 Han Jue closed his eyes and continued cultivating
 He would face two crises in the future!
 One was the mysterious person who had captured Han Huang and the other two.
 The second was the Chaotic Will that was about to make a move.
 He would really be invincible if he could even deal with the Chaos!
  As for the Dao Creator, he would think about it in the future!
 Ten thousand years after the Hidden Sect Meeting ended.
 The entire Heavenly Dao returned to normal. However, it was more lively and prosperous than before.
 Geniuses often battled. It made all living beings realize that the era of geniuses had arrived. Some busybodies even drew up the Genius Ranking
 Azure Heaven Mystic was undoubtedly ranked first.
 However, the second place constantly changed.
 The Sages also became busy. Fortunately, clones existed. With the current status of the Heavenly Dao, the Sages used clones to receive the Chaotic Guests, who felt that it was reasonable.
 Zhao Xuanyuan wanted to leave with Zhao Shuangquan, but he rejected him.
 Although Su Qi had accepted many disciples, only Zhao Shuangquan remained.
 The higher one’s cultivation level was, the more one understood.
 What Su Qi had done back then made his previous disciples feel guilty and stay away. In the circle of Sages, Su Qi had always been more solitary. Other than the Hidden Sect disciples, he rarely interacted with other Sages.
 Zhao Shuangquan had no parents since he was young. He only felt warmth after being accepted by Su Qi. His thoughts had been different from all living beings since he was young.
 He only recognized people who treated him well. As for the great kindness and righteousness that the mortal world recognized, he would never listen to them.
 On this day.
 In Su Qi’s Dao Field palace, the master and disciple were discussing the Genius Ranking.
 “Master, why is he the number one on the Genius Ranking? Shouldn’t the Genius Ranking look at battle achievements and potential? Just because his cultivation level is high? How old is he? He still has the cheek to stand at the top of the Genius Ranking. I think the Sages are creating hype for him!” Zhao Shuangquan said indignantly.
 In the Heavenly Dao, not to mention a million years, someone a hundred thousand years old was already old.
 Su Qi smiled. “Actually, Azure Heaven Mystic was also your fellow disciple in the past. He was even younger than you. Later, the Hidden Sect realized that he was too powerful and let him leave after he grew up. The Heavenly Dao also needed to show its face when participating in the Chaotic Assembly.
 “The Hidden Sect belongs to the Heavenly Dao, but the Heavenly Dao is the Heavenly Dao and the Hidden Sect is the Hidden Sect. You should understand this logic. So, behind Azure Heaven Mystic stands the entire Heavenly Dao, including the Hidden Sect.
 “Your potential is impressive, but you have to understand that nothing in this world is absolutely fair. The rules themselves are set.”
 Zhao Shuangquan curled his lips.
 That made sense, but he was still unhappy.
 Su Qi smiled and asked, “Disciple, what is your goal in the future? Fight for the title of number one prodigy?”
 Zhao Shuangquan immediately said, “Of course not. I want to be the strongest!”
 Su Qi smiled. “As strong as your Grandmaster?”
 Zhao Shuangquan nodded, his eyes filled with admiration.
 He had naturally heard of his grandmaster since he was young.
 Even if Su Qi destroyed the world and was consigned to eternal damnation, Grandmaster was willing to save him and ensure his safety.
 “If there’s a chance, I’ll introduce you to Master and ask him to let you cultivate beside him. It won’t be difficult for you to surpass Azure Heaven Mystic in the future.” Su Qi smiled with a loving expression as if he was facing his son.
 Zhao Shuangquan’s eyes lit up. He nodded crazily and immediately stood up to massage his legs and back.
 The master and disciple continued chatting.
 After entering his cultivation state, time passed extremely quickly for Han Jue.
 Another hundred thousand years passed in a flash.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and sent a dream to Su Qi.
 Su Qi had sent him a dream ten thousand years ago, but he was cultivating, so he ignored it.
 He could see at a glance that Su Qi was still in the Heavenly Dao, so he was not worried that his life was in danger.
 Su Qi opened his eyes and immediately bowed when he saw that it was him.
 Han Jue said, “What is it?”
 Su Qi immediately told him.
 He was here for Zhao Shuangquan.
 He hoped that Han Jue could guide him. It would be even better if he could let him cultivate by his side.
 “This is only a request. It’s fine if you’re unwilling,” Su Qi added.
 Han Jue remained silent.
 It would be fine if it was any other disciple, but the other party was Zhao Shuangquan, the reincarnation of the Eighth Chaos. If he brought him to the Dao Field, would the Ninth Chaos rely on Zhao Shuangquan to infiltrate the Dao Field?
 Too dangerous. He had to consider it.
 However, Su Qi rarely looked for him, so he naturally could not refuse. “How about this? Let him cultivate in peace. I’ll teach him a Mystical Power in his dreams,” Han Jue said in a low voice.
 Su Qi was pleasantly surprised and hurriedly thanked him. At the same time, he heaved a sigh of relief.
 He was also worried that his master would refuse.
 Han Jue smiled and said, “You have to cultivate diligently. The Freedom Realm is not enough.”
 Su Qi was a Chaotic Fiendcelestial. After so many years, it was naturally not surprising that he had attained Freedom. Han Jue even felt that he was a little lazy.
 After all, Su Qi had obtained the Chaotic Fiendcelestial bloodline earlier than the other disciples. He should have attained the Great Dao by now.
 “I’ve disappointed Master. Don’t worry, I’ll definitely attain the Great Dao.” Su Qi hurriedly promised. In front of Han Jue, his attitude was very humble and nervous, unlike his cold attitude when facing the geniuses.
 The master and disciple chatted for a while before the dream ended.
Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎 Han Jue started to check his emails. His circle of friends became lively again. Dao Sovereign, Zhou Fan, and the other disciples began to cause trouble again. Needless to say, without them wandering in the Chaos, Han Jue’s circle of friends would have much less fun.
 Han Jue sent a dream to Han Qing’er after reading the emails.
  The dream was the third Dao Field.
 Han Qing’er was pleasantly surprised to see him. She hurriedly pounced into his arms and wailed.
 “Father! You’re finally here!”
 Han Jue’s heart throbbed upon hearing his daughter’s cries.
 Was he too strict with her? How uneasy had she been all these years? Would he regret it if she accidentally died?
 “You’re already a few million years old, but you still act like a little girl,” Han Jue said helplessly.
 Han Qing’er curled her lips. “I’ll always be your daughter no matter how old I am!”
 Han Jue smiled and asked about the recent situation.
 Han Huang and the other two had been exiled to the blank domain. The Carefree Immortal did appear again after he left. No existence had disturbed them in the past hundred thousand years. They floated in the blank domain alone and remained unchanged.


 “Do you want me to fetch you?” Han Jue asked. A hundred thousand years was enough.
 He couldn’t do anything but ask.
 Han Qing’er chuckled. “There’s no need for that. I’m just acting cute with you. We’re not in danger for the time being. Furthermore, Second Brother and Senior Jiang are breaking through after breaking down.”
 “Oh? Breakthrough? Tell me in detail,” Han Jue asked curiously. He only wanted Han Huang to settle down. He didn’t expect the two of them to be able to find a cultivation technique.
 This was a pleasant surprise!
 Han Qing’er said, “Although Second Brother’s potential was snatched, he regained his bloodline after ten thousand years. His bloodline seems to be able to regenerate. As for Senior Jiang, he suddenly said one day that his Great Creation had returned after staying there for about thirty thousand years.”
 Han Jue was interested.
 It was fine if it was just Han Huang. After all, he was a Primordial Fiendcelestial. The Primordial Fiendcelestial had surpassed the Chaotic Fiendcelestial. It was not unreasonable for its bloodline to be reborn.
 But what was with Jiang Jueshi?
  Great Creation could be reborn?
 “Summon me when your captor appears,” Han Jue said.
 Han Huang and Jiang Jueshi recovered their potential. If the other party sensed it, they might use these two to create a force with unlimited potential.
 This was not good!
 Han Jue disdained the other party in a one-on-one battle.
 However, if the other party used this opportunity to constantly scheme, there was no need to wait. It was best to eliminate them as soon as possible to prevent things from getting out of hand.
 “Alright!”
 Han Qing’er agreed.
 The father and daughter did not say anything else. Soon, the dream ended.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and asked in his mind, “Can Jiang Jueshi’s Great Creation be infinitely deprived and recovered?”
 (1 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 How expensive!
 Continue!
 [No]
 Han Jue felt that this was reasonable.
 Otherwise, wouldn’t that mysterious existence be able to constantly create Great Creation bearers like Jiang Jueshi?
 “Tsk tsk, this disciple is impressive. His future is limitless!”
 Han Jue sighed. He was suddenly interested.
 “I want to know what Jiang Jueshi will be like at his peak?” Han Jue asked in his mind.
 (i quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 So expensive!
 Dao Creator?
 Han Jue was shocked. Unlike the previous question, this question represented cultivation.
 Since ancient times, there had only been five Dao Creators. None of the Chaotic Fiendcelestials had succeeded!
 Apart from being born with great providence, Jiang Jueshi was also an ordinary living being.
 Ever since Han Huang was born, Han Jue didn’t pay so much attention to Jiang Jueshi. Now, Han Huang had even surpassed him.
 He didn’t expect that the future Jiang Jueshi would be stronger than Han Huang!
 Han Jue chose to continue.
 His consciousness entered the illusion.
 He opened his eyes and saw a bright mountain gate. In front of him was a long staircase as white as jade. Along the hill, tens of thousands of steps above was the peak of the mountain. A golden-white throne with nine golden dragons wrapped around it could be seen. It was a majestic sight.
 This was an island floating in the air.
 Outside was a blank domain. Countless corpses floated, forming a huge circle that surrounded the empty island.
 “Blank domain? He’s indeed a Dao Creator.”
  Han Jue thought silently.
 Chaotic living beings could not survive in the blank domain.
 He looked up and saw that the golden-white throne above the ten thousand steps was extremely majestic. A figure was meditating on it. Compared to the throne, the size was extremely strange.
 Jiang Jueshi!
 Han Jue looked at Jiang Jueshi and discovered that this fellow was very similar to the future Han Huang. He was high and mighty and his arrogance was about to soar.
 At this moment, a figure appeared above Han Jue. To be precise, it was a head.
 This head had disheveled hair and nine eyes. It was as big as a mountain range and was filled with pressure.
 Han Jue was secretly shocked.
 This terrifying aura could only be the Dao Creator.
 The nine-eyed head smiled and said, “The danger of the Chaos has been resolved according to you. That anomaly has been destroyed by the will of all living beings.”
 Jiang Jueshi opened his eyes and smiled. “Oh? Just like how you treated my master back then? The so-called will of all living beings is really ridiculous.”
 The nine-eyed head said, “The past is like smoke and mist. You should understand this logic now that you can already control the will of all living beings. Existence is the meaning. Everything that doesn’t exist is meaningless. In our realms, what are the past and morals? Everything is meaningless in front of us.”
 Jiang Jueshi did not reply as if he tacitly agreed.
 Han Jue raised his eyebrows.
 This future was the future after he was killed by the Chaotic Will?
 Oh!
 Then this future could not exist.
 Han Jue calmed down and watched the show.
 Jiang Jueshi said again, “No one can touch Han Huang’s son. Otherwise, I will destroy the Chaos even if I have to offend the Ninth Chaos.”
 The nine-eyed head smiled. “We Dao Creators will not target a specific living being. Not even the Primordial Fiendcelestial. You can rest assured.”
 Jiang Jueshi closed his eyes.
 The nine-eyed head smiled and disappeared.
 The illusion shattered.
 Han Jue’s consciousness returned to reality.
 He opened his eyes and fell into deep thought.
 Although the illusion was short, it was enough to show that the Dao Creator was very respectful to Jiang Jueshi.
 However, their words made him vigilant.
 He might die!
 He died under the schemes of the Chaotic Will!
 The Chaotic Will controlled everyone’s will!
 Han Jue’s eyes changed and his Dao heart stabilized.
 No one can kill me!
 Not even the will of all living beings!
 In the palace of the Dao Field.
 Azure Heaven Mystic was cultivating.
  He suddenly opened his eyes upon hearing footsteps. He stood up and asked in a low voice, “What are you doing!”
 The Carefree Immortal wore a white robe and was surrounded by a purple aura. He was rather sinister.
 Carefree Immortal smiled and said, “Don’t be nervous. Don’t worry. I’ve already isolated this palace. No one can hear our conversation.”
 Azure Heaven Mystic was furious. “Let’s not talk nonsense. If you want to fight, fight! I can’t be with you, much less deal with the Divine Might Heavenly Sage with you!”
 Hearing this, the Carefree Immortal was still calm as he smiled and said, “The Divine Might Heavenly Sage will definitely die. If you participate, you will have great merit and your name will spread throughout the Chaos.”
 Azure Heaven Mystic cursed. “Get lost. You want me to deal with the Divine Might Heavenly Sage? Isn’t that treachery?”
 He immediately waved his palm, but the Carefree Immortal suddenly appeared in front of him and grabbed his wrist before his arm could straighten.
 Azure Heaven Mystic widened his eyes.
 Carefree Immortal smiled. “I forgot to tell you. My cultivation level has already surpassed the Chaos. No one in the entire Chaos is my match, including the Divine Might Heavenly Sage. It’s just that I’m Carefree and it’s not convenient for me to personally take action. In addition, even if you refuse, soon, all living beings will eliminate the Divine Might Heavenly Sage. You will, too, at that time. Perhaps you can’t understand now, but this is the truth. I only think highly of you, so I’ll give you a chance. “Choosing to do it and being forced to do it are two different things.”
