 Han Jue helped Qin Ling refine 99 Emperor Essence Pills, almost making him kneel down.
 He couldn’t understand this alchemy technique.
 This was because the herbs he had prepared could only be refined a hundred times. According to the 10% success rate, Liu Bei’s alchemy technique was almost 100% successful.
 The only time he failed was when Han Jue stopped in time.
 In the courtyard, Qin Ling began to massage Han Jue’s back and shoulders, trying his best to please him.
 “Brother, what do you want to eat and drink? Just tell me!”
 “You’re my big brother from now on!”
  “Take 60% of these pills. You can’t give me all of them!”
 “Are you really giving them to me? I…”
 “So you don’t need it. Alright.”
 Qin Ling was overjoyed after accepting all the Emperor Essence Pills. He had never been so happy in the past hundred thousand years.
 His gaze softened as he looked at Han Jue.
 He was his benefactor.
 “Brother, you’ve helped me so much. What do you need me to do?” Qin Ling asked.
 He would really feel uneasy if he did not repay him.
 Han Jue smiled and said, “I want the most precious treasure in the world. Can you help me find it?”
 Qin Ling asked in surprise, “What is that?”
 “You will understand in the future.”
 Qin Ling was deep in thought. Little did he know that Han Jue was just patronizing him.
 Qin Ling thought that it was a Dharma treasure. Most of the treasures in the Immortal World were Dharma treasures.
 Han Jue left several days later.
 Qin Ling began to consume the Emperor Essence Pills in seclusion.
 In the next few decades, Han Jue traveled the Immortal World and saw its current prosperity. The cultivation culture filled every corner of the world. Even mortal villages knew at least one cultivation method.
 If not for the Chaotic Heavenly Road and the fact that all living beings did not explore the Chaos, the Immortal World would have long been saturated. It would be a disaster when resources and territory became limited and the number of cultivators continued to increase.
 Netherworld.
 Han Jue came to Han Xinyuan’s residence.
 Han Xinyuan had inherited his and Han Tuo’s good looks. Wearing a white robe, she was the only one in the room as she silently and lonely meditated.
 Han Jue calculated and discovered that Han Xinyuan had very little karma, even less than Han Yu. She had been alone for a million years. It was even more so after entering the netherworld. Although she held great power, she had been cultivating alone most of the time.
 This was the first time the two of them met. Although they were related by blood, Han Xinyuan didn’t know of his existence at all. Han Tuo and Yang Tiandong didn’t say anything, either. After all, Han Jue’s status was too high. They didn’t want to burden Han Xinyuan and cause great karma, which would also reduce trouble for Han Jue.
 Ten years later.
 Han Jue left quietly.
 Han Xinyuan opened her beautiful eyes and frowned.
 Han Jue’s Dao heart was calm again after the hundred years of travel ended.
 He came to the second Dao Field.
 Li Yao and Dao Comprehension Sword opened their eyes. They hurriedly stood up and bowed upon seeing him appear.
 Han Jue sat down and started to preach the Dao. His voice resounded throughout the second Dao Field.
 A hundred years later, the lecture ended.
 Han Jue was about to leave.
 “Sister, go out for a while,” Li Yao suddenly said.
 Dao Comprehension Sword was stunned for a moment before leaving obediently.
Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m Li Yao pulled him back.
 Han Jue remained silent and sat beside her.
 Twenty years later.
 Han Jue returned to the main Dao Field and prepared to continue cultivating.
 [Detected that the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority has been triggered. The Divine Authority Generals will monitor the entire Chaos. You have the following choices:)
 (1: Exit seclusion immediately and destroy the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority. You will obtain a Great Dao Fragment, a Creation Spirit Stone, a Heavenly Dao Spirit Stone, a Supreme Treasure, a Mystical Power inheritance, and a new function of the system.]
 [2: Cultivate in a low-profile manner and ignore this matter for the time being. You will obtain a Great Dao Fragment, a Creation Spirit Stone, and a chance to upgrade the Dao Field.]
 Great Dao Providence Divine Authority?
 A word appeared in his mind when Han Jue saw the first option.
 Scam!
 The second option caused his eyes to light up.
 Upgrade the Dao Field!
 It could still level up?
 Han Jue directly chose the second option.
 Nothing was more important than safety.
 (You chose to cultivate in a low-profile manner and obtained a Great Dao Fragment, a Creation Spirit Stone, and a chance to upgrade the Dao Field.)
 [The Dao Field has begun to upgrade.]
 Han Jue took out the Creation Spirit Stone and fused it with one of the Fiendcelestial Qi.
 Then, he placed his attention on the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority.
 “I want to know how the Divine Authority Generals will monitor the Chaos?” Han Jue asked in his mind. It had been a long time since the system had triggered such a choice. This meant that this matter was not simple and even involved his life.
 (1 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [The Great Dao Providence Divine Authority will create ten thousand Divine Authority Generals. They will check every corner of the Chaos and search for dangerous elements that might threaten the Chaos and eliminate them.]
 Han Jue frowned.
 This was not good!
 “Do my son and I have a way to avoid the inspection of the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority?” Han Jue continued to ask in his mind.
 (1 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [No]
 Han Jue frowned. “Even the Dao Field can’t avoid it?”
 [The Dao Field can resist, but it cannot avoid detection. It will be treated as a danger factor and will be attacked by ten thousand Divine Authority Generals.]
 That was good.
 It meant that the Divine Authority Generals would target the Dao Field, but they might not be able to break in.
 However, the consequences would be unimaginable if this matter blew up.
 Han Jue asked, “How strong are the Divine Authority Generals?”
 (1 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?)
 Continue!
 (A Divine Authority General is equivalent to a Great Dao Sage.]
 Ten thousand Great Dao Sages?
 Han Jue’s eyes widened and he stood up.
 How could he block this calamity?
 Han Jue frowned.
 This Great Dao Providence Divine Authority was equivalent to the immunity system of the human body?
 It had to be said that this power was too domineering. No force in the Chaos could resist it. It would definitely be a slaughter.
 Any existence who faced such a force would either die or obediently wait for their inspection to end.
 He definitely couldn’t stop it with the current strength of the Heavenly Dao. The Dao Field was also in the Heavenly Dao and might endanger it.
 The Heavenly Dao had finally developed until now, but Han Jue still didn’t want to implicate it and all living beings.
 “I want to know if the ten thousand Divine Authority Generals will act together or separately?”
 [Together.]
  No lifespan was deducted, but the answer was the worst.
 “When will the ten thousand Divine Authority Generals reach the Heavenly Dao?”
 (1 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 (5 million years.]
 Han Jue’s brows suddenly relaxed.
 The situation was not that bad!
 After all, the Chaos was extremely vast. How could they sweep through the entire Chaos in a short period of time?


 “But then again, won’t they be able to hide everywhere if ten thousand Divine Authority Generals act together? They aren’t strict enough, or do they have special methods?”
 Han Jue thought silently.
 He did not use the derivation function. He had already checked. He couldn’t escape this disaster at all. Why waste his lifespan?
 Han Jue adjusted his state of mind and started cultivating
 He wanted to attain the Great Dao Supreme Realm before the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority attacked!
 Otherwise, he would not feel safe!
 It was not so easy for Han Jue to fight two thousand Foolish Sword Sages alone, let alone ten thousand Divine Authority Generals.
  Huang Zuntian was meditating and cultivating in a pool of water in the mysterious space.
 A figure appeared by the pool.
 “Huang Zuntian, have you thought about it?” the mysterious figure asked with a hoarse voice.
 Huang Zuntian opened his eyes and asked, “Do I have a choice?”
 Huang Zuntian was silent.
 The mysterious figure continued, “The Chaos has existed for too long. The current Chaos is still deathly silent. It has wasted space and everything we have now. Everything is because of those Great Dao Sages and Great Dao Divine Spirits. They are afraid that all living beings will surpass them. They are afraid that they can’t control the Chaotic Order, so they always restrict the development of the Chaos. What Life has to do is overturn everything and create an unprecedented new era. Can you imagine the prosperity of the Heavenly Dao appearing in every corner of the Chaos?
 “That’s what Life pursues!
 “Before that, all the casualties caused by the battle are worth it. You should understand!”
 Huang Zuntian took a deep breath and asked, “Can I meet the leader?”
 The mysterious figure said, “Life has no leader. Every Life is equal!”
 Huang Zuntian raised his eyebrows and asked, “Someone has to give orders, right?”
 The mysterious figure was silent.
 Huang Zuntian cursed silently. Trying to trick me?
 “You have to show your value if you want to see Master,” the mysterious figure said.
 “You’re right. There’s indeed no need for me to continue to contribute if the Heavenly Dao doesn’t save me. It would be best if Life made me stronger. Since I’ve joined Life, I don’t want to be cannon fodder. Of course, I have to show my value if I want to obtain power and status. You’re responsible for receiving me. I’ll definitely remember your kindness if I soar in the future.”
 His tone was sincere, and the mysterious figure was moved.
 “Alright, I’ll go ask first. Continue cultivating.”
 “Thank you, Fellow Daoist!”
 The mysterious figure vanished.
 Heavenly Court, Numinous Palace.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor sat on the Emperor’s throne and flipped through the jade slip on the table. The jade slip opened and he scanned it. A large amount of information surged into his mind. These jade slips contained restrictions and contained a huge amount of information that mortals could not imagine.
 Black Heaven General suddenly entered the hall and cupped his fists. “Your Majesty, the two candidates have arrived. Do you want to see them?”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor replied, “Let them in.”
 Only one of the three Divine Generals of the Heavenly Court was left ever since Han Tuo and Yi Tian left.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor had already screened many Heavenly Generals, but he was still not satisfied.
 Soon, two figures walked into the hall and knelt in front of him.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor sized them up. He was slightly satisfied, but he still felt some regret.
 “I’ll let you try first. I’ll give you a million Heavenly troops to take down this world in ten thousand years!”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor threw out a jade slip, and one of the Divine Generals hurriedly caught it.
 “Black Heaven General, bring them down.”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor waved his hand. The Black Heaven General immediately accepted the order. After the three of them left, the Evil Heavenly Emperor looked at the empty Numinous Palace and was lost in thought.
 He suddenly missed the scene of Yi Tian arguing in the hall.
 The Numinous Palace was too quiet without him.
  He was always worried when giving missions without Han Tuo.
 No!
 He still had to choose the prodigy of providence!
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor’s eyes flickered as his thoughts drifted to the Heavenly Dao.
 Time passed quickly.
 Fifty thousand years passed quickly. The Dao Field was finally successfully upgraded. The various Qi in the main Dao Field and the second Dao Field began to increase majestically.
 [The Dao Field has been upgraded. The array formation has been upgraded to the Creator Lord-level. The space inside the Dao Field has been expanded.]
 [Dao Field Immortal Qi has increased by ten times. Connate Qi has increased by ten times.)
 [The Dao Field can block all prying eyes.]
 Han Jue opened his eyes and looked at the information in front of him.
 Creator Lord-level?
 There was a realm above the Dao Creator?
 Han Jue frowned. He couldn’t help but ask in his mind, “Is there a Creator Lord in the current Chaos?”
 [9 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?)
 Continue!
 [Not for the time being.]
 Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief.
 In that case, the ceiling of the Chaos was the Dao Creator Realm. In other words, from today onwards, no existence could barge into his Dao Field?
 Han Jue was overwhelmed with joy.
 An unprecedented sense of security surged into his heart.
 No!
 Steady!
 “I want to know if there is anyone in the current Chaos who can break through the Dao Field?”
 (1 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [No]
 “Can the Dao Field be broken through?”
 (i quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 (You can be controlled by the enemy and made to destroy the Dao Field yourself.]
 Han Jue: “…”
Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m But it was indeed possible on second thought!
 Perhaps those mysterious and powerful existences could take advantage of his carelessness to control his consciousness.
 It was not impossible!
 Han Jue secretly noted this down. He couldn’t let his guard down even if there was an absolutely defensive Dao Field.
 Although the Dao Field had been upgraded again, it only expanded the internal space and couldn’t cover the entire Heavenly Dao. Otherwise, Han Jue could directly protect the Heavenly Dao.
 What a pity.
 No matter what, Han Jue was very happy.
 Five million years later, he could still hide here even if he couldn’t defeat ten thousand Divine Authority Generals!
  It would be fine even if he exposed his Primordial Fiendcelestial identity!
 At most, I’ll wait until I reach the Dao Creator Realm and kill all the enemies!
 Han Jue felt that he was already invincible.
 But he couldn’t be arrogant!
 Han Jue immediately started the simulation trial and challenged the ten thousand Foolish Sword Sages.
 He was tortured.
 Han Jue’s eyes became clear and he became restrained after he ended the simulation trial.
 Thank you, Foolish Sword Sage.


 The millions of disciples in the Hundred Peak Immortal River were very excited and overjoyed after the Dao Field was successfully upgraded.
 “I didn’t expect the Spirit Qi in our Dao Field to increase!”
 “Too exaggerated, but it’s about the same.”
 “Sect Master is really powerful. The Spirit Qi in the Sage Dao Field is probably not as dense as ours.”
 “Nonsense. Aren’t we in the Sage Dao Field?”
 They knew the truth better.
 This meant that Han Jue had another breakthrough
 The Black Hell Chicken sighed. “How high is Master’s cultivation level? He can still break through constantly. Previously, he could kill a Great Dao Sage. We can’t catch up even if we cultivate with all our might.”
 The Chaotic Heavenly Dog nodded desperately.
 The other personal disciples laughed and chatted.
 Xun Chang’an couldn’t help but think of the personal disciples who had gone out to train.
 He suddenly found it funny.
 You guys have worked hard to explore the world. We might even have surpassed you when you return.
 Every time they heard Zhou Fan, Jiang Yi, and the others bragging in the Myriad Worlds Projection, they were very envious, but they knew this.
 These guys only chose to talk about good things. They definitely had more bad experiences!
 The others rolled their eyes at him. He really knew how to brag.
 However, they quickly quietened down and focused on cultivating.
 They should work harder!
 On the other side.
 Han Jue began to check his emails. He hadn’t read them for a long time and didn’t know how his friends were doing. [Your good friend Yi Tian has learned a Great Dao Mystical Power. His cultivation has increased greatly.)
 (Your good friend Huang Zuntian was attacked and was severely injured.)
 (Your good friend Li Daokong was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure.] [Your good friend Shi Dudao was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure.]
 (Your son Han Tuo was attacked by a mysterious demon) x987432
 (Your grand-disciple Chu Shiren created three thousand Buddhist Dao techniques. His providence has increased.]
 [Your disciple Dao Sovereign was attacked by the Magus Race] x8204322
 [Your disciple Zhao Xuanyuan…]
 There had been fewer opportunities and more battles recently.
 It was normal for things to be chaotic occasionally. They could remain calm.
 He continued reading. Few emails were worth stopping and looking at.
 An email attracted him just as he was about to reach the end.
 (Your good friend Huang Zuntian has absorbed the providence of the Calamity Life Controller and obtained a trace of the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority.)
 The Great Dao Providence Divine Authority could be absorbed?
 Han Jue showed a frown.
 From the current situation, the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority was the Supreme Rule of the Chaos and also its foundation.
Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m The Great Dao Providence Divine Authority would be triggered when the Chaos was in danger.
 Didn’t that mean that the Chaos would be destroyed once the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority was destroyed?
 Han Jue asked silently, “Will the Dao Field be affected if the Chaos is destroyed?”
 (No. The Dao Field exists independently.]
 His lifespan was not even deducted. It could be seen that the system was very confident.
 Han Jue was relieved now.
 No wonder when he deduced the future, the existence that was seemingly himself wanted to destroy the Chaos and create the Primordial Chaos.
 Perhaps one day, he would want to create the supreme Primordial Universe when the Chaos made him tired of it.
 It was not impossible.
 Han Jue had never been an absolutely kind and righteous person, let alone now. It was only because he was too weak.
 Han Jue continued cultivating after reading the emails.
 This was how time passed. He had always been cultivating.
 Fifty thousand years passed in the blink of an eye.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and prepared to go to the 33rd Heaven. Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du was summoning him again.
 He was about to stand up when a message popped up.
 [Yang Che has developed hatred towards you. Current Hatred Points: 2 stars]
 What the hell?
 Han Jue’s heart tightened. He checked his interpersonal relationships and quickly found Yang Che’s profile picture. (Yang Che: Early-stage Heavenly Dao Sage, Immeasurable Emperor, disciple of the Jie School. He is dissatisfied with you because Sect Master Tian Jue flattered you too much. Current Hatred Points: 2 stars]
 You scared me!
 Han Jue was unhappy that he was actually frightened by a Heavenly Dao Sage. He immediately moved into the Universal Hall.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du immediately sent a voice transmission to the other Sages upon seeing him appear.
 South Extreme Heavenly Venerate, Sect Master Tian Jue, Emperor Xiao, Heavenly Venerate Wufa, Qiu Xilai, Fang Liang, Jin Shen, Pan Xin, Xu Dudao, Su Qi, Li Taigu, Primordial Chaos Buddha, Zhang Guxing, Long Hao, Ji Xianshen, Divine Might Buddha, and Yang Che all arrived.
 Han Jue saw that Yang Che’s expression was arrogant. He was a true prodigy.
 Yang Che bowed to him and introduced himself. On the surface, he still gave Han Jue enough face.
 Han Jue looked at the Heavenly Dao Sages. Unknowingly, the Sages of the Heavenly Dao were already so powerful. It was normal for a new Sage to be dissatisfied with him. Han Jue couldn’t be bothered to bicker with Yang Che. It couldn’t be helped. Sages were no different from ants in his eyes. Throwing Yang Che into the Primordial Heavenly Prison was even a waste of his time.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du looked at Li Taigu and said, “You can speak first.”
 Li Taigu nodded. When all the Sages’ gazes landed on him, he said, “Something happened in the Chaos!”
 Han Jue almost rolled his eyes.
 Heavenly Venerate Wufa lost his temper and cursed, “What are you waiting for! Just say it!”
 He also looked dissatisfied.
  Li Taigu smiled and continued, “The Three Pure Ones of the past have reunited. Originally, the Heavenly Sect Master escaped from the Ancient Desolate and was hunted down by Life. Later, Laozi took action. After that, the Heavenly Lord of Primordial Beginning announced that the Three Pure Ones would gather again and open up the Three Pure Sacred World to create a Sacred World for the cultivators of the Dao Sect to avoid the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity. All cultivators of the Dao Sect can enter. Some time ago, Life attacked the Three Pure Sacred World and returned in failure. Laozi killed five Lives with one strike, shocking the Chaos!
 “The Three Pure Ones are the first generation Sages of the Heavenly Dao. Pangu’s essence soul transformed into the Three Pure Ones. They are also the personal disciples of the Dao Ancestor. Where are the Dao Sect cultivators in the Chaos from? Naturally from our Heavenly Dao. The Three Pure Sacred World wants to poach the Heavenly Dao!”
 The Human School was established by Laozi.
 The Sages were moved.
 The new Sages also frowned. In the past, they might have joined the Three Pure Sacred World, but it was different now. They were already Sages and the masters of the Heavenly Dao. In their opinion, the actions of the Three Pure Sacred World were offensive.
 Heavenly Venerate Wufa looked at Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du and said, “Isn’t that your teacher? Don’t you know about this?”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “I indeed don’t know. I’ve actually been in contact with Teacher after the Heavenly Dao severed karma with the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End. My information came from Teacher’s Dharma idol, but I’ve never been able to guess Teacher’s thoughts.”


 “I hereby declare that my heart will exist forever with the Heavenly Dao. I will definitely draw a clear line with Teacher if he wants to harm the Heavenly Dao,” Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said solemnly as he scanned all the Sages.
 This sentence was also a warning to them.
 Ever since the Great Dao Sages in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End expressed goodwill to the Heavenly Dao, the Heavenly Dao had been close to their world. Perhaps someone was very close to the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End.
 Xu Dudao, Li Taigu, Zhang Guxing, and the other new Sages nodded.
 In their opinion, they couldn’t be killed even if they could not defeat a Great Dao Sage!
  Why should they be afraid?!
 Primordial Chaos Buddha smiled. “How can we be bewitched by the outside world with such a powerful Heavenly Dao?”
 Looking at the new Sages, they shook their heads and laughed, but they did not say anything
 This was also a good thing. The more they knew, the more afraid they would be. They might even rebel!
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “That’s right. We can accept any move if the Three Pure Sacred World wants to target the Heavenly Dao! We won’t reject anyone! The current Heavenly Dao is no longer the weak Heavenly Dao from back then!”
 For a time, the atmosphere in the Universal Hall eased.
 “We can’t just wait. We have to think of a way to deal with it. We should make a decision now that the Chaotic Lifeforms want to join the Heavenly Dao,” Pan Xin said.
 The current Heavenly Dao had always sent cultivators out and did not recruit other living beings.
 It was mainly because the Heavenly Dao was extremely exclusive. Without the providence and karma of the Heavenly Dao, one could not enter without permission. If one forcefully entered, they would be squeezed by the providence, such as being unable to cultivate in the Heavenly Dao.
 Fang Liang said, “Of course, the center of the Chaos. We won’t be caught by the enemy as long as we continue to grow!”
 “That’s right. How can we let this go?”
 “I also support openness.”
 “Let them in. It’s a good opportunity to open up more mortal worlds.”
 “I agree.”
 The other Sages spoke one after another. None of them retorted.
 It was mainly because the Heavenly Dao had only risen for a million years. The Sages did not encounter any major obstacles. They were all in high spirits and were still sharp.
 Han Jue had no objections. Thus, the matter was settled.
 In the end, the South Extreme Heavenly Venerate was chosen to be in charge of this matter. He would make a great wish and create a Holy Land that especially gave the providence of the Heavenly Dao to the Chaotic Lifeforms. They had to stay in that Holy Land for a period of time if they wanted to fuse with the Heavenly Dao.
 Yes, it sounded like a household registration program.
 The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate secretly heaved a sigh of relief. He was very excited.
 He had long seen the situation of the Heavenly Dao. He had never submitted to Han Jue and thought that the benefits wouldn’t fall on him.
 He looked at Han Jue gratefully, thinking that it was his intention.
 Han Jue was baffled but still nodded slightly at him.
 The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate was even more excited, but he restrained himself very well.
 The other Sages caught their actions. The new Sages let their imagination run wild and the old Sages were enlightened.
 The seemingly harmonious Universal Hall was secretly filled with excitement.
 Han Jue didn’t think too much, and there was no need to.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du spoke of the second matter. “I heard that a living being consumed the Primordial Pill and triggered the Supreme Rule of the Chaos. The Supreme Rule will transform into ten thousand Divine Authority Generals to monitor the entire Chaos. I wonder when it will arrive at the Heavenly Dao. This news has already spread in the Chaos. What do you think?”
 Emperor Xiao asked, “How? To enter the Heavenly Dao?”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “Of course.”
  Most Sages did not want Sages or existences beyond Sages to enter the Heavenly Dao to prevent anything bad from happening.
 After discussing for an hour, the Sages reached a consensus that they could not let the Divine Authority Generals enter the Heavenly Dao.
 Han Jue laughed secretly.
 There are ten thousand Great Dao Sages, can you stop them?
 Han Jue didn’t say it directly, afraid that he would scare the Sages. Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du’s information was clearly flawed, but that was normal. Very few living beings knew matters that involved the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority.
 There were still more than four million years to go. Han Jue could tell the Heavenly Dao Sages when the time came.
 There was no need to panic.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du looked at him and said, “The twelve Ancestral Magi have visited the Heavenly Dao. I’m afraid they have ill intentions. At that time, Fellow Daoist Han has to appear. After all, Di Jiang and Zhu Jiuyin are Great Dao Sages. The other Ancestral Magi are also Freedom Sages.”
 Twelve Ancestral Magi?
 Han Jue thought for a moment and then said, “Alright.”
 The new Sages couldn’t help but look forward to the arrival of the twelve Ancestral Magi. They mainly wanted to see how powerful Han Jue was.
 In the past, the battle ended too quickly when the Divine Robe Daoist attacked, including the Sages. They only knew that Han Jue was very strong. As for how strong, they didn’t have any deep sensation.
 Just like that, the discussion ended.
 Han Jue stood up and left.
 Han Jue nodded. Pan Xin probably had something on.
 The two of them left.
 Although the other Sages were curious, they did not ask.
 In the Pangu Hall.
 Han Jue and Pan Xin sat opposite each other. Pan Xin said worriedly, “I didn’t want to alarm you, but I’m really indignant. My Heaven-Opening Axe was stolen!”
 Heaven-Opening Axe?
 Han Jue showed a frown.
 Pan Xin’s Heaven-Opening Axe was very powerful. It had left a deep impression on Han Jue back then. It was not a good thing for such a Supreme Treasure to fall into Life’s hands.
 “Do you know who stole it?” Han Jue asked.
 Pan Xin gritted his teeth and said, “It should be Ancestor Xitian! Among the Lives that have appeared near the Chaotic Heavenly Road recently, Ancestor Xitian is the most frequent. Furthermore, he’s very strong and has the ability to directly absorb my Heaven-Opening Axe.”
 Ancestor Xitian?
 Han Jue frowned even more. He felt that Ancestor Xitian was not such a person.
 “Who stole Pan Xin’s Heaven-Opening Axe?”
 (150 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 (Because your Heaven-Opening Axe has been upgraded to an Ultimate Dao Treasure, his Heaven-Opening Axe has automatically dissipated. Ultimate Dao Treasures are unique, caused by great karma.]
  Han Jue’s expression became strange when he saw this line of words.
 So the thief is me?
 Pan Xin hesitated. “If you’re troubled, then forget it.”
 Han Jue said, “The Heavenly Dao owes the ancestor huge karma. Have you seen it with your own eyes, or has he admitted it?”
 “No, I’m just guessing…”
 Han Jue sighed and took out the Killing Dao Token. He said, “This is the Killing Dao Token, a Slaughter Supreme Treasure. You can kill enemies by sacrificing your lifespan and providence. Your words carry weight. The only flaw is that you can’t kill living beings without invoking karma. I’ll give it to you. I hope you can continue to protect the Heavenly Dao.”
 Han Jue didn’t plan to tell the truth about the Heaven-Opening Axe. There might be future trouble if he didn’t understand.
 The Heaven-Opening Axe was his secret Dharma treasure!


“Thank you, Master! I will definitely protect the Heavenly Dao even if I have to die!” Pan Xin took the Killing Dao Token and said excitedly.
He began to kowtow.
The Freedom Slaughter Supreme Treasure was a Supreme Treasure that was difficult to find even in the Chaos. To him, a Freedom Sage, it was definitely enough!
Han Jue patted his shoulder and said earnestly, “Life is too mysterious. Without the confidence to overturn them, it’s very difficult for the Heavenly Dao to do anything to them. You have to understand this. The current Heavenly Dao looks powerful, but you should know what the Heavenly Dao before the calamity was like.”
Pan Xin nodded heavily. “I understand. I won’t pester Life anymore.”
Han Jue said, “Of course, if anyone dares to harm the Heavenly Dao, kill them if you’re confident!”
“Alright!”
Pan Xin was very excited. He touched the Killing Dao Token lovingly after Han Jue left.
He could sense the power contained in the token. The killing intent was very strong. Perhaps it was not as domineering as the Heaven-Opening Axe, but it was not that far off.
Han Jue returned to the Daoist temple in the Hundred Peak Immortal River and teleported to the second Dao Field. He released the nurtured Killing Intent Fiendcelestial and let Murong Qi receive him.
As the Fiendcelestials became stronger, he was already looking forward to the scene of the Fiendcelestial Army rampaging through the Chaos.
Han Jue hesitated for a moment but still nodded.
It was mainly because Han Jue’s Dao Field was already invincible. He would not be afraid even if the Fiendcelestial Army was exposed!
With a thought, Han Jue pulled the personal disciples of the second Dao Field into the Myriad Worlds Projection. As for the Chaotic Fiendcelestials he created, he didn’t let them in for the time being.
He sent a voice transmission to every personal disciple in the second Dao Field, strictly forbidding them from telling anyone anything about the Fiendcelestial Army. They would be severely punished once they were discovered. After doing all of this, he returned to the main Dao Field to cultivate.
In the Myriad Worlds Projection.
Dao Comprehension Sword, Murong Qi, Li Yao, Great Loose Heaven, Han Ming, Yang Du, Guan Bubai, and the crimson fox appeared.
The crimson fox, Great Loose Heaven, Han Ming, Yang Du, and Guan Bubai were very curious about the Myriad Worlds Projection. Fortunately, Murong Qi introduced it to them.
The Myriad Worlds Projection was not big. It was equivalent to a dark palace, and it only provided them with information.
“The missing people have returned!” the Black Hell Chicken suddenly shouted, startling the other personal disciples in the Myriad Worlds Projection.
Everyone gathered around and asked where they had gone.
Murong Qi and the others only said that it was arranged by Master. It was confidential and could not be disclosed.
Upon hearing that it involved Han Jue, the personal disciples didn’t dare to ask anymore.
Zhao Xuanyuan walked over and said smugly, “Brothers, do you know that the three of us just broke through recently?”
Murong Qi asked curiously, “What realm?”
“Mid-stage Primordial Chaos Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm!”
“So terrifying?” Murong Qi exclaimed, but he wanted to laugh in his mind.
I’m already at the late-stage Primordial Chaos Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm!
He wasn’t the only one. The crimson fox and the Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial had also reached the late-stage Primordial Chaos Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm.
Zhou Fan suddenly appeared and smiled. “You dare to pretend in the mid-stage? I’m already at the perfected realm!”
Jiang Yi snorted. “What are you pretending for? Without the Great Dao Tower, whether you can attain the Dao is another matter.”
Zhou Fan said proudly, “Then, why don’t you have a Great Dao Tower?”
“Hehe.”
“There’s nothing good about the Great Dao Tower. It can only defend, smash people, and help with cultivation.”
More and more personal disciples entered the Myriad Worlds Projection. Things became lively for a time.
Fang Liang also appeared.
The moment he saw Fang Liang, Murong Qi immediately went up. The two of them had an extremely good relationship in the past, and it was the same now. They felt extremely close after not seeing each other for many years.
They couldn’t sense each other’s aura in the Myriad Worlds Projection, so they didn’t know their cultivation.
The brothers walked to the side and chatted.
Guan Bubai said proudly, “You guys should hurry up and cultivate. Don’t be left behind by
us!”
Everyone looked at him.
Murong Qi glared at him and sent a voice transmission, “Do you want to anger Grandmaster? This space was created by him! Your every move is in his eyes!”
Guan Bubai was stunned.
The Black Hell Chicken came over and asked, “Are you cultivating quickly by following Master?”
Guan Bubai muttered, “It’s alright. It’s equivalent to having several Great Dao Towers.”
He did not understand what the Great Dao Tower was, but he couldn’t stand Zhou Fan’s posturing. His words infuriated Zhou Fan, but he was more surprised.
For a time, the personal disciples were stirred by the conversation in the Myriad Worlds Projection.
In the Dark Forbidden Zone, a huge palm quickly moved forward. The palm faced up, and white bones could be seen at the end.
The twelve Ancestral Magi stood on the palm with hundreds of Grand Magi. The Ancestral Magi were Houtu, Di Jiang, Goumang, Zhurong, Rushou, Gonggong, Xuanming, Qiang Liang, Zhu Jiuyin, Tian Wu, Yanzi, and She Bishi. They were formed from Pangu’s blood essence.
Empress Houtu looked at Di Jiang and asked, “Brother, are you sure Father’s will is in the Heavenly Dao?”
Di Jiang said, “That should be right.”
Zhurong smiled. “We can revive Father once we find his will. At that time, our Magus Race will dominate the Chaos. Just thinking about it makes me excited!”
The other Ancestral Magi laughed, their faces filled with anticipation for a beautiful future.
Houtu said worriedly, “The current Heavenly Dao is different from before. Don’t act recklessly when you reach there. Although I have a relationship with Han Jue, that’s not enough for us to act recklessly.”

Di Jiang smiled. “Don’t worry, I know what to do. Besides, the Heavenly Dao was created by Father. We don’t plan to be enemies with the Heavenly Dao.”
Hearing this, the worry on Houtu’s face eased.
At this moment, a powerful aura attacked from ahead and blocked the huge palm.
The twelve Ancestral Magi immediately became vigilant and prepared to fight.
A disdainful laugh sounded as a terrifying huge face appeared in the darkness ahead, smiling sinisterly. Its pupils were hundreds of times larger than a huge palm, as if a giant was staring down at a tiny ant.
Di Jiang shouted in a low voice, “Who do you think you are? Do you want to block the way?”
The disdainful laughter sounded again. “You have been suppressed by the Heavenly Dao in the Ancient Desolate for countless years. Houtu has never been able to escape the cycle of reincarnation and has been suppressed by the Heavenly Dao Sages. Now that she has finally established herself, do you still want to turn around and curry favor with the Heavenly Dao? Don’t you think it’s ridiculous?”
