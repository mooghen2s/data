 “My descendants have their own future. Let them be.”
 Han Jue thought silently. It had been a long time since he interfered with his descendants and disciples.
 Han Jue looked at the Chaos after reading the emails.
 Peace returned to the Chaos after the Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil was suppressed. Although more than half of the living beings were killed, Han Jue discovered that the providence of the Chaos was actually increasing very quickly.
 !!
 Not only that, but the Chaos was expanding! To be precise, it was not expanding. It was more like it was being torn apart. The chaotic space was collapsing layer by layer. The Spirit Qi also spread out and became thin.
 It seemed that the Ninth Chaos was preparing to tear the Chaos apart. Of course, it was not simply tearing it apart, but an increase in creation. It broke through the restrictions of the blank domain on the Great Dao World, causing it to be distributed to every corner of the blank domain, which would usher in the Endless Era.
 The Chaos was already endless to living beings below the Great Dao Sage Realm. The blank domain was even larger. Even the Dao Creators did not know how big it was.
 However, one thing was certain. The current blank domain was led by the Chaos. Other than that, the other Great Dao Worlds were not big and could not threaten the Chaos.
 It was unknown if the arrival of the Endless Era still needed Han Huang’s strength.
 Han Jue looked forward to who the seventh Dao Creator was going to be.
 Chaotic Consciousness, Yin-Yang Purity
 Nirvana Deity, Chaotic Consciousness, Immeasurable Destruction Venerable, Formless Transcendent Deity, Divine Might Heavenly Sage!
 Han Jue decided to wait in anticipation.
 He looked at the Ultimate Origin World next. The Ultimate Origin World was still steadily developing. Humans even appeared.
 Han Jue didn’t care about his name. He saw through Han You’s thoughts and knew he wanted to please him.
 Han Jue might take care of him in the future because of his name.
 Unfortunately, he didn’t have that thought for
 now.
 Han Jue continued cultivating after seeing that everything was fine.
 Two seclusion cycles passed in the blink of an
 This meant that 20 million years had passed.
 The Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity had yet to be successfully enslaved!
 Han Jue had no choice but to continue waiting. The Chaos regained its vitality after so many years. With more living beings, there were also more battles. The Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity was uttered by all living beings again.
 The Nine Extremes Orthodoxy roped in many Dark believers after claiming to believe in the Dark Forbidden Lord. However, many troubles also followed. At least, they had severed the path of unifying the Chaos. All living beings were still very resistant to the Dark Forbidden Lord. They felt that he was not a good person just from his name and style.
 However, Zhao Shuangquan was already obsessed. He swore to gather the power to
 resist the Divine Might Heavenly Sage. As for unifying the Chaos, it was no longer that important to him.
 Han Jue began to ignore the Chaos. He only wanted to break through and enslave the Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity now. Twenty million years of cultivation allowed
 Han Jue to get closer and closer to breaking
 through.
 He wanted to see what would happen first, his break through or the successful enslaving of the Dao Creator.
 Han Jue closed his eyes.
 On the other side.
 The Nine Divine Stars and Shan’e had already
 established their own Daoist temples at the side. After all, they had been chased out for so
 long. It was impossible for them to not have a
 home.
 Han Jue’s seclusion made the disciples guess. Even the Dao Companions were guessing.
 Han Jue’s women would gather in Xing Hongxuan’s Daoist temple every once in a while. Other than discussing the Dao, they would also chat and discuss some Chaotic
 matters.
 Dao Comprehension Sword chuckled. “He rarely looked at us in the past. Get used to it.”
 She and Li Yao often felt like they had been forgotten by Han Jue before the Dao Field was opened.
 Fairy Xi Xuan sighed. “What realm will he reach if he breaks through again?” The women sighed.
 Li Yao, who was the most motivated in
 cultivation, was even more fascinated.
 At this moment, a voice came from outside the
 Daoist temple.
 “Mothers, I’m here to visit. I have something to ask of you.’
 ||
 Han Yunjin was Li Yao’s son.
 All the women doted on him, even surpassing
 the other children, including Xing Hongxuan. Although Han Huang was outstanding, Han Yunjin was the only one who often returned to visit them, unlike their other children who
 would not return after going out and could only meet during the Chaotic Assembly. “Come in,” Xing Hongxuan said. She was the master of the Daoist temple, so she naturally had the right to speak.
 Han Yunjin entered the temple and bowed respectfully to each mother. His posture was very respectful. Even Dao Comprehension Sword beamed.
 Dao Comprehension Sword smiled. “Yue’er
 isn’t here. Otherwise, she would definitely be asking you questions.”
 Perhaps because of their similar personalities, Dao Comprehension Sword and Chang Yue’er were very close.
 Han Yunjin smiled. “She wants to take in some
 women from the Han family as her disciples.
 I’ve already chosen a batch of female disciples for her.”
 Li Yao asked, “Just say it. What is it?”
 Han Yunjin paused for a moment before
 saying, “Recently, I heard that a woman wants to marry Second Brother. This woman’s father is the master of a Chaotic overlord force. In
 order to attract Second Brother, he prepared to attack the Heavenly Dao and wanted to force him to appear…
 Speaking of this, he was speechless.
 He did not expect the Heavenly Dao to suffer
 such an undeserved calamity.
 because of the Sages.
 Xing Hongxuan frowned. “Is this woman so domineering?”
 She naturally paid attention to her daughter-in-law, but this matter made her very unhappy.
 She wasn’t the only one. The others were also
 very unhappy.
 Qingluan’er said, “Perhaps this is the reason why Huang’er doesn’t like her.”
 Xuan Qingjun smiled. “It’s not easy to subdue such a woman. Back then, I had the same attitude towards your father. I didn’t really like
 him then.”
 Han Yunjin smiled bitterly. “Mothers, it’s mainly the Heavenly Dao now. Most of the
 descendants of the Han family are in the Heavenly Dao. The Han family will be affected
 if the Hidden Sect doesn’t make a move or if Second Brother doesn’t return.” Xing Hongxuan snorted. “Sisters, why don’t we
 go? We should do something after cultivating for so long.”
 Xuan Qingjun’s eyes lit up. She was the Demon Lord back then.
 Qingluan’er was a little nervous. She had never
 fought.
 Dao Comprehension Sword looked at Li Yao.
 Li Yao nodded slowly under Han Yunjin’s
 expectant gaze.
 The strongest among the women was Li Yao. She had to take the lead.
 The women grew confident since she agreed.
 After all, they were facing a Chaotic overlord force.
 They were convinced by Li Yao’s strength. They had sparred with each other in the simulation
 trial.
 Han Yunjin smiled. He admired his mother the
 most. As a woman, she had a tenacious will that was not inferior to his father. Han Yunjin left after exchanging some pleasantries.
 The women chatted about the situation in the
 Chaos. They were also very curious about the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity. Xing Hongxuan, Xuan Qingjun, and Li Yao had already begun to establish their Great Dao Worlds, so they were all looking forward to the Endless Era.
 …
 Han Jue was immersed in cultivation.
 A black vortex suddenly appeared in front of
 him before his seclusion ended. He opened his eyes with a strange expression.


 Summoning me?
 Han Jue was a little unhappy. He wanted to break through in one go, but his rhythm was interrupted.
 However, it was Xing Hongxuan who had summoned him. He had to help her.
 He looked at the other end of the black vortex.
 !!
 It was the Heavenly Dao.
 At this moment.
 Countless figures floated in the vast void outside the Heavenly Dao. All sorts of vast Dharma treasures were mixed in. Several Chaotic Cities and Chaotic Heavenly Roads had already been destroyed. The cultivators on the Heavenly Dao’s side had their backs facing the Heavenly Dao. Their number was great, but the aura gathered together was far inferior to the enemy.
 Countless corpses floated in the void between the two sides. Most of them were Heavenly Dao lifeforms.
 Li Yao, Xing Hongxuan, Xuan Qingjun, and the other women stood among the Sages. All the Sages looked at the black vortex in front of Xing Hongxuan.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du’s eyes were also filled with anticipation.
 How many years had it been? He missed the atmosphere when he discussed the Heavenly Dao with Han Jue. At that time, he felt no pressure with Han Jue around.
 “Are you summoning Han Huang? Very good, I’ll wait!”
 A laugh sounded. The speaker was in a pavilion. She stood in front of the guardrail in a gorgeous dress. Her face was beautiful and her posture was arrogant, like an Empress looking down on all living beings.
 She was called Goddess Ming Ji, and she was very famous in the Chaos. She was extremely powerful.
 Below the pavilion was a seven-headed beast as big as a star. It had a body like a huge turtle and seven heads like dragons, tigers, qilins, and so on.
 In front of the seven-headed beast stood three Great Dao Supremes and dozens of Great Dao Sages.
 Just the three Great Dao Supremes were enough to suffocate the Heavenly Dao.
 One of them had even reached the perfected Great Dao Supreme Realm. His aura was even more dazzling than the bright sun.
 Many mighty figures appeared in the Heavenly Dao, but they had already established their own sects, causing no one in the Heavenly Dao to be stronger than Li Yao.
 Li Yao could resist the three Great Dao Supremes, but the Heavenly Dao was at a
 disadvantage in the Great Dao Sage battle.
 “Is that senior summoning the Divine Punisher Han Huang?”
 “It’s said that they are all the Dao Companions of the Divine Might Heavenly Sage. The one using the summoning Mystical Power is Han Huang’s biological mother.”
 “They look so young.’
 “They’re courting death. When Han Huang
 “Why isn’t he out yet?”
 The Heavenly Dao Sages discussed. The
 cultivators behind them also spoke, but their knowledge was shallow. Many of them had never even heard of Han Huang. They only knew that this was a calamity for the Heavenly Dao. After the cruel battle just now, they knew that the Heavenly Dao was about to lose. They would all die if they did not invite the Chaotic
 mighty figures.
 The black vortex was silent. Only space fluctuated and nothing appeared.
 The entire void fell silent for a time.
 Seconds passed.
 The black vortex still did not move.
 Xing Hongxuan frowned. Xuan Qingjun, Li Yao, and the other women were also a little
 flustered.
 Could it be that there was a mistake in the
 Mystical Power and they could not summon their husband?
 Or was he busy cultivating in seclusion and could not be distracted?
 It was troublesome no matter what.
 The waiting Goddess Ming Ji’s expression changed from anticipation to anger.
 She thought of the man who had saved her but
 despised her. Could it be that he had already
 That’s right.
 With his personality, he did not care about
 anyone at all, much less have any burden. If he came today, wouldn’t he be telling the enemy that the Heavenly Dao was his weakness?
 The more she thought about it, the angrier she became. Her beautiful face turned cold as she said, “Do it. Destroy the Heavenly Dao! Hmph!”
 Her subordinates roared. The Great Dao Sage mobilized his Dharmic powers again and prepared to attack.
 However, the three Great Dao Supremes did not move. Their expressions were extremely ugly as they stared at the black vortex in front of Xing Hongxuan.
 The Great Dao Supreme in the middle asked in
 a low voice, “Who are you?”
 The originally restless Chaotic Army fell silent
 again.
 Goddess Ming Ji narrowed his eyes at the black
 vortex and looked happy.
 “Han Huang, I’ll immediately retreat as long as
 you say the word!” Goddess Ming Ji said, causing the gazes of the Heavenly Dao to land
 on the black vortex.
 Xing Hongxuan snorted. “I didn’t summon my son!”
 Goddess Ming Ji was stunned and her expression turned extremely ugly. She felt like she was being played.
 “What a waste of time. Hurry up and flatten the Heavenly Dao!” Goddess Ming Ji shouted hysterically. She sounded crazy and no longer as graceful as before.
 The Chaotic Army was about to take action when a cold snort sounded. Other than the three Great Dao Supremes and Goddess Ming Ji, the entire Chaotic Army was suddenly reduced to ashes.
 Even the seven-headed beast under Goddess
 Ming Ji’s feet was destroyed in body and soul.
 A terrifying killing intent locked onto Goddess
 Ming Ji, scaring her so much that she was unable to move.
 The three Great Dao Supremes were even more
 so affected.
 The Heavenly Dao was dumbfounded upon
 seeing the Chaotic Army being instantly destroyed.
 What happened?
 Who came?
 The Heavenly Dao Sages guessed the truth. All
 of them were excited, but they did not dare to speak, afraid that they would appear rude. Dao Comprehension Sword heaved a sigh of relief and patted her chest. She muttered, “I knew it. It’s impossible for him to ignore us.” Xing Hongxuan smiled proudly. “Little girl, are you going to continue being arrogant?” She was very unhappy with Goddess Ming Ji. This woman wanted to pursue her son, but she dared to kill his mother. She couldn’t have such a daughter-in-law.
 Goddess Ming Ji did not answer. She just stared at the black vortex.
 never invade the Heavenly Dao again!”
 With that, the three Great Dao Supremes immediately turned around and transformed into beams of light, bringing Goddess Ming Ji
 away.
 The black vortex in front of Xing Hongxuan shrank until it disappeared.
 The Heavenly Dao was in an uproar and cheered.
 “We’re saved!”
 “It must have been the Divine Might Heavenly Sage just now!”
 “Is the Divine Might Heavenly Sage really so powerful? I didn’t even see him.” “That’s an existence that surpasses the Chaos.
 How terrifying was that Ultimate Evil Chaotic
 Devil? But wasn’t he easily suppressed?”
 “Why did he let that demoness go?”
 Inside the Daoist temple. Han Jue was calculating the karma between
 Goddess Ming Ji and Han Huang. The reason why he didn’t kill her was that Goddess Ming Ji and Han Huang were actually fated. Marriage was also related to karma. Different
 cultivation levels could see marriage further away.
 Han Huang did not have any feelings for
 Goddess Ming Ji, but he had never had a woman before. He had never even been tempted. Han Jue hoped that Han Huang would have this experience to stabilize his Dao. As for how long Han Huang and Goddess Ming
 “What’s the big deal? Continue cultivating!”
 Han Jue snorted and continued to break through. Year after year passed.
 was already close to it.
 Han Jue had no choice but to take out the Book of Misfortune and curse the Ninth Chaos. He naturally had to cause trouble to the Ninth Chaos if his breakthrough was slow.


 Han Jue’s lifespan began to decrease after cursing for five days.
 Just like before, Han Jue cursed the Ninth Chaos until his cultivation was damaged.
 Cracks appeared in the Chaos again and a large number of evil devils appeared.
 Tens of thousands of years later, such a situation also happened in the Ultimate Origin World. A large number of spatial cracks appeared and some unknown evil devils were born, bringing calamity to all living beings.
 Han Jue did this on purpose as if he was also cursed.
 As for how many living beings would die, he did not care.
 The Ultimate Origin World would eventually face its own calamity. This calamity was equivalent to bringing it forward.
 From Han Jue’s point of view, the life and death of the living beings in the Ultimate
 Origin World didn’t affect him unless the entire
 world was destroyed.
 Then, Han Jue continued cultivating to break through.
 Apart from Han Jue, no one knew that the
 Ninth Chaos was cursed. The Ninth Chaos had
 never looked for other Dao Creators.
 Although the Chaos was lively, the blank domain was strangely silent.
 In a mysterious dark space.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor stood in front of the Formless Transcendent Deity. His head was lowered as he did not dare to look at the other party.
 The Formless Transcendent Deity said, “Are you ready?”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor said, “I’m already prepared. I won’t regret it even if I die.”
 “If you succeed, not only will you attain the Great Dao Supreme Realm, but you will also create your own Great Dao World. This will pave the way for you in the future. Remember, no matter what you see or encounter, even the feelings of your body are fake. Keep your faith firm.”
 “I understand.”
 A pillar of light descended from the sky and landed on his body as soon as the Evil Heavenly Emperor finished speaking. His body was instantly destroyed and his soul knelt in the
 pillar of light, trembling in pain.
 He did not scream or wail, but it was obvious how torturous it was from the looks of his struggling soul.
 A figure appeared beside the Formless Transcendent Deity at this moment. It was a stone statue man. It was burly and strong, as if it was wearing armor. A pair of abnormally huge stone wings could be seen on its back.
 “Father, do you really trust him?” the stone statue asked unhappily.
 The Formless Transcendent Deity replied, “Yes, and I look forward to it.”
 “Why?”
 “Because I watched him grow. Also, he has
 another use.”
 “What use?”
 “You shouldn’t know.”
 “Father, now that the various Great Dao Worlds
 are fighting, we want to be stepping stones for the Chaotic lifeforms. Is that really good? Your favor for the Chaotic geniuses has already far exceeded all living beings!”
 “You can’t even defeat the Nine-Headed Divine Spirit, so how can you shoulder the
 responsibility of all living beings?”
 “I…”
 The stone statue was furious, but it could not
 refute.
 “I have a mission for you. I will reconsider it if
 you succeed.”
 “What mission?”
 “Join the Nine Extremes Orthodoxy and investigate the Dark Forbidden Lord’s true identity.”
 “Alright!”
 The stone statue immediately disappeared.
 The Formless Transcendent Deity looked at the Evil Heavenly Emperor again and waited
 quietly.
 In the Daoist temple of the third Dao Field.
 [You are 300 million years old and your life has
 taken another step forward. You have the following choices:]
 [1: Exit seclusion immediately and devour all
 the other Great Dao Worlds. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment, a Primordial Fragment, a Creation Spirit Stone, and a chance to upgrade the system function.]
 [2: Cultivate in a low-profile manner and maintain your original intention. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment, a Primordial Fragment, a Creation Spirit Stone, and a chance
 to upgrade the system function.]
 [You have obtained a Creation Heaven’s Chosen
 attempt.]
 Han Jue opened his eyes and looked defeated.
 He had failed to break through within the estimated time.
 Damn it, he was only a hundred thousand years
 away!
 He was about to break through!
 Han Jue silently chose the second option.
 [You chose to cultivate in a low-profile manner and obtained a Great Dao Fragment, a Primordial Fragment, a Creation Spirit Stone, and a chance to upgrade the system function.]
 [Please choose the system function you desire
 to upgrade.]
 Han Jue looked at the notification in front of
 him and silently made his choice.
 [The derivation function has begun to upgrade.]
 Han Jue’s expression softened. He hoped that after upgrading, even an
 Ultimate Dao Treasure would not be able to block it!
 Han Jue looked at the Ultimate Origin Soul
 Oblivion ahead. The Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity had yet to be successfully enslaved. It seemed that he had still underestimated the
 long time the system had given him.
 He continued to cultivate.
 A thousand years later.
 The derivation function was successfully upgraded.
 [The derivation function has been successfully
 upgraded. It can ignore the Ultimate Dao
 Treasure’s karma protection.]
 Awesome!
 Han Jue smiled.
 Should he try it? Forget it, I’ll break through first!
 Nothing was more important than his cultivation. Information was minimal as long as he was strong enough.
 Han Jue focused on cultivating.
 Fifty thousand years later.
 Han Jue began to break through.
 He successfully broke through a little more
 than three thousand years later! Perfected Dao Creator!
 Han Jue felt a long-awaited transformation. He was not the only one. The entire Ultimate Origin World began to transform. The Ultimate
 Origin Qi soared. The Ultimate Origin Lifeforms who had just eliminated the evil devils thought that it was a reward from the heavens. This

 His lifespan increased again!
 Should he curse the Ninth Chaos before breaking through?
 Forget it.
 Actually, he had always yearned to fight the
 Ninth Chaos.
 This was also the reason why he would not go overboard every time he cursed the Ninth Chaos. He wanted to delay the other party’s cultivation progress, but he did not want his cultivation level to fall too much.
 Only the Ninth Chaos could be an opponent on the path of invincibility. Han Jue treated him as the ultimate boss.
 Creator.
 Even if it was a minor realm, the higher one
 went, the greater the difference! Han Jue started the simulation trial.
 He challenged the Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana
 Deity!
 After all, this fellow was at the mid-stage Dao
 Creator Realm. He was stronger than the Formless Transcendent Deity and the
 Immeasurable Destruction Venerable.
 A hundred thousand Yin-Yang Void Nirvana Deities!
 Instant kill!
 Dao Creators were not undying in the
 Han Jue directly raised it to a million Yin-Yang
 Void Nirvana Deities in one go! He finally felt a little pressure. It took him a
 third of a second to kill them all! Two million Yin-Yang Void Nirvana Deities!
 This time, the pressure was great! All the Great Dao Worlds would probably be
 instantly destroyed when that vast power gathered together, including the Transcendent Rule, destroying the past, present, and future! Awesome! Han Jue finally felt his blood boiling!


 Han Jue’s mood returned to normal after playing the simulation trial for a few days.
 He didn’t leave the Daoist temple. Instead, he continued to wait for the Ultimate Origin Heavenly Prison to end enslaving the target.
 He looked outside the Daoist temple. The Nine Divine Stars and Shan’e were gathered together to cultivate. Their cultivation levels were at least at the mid-stage Great Dao Supreme Realm.
 Han Jue wondered if he should tell them to go train outside.
 It could be seen that these guys also yearned for the Chaos.
 Han Jue created a clone and went to teach the Nine Divine Stars and Shan’e.
 Time passed.
 Millions of years later.
 The Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity was finally enslaved.
 [Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity has a favorable impression of you. Current favorability: Max.] The Ultimate Origin Soul dissipated and the Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity condensed his main body. He knelt in front of him respectfully.
 Han Jue asked some questions and instructed some things before sending the Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity back to the blank domain.
 The Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity appeared in the blank domain. Just as he was about to fly back to his Great Dao World, the Immeasurable Destruction Venerable sent a voice
 transmission to him.
 The two Dao Creators appeared in a mysterious space.
 “What happened earlier?” the Immeasurable Destruction Venerable asked.
 “After I lost, I went to the Divine Might Heavenly Sage’s Dao Field to listen to the Dao. The Dao discussion during this period of time has benefited me greatly. I’m preparing to enter seclusion.”
 “Just listening to the Dao?”
 “Yes, the Divine Might Heavenly Sage is an ascetic. He warned me that if I find trouble with him again, he won’t be so easy to talk to next time. I also promised not to scheme against the Ultimate Origin World.”
 The Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity’s answer made the Immeasurable Destruction Venerable
 less confused.
 That’s right.
 The battle between Han Jue and the Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity was not a spar. They were clearly angry. If that was the case, how could they discuss the Dao after the battle?
 The Immeasurable Destruction Venerable gloated upon hearing that the Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity had been warned by Han Jue.
 He had always been unhappy with the Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity. He had been bullied by this fellow before.
 The Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity snorted. “Is
 there anything else? If you want to see a joke, I can let you experience my previous feelings.”
 Nothing had changed!
 He was still so domineering and arrogant.
 The two Dao Creators chatted for a while before
 leaving.
 The Immeasurable Destruction Venerable came
 to another mysterious space. The Chaotic Consciousness and the Formless Transcendent
 Deity were waiting here.
 “How’s the situation?” the Chaotic
 Consciousness asked.
 “He’s fine. He was warned by the Divine Might
 Heavenly Sage.
 “The Divine Might Heavenly Sage can enslave the enemy. Has he been…”
 “Impossible. We are Dao Creators. Even the
 Chaos can only suppress us. How can we be enslaved? I see that his temperament and
 words haven’t changed.”
 “True.”
 It sounded impossible to enslave a Dao Creator
 and make him loyal to him.
 Unless the Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity was
 convinced, it was impossible for him to serve Han Jue willingly, especially after his defeat.
 The Formless Transcendent Deity said, should wait and see.”
 “We
 The Chaotic Consciousness and the Immeasurable Destruction Venerable nodded.
 Clearly, the Divine Might Heavenly Sage and
 the Ninth Chaos would definitely fight in the
 future.
 The Divine Might Heavenly Sage’s performance
 shocked the three Dao Creators when he battled the Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity.
 This child could already resist the Ninth Chaos!
 agreement.
 They couldn’t answer.
 At least, they thought that Han Jue definitely
 No matter what, they realized that Han Jue was
 no longer someone they could scheme against.
 They could already see an unprecedented battle
 What they could do now was to protect themselves and all the living beings in the Great Dao World.
 310 million years old!
 Han Jue called the Nine Divine Stars and Shan’e
 into the Daoist temple.
 The ten descendants were very excited. How
 many years had it been? They had finally returned.
 They looked at Han Jue carefully. After so many
 The ancestor had been in seclusion for so long.
 It was impossible for him to not have gained anything!
 “Nine Divine Stars, I’ll send you on a mission.
 Go to the Chaos and capture the Ultimate Origin Fiendcelestial,” Han Jue said.
 The Ultimate Origin Fiendcelestial was the Ultimate Origin Cultivation Potential nurtured by Han Ling. Now in the Heavenly Court, this
 fellow used the name of the Ultimate Origin Fiendcelestial and insulted Han Jue.
 It was a good opportunity to train the Nine
 Divine Stars.
 Han Zongdao asked, “Are you going to reveal our identities?”
 Han Jue said, “You can use the name of Nine
 Divine Stars, but you can’t mention me or the
 Hidden Sect.”
 “Understood!”
 The Nine Divine Stars were all excited and rubbed their palms together.
 so many years.
 Shan’e looked at Han Jue in anticipation after
 the Nine Divine Stars left. Han Jue said, “Continue cultivating. The Dao of Curses is different from the Nine Divine Stars.
 You have to hide in the dark in the future and stay by my side.”
 Shan’e felt bitter, but he did not dare to refute. Han Jue smiled. “I’ll bring you out for a walk
 when I’m free in the future.” Shan’e hurriedly thanked him.
 Han Jue started to check his emails. Transcendent existences appeared less frequently, but the battles in the Chaos increased. Han Jue noticed an email. [Your good friend Dao Ancestor obtained the
 help of your good friend Pangu to create a
 Creation Race. His providence has increased greatly.]
 Creation Race?
 Han Jue was secretly curious. He deduced.
 He discovered that Pangu and Hong Jun had
 joined forces to create a Human Race. It looked identical to the Human Race, but its physique far exceeded that of the Heavenly Dao Human
 Race.
 This new race was called the Dao Heavenly
 Race.
 The Dao Heavenly Race was not in the Heavenly Dao but in a corner of the Chaos.
 They didn’t reveal themselves for the time being.
 Han Jue was only interested and had no intention of interfering. Pangu and the Dao Ancestor were already not
 on the same level as him. In addition, the two
 sides were not enemies, so he naturally would not suppress them.
 No one’s cultivation speed could catch up to
 his. Han Jue naturally wouldn’t suppress the juniors.
 It was meaningless to be too invincible. It was also interesting for juniors to overestimate themselves and challenge him occasionally.
 It was not embarrassing to posture.
 At the same time.
 Transcendent Domain, Creation Emperor
 Court.
 Han Huang had just fused with a power that
 transcended the Supreme Rules when his cultivation level increased greatly. The Formless Transcendent Deity had only
 given
 him the power divided by the Supreme Rules, not the Supreme Rules themselves. Otherwise, the Transcendent Domain would
 have collapsed.
 Han Huang
 opened his eyes as killing intent
 flashed across them.
 His mentality also changed as he became
 stronger.
 He had looked down on the other races ever
 since he was born, but he wouldn’t take the initiative to bully them. However, now, he
 suddenly felt a little lonely.


“Looks like my heart is not strong enough. I have great cultivation but no Dao heart,” Han Huang muttered to himself. He would think of his father every time he was puzzled.
He wanted to do the same, so he had not gone out to do anything all these years. However, as time passed, he could not help but feel hostility.
Han Huang felt that something would happen to him if this continued.
Once he lost control, it would not be good for him or all living beings.
He felt lonely and developed killing intent. Now, he also felt that he was terrifying.
However, the thought of destroying all living beings in the Chaos appeared in his heart. It was very difficult for him to extinguish it.
Han Huang stood up and moved to the Heavenly Court.
Heavenly Court, Imperial Garden.
Han Huang and the Evil Heavenly Emperor drank immortal wine.
Han Huang expressed his distress.
The Evil Heavenly Emperor frowned upon hearing that Han Huang actually had such hostility.
The Evil Heavenly Emperor said in a low voice, “Looks like the Primordial Fiendcelestial is more terrifying than I imagined. No wonder there was Chaos after the Primordial Destruction. Huang’er, you can be the Primordial Fiendcelestial, but your father can’t be a Chaotic Fiendcelestial. If he can suppress his hostility, why can’t you?”
Han Huang smiled bitterly. “There can only be one Primordial Fiendcelestial in the Chaos. Father gave me his bloodline before I was born.”
“I see. No wonder you were nurtured for so long.”
“I’m afraid of letting Father down, so I don’t dare to act according to my personality,” Han Huang said worriedly, not losing his usual arrogance.
The Evil Heavenly Emperor narrowed his eyes. “Is it possible that the situation you’re encountering now is not from your bloodline, but the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity? The Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity needs the Primordial Fiendcelestial. In my opinion, it’s definitely not as simple as the rumors. It must be some connection between the Primordial Fiendcelestial and the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity.”
Han Huang was moved.
That wouldn’t be his problem if that was the
case.
The Evil Heavenly Emperor said earnestly, “Huang’er, you should find your father. I don’t know why you don’t like to trouble your father. You’re not the only one. Tuo’er is the same. From my point of view, your father won’t mind helping you.”
The Evil Heavenly Emperor thought of his sons and gritted his teeth. They were either unfilial
or wanted to overthrow him.
Especially Long Hao. Fortunately, he had entrusted Long Hao to Han Jue back then.
Long Hao’s respect for Han Jue far exceeded his. This kid was probably willing to let Long
Hao die.
Han Huang was silent.
The Evil Heavenly Emperor raised his wine cup
and did not disturb his thoughts.
“But Father is very afraid of trouble. He’s
usually busy in seclusion…” Han Huang
frowned.
The Evil Heavenly Emperor smiled. “That was in the past. He was not strong enough, so that was naturally the case. Now, who do you think is your father’s match?”
Han Huang was enlightened.
That’s right.
That was in the past!
Han Huang had been wandering the Chaos for
so long, but he couldn’t think of anyone who could match his father.
Even the Transcendent Lord had said that he
was not his father’s match.
As for the Ninth Chaos, Han Huang had never
heard of it.
The Ninth Chaos was an unknown existence to
him and the Evil Heavenly Emperor. They had never even heard of a legend.
Han Huang immediately stood up and left after figuring it out.
The Evil Heavenly Emperor shook his head and laughed. “This brat is really anxious. He still has to look for his brother to drink.
“Speaking of which, when should I go and
drink with his father?”
…
Ten million years later.
Han Jue opened his eyes and felt Han Huang
waiting outside. He had been waiting for millions of years.
He called Han Huang in as he started to check
his emails.
[Your descendant Han Zongdao was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure.]
[Your descendant Han Fan was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure.]
[Your descendant Long Minggu was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure.]
[Your daughter Han Ling received a dream.
from a transcendent existence. Her cultivation has increased.]
[Your disciple Dao Sovereign was attacked by a
Purity Cultivator] x40982182 [Your disciple…]
[Your good friend Huang Zuntian created a
Primordial Mystical Power. His cultivation has increased greatly.]
[Your son Han Tuo has entered the River of
Destiny.]
…
The emails were really lively. Han Jue read
them with relish.
Han Huang came in front of him and bowed
respectfully. “Father, I’m here to find you. I need your help.”
“Tell me.”
“I’ve been feeling hostility recently. I keep thinking…”
Han Huang talked about his situation, attracting Han Jue’s attention. Speaking of which, although they were both
Primordial Fiendcelestials, Han Jue was a Postnatal Primordial Fiendcelestial that had evolved. Han Huang was different. He was born
as a Primordial Fiendcelestial. In a sense, Han Jue had different thoughts from him.
Even if an Azure Dragon was raised by mortals, it was impossible for it to treat everyone as its own. This was the difference in the bloodline.
Han Jue had no choice but to use the derivation function.
“Why does Han Huang want to destroy all living beings in the Chaos?”
[500 trillion years of lifespan will be deducted.
Do you want to continue?]
Continue!
[The Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity’s
karmic influence involves the Blank Domain’s
Transcendent Rule.]
There were Transcendent Rules in the blank domain?
But this made sense!
The birth of everything had a source, after all. The Chaos was born in the Primordial Chaos, and the Primordial Chaos was born in the blank
space. Han Jue didn’t know how the blank space existed for the time being. From the looks of it, the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity needed Han Huang to go berserk and cause all living beings to fight him. They would fight until the Chaos shattered and the Endless Era arrived. It was impossible for Han Huang to directly shatter the Chaos.
In that case, there was no choice. Han Jue said meaningfully, “Since you can’t control it, do as you wish.”
Han Huang was stunned, thinking that he had
heard wrongly.
Han Jue said, “Who doesn’t have negative karma on the path of cultivation? The rules need order, and order will definitely be tainted by the Slaughter Calamity. Perhaps you have let down all the living beings in the Chaos, but you will be the number one contributor to all the beings in the future of the Endless Era. A new race will definitely appear in the Endless Era. A new world that executes destruction and slaughter is also part of the natural order. “All living beings can accept death by the rules.
living
All living beings just can’t accept being killed by other living beings. However, you will
transcend living beings after crossing this hurdle.”
Han Huang frowned as the killing intent in his eyes began to burst out.
He naturally wouldn’t restrain his killing intent with Han Jue’s support.
In fact, the reason why he didn’t want to attack
all living beings was that he was afraid his father would be disappointed. Now that he actually supported him, what couldn’t he figure
out?
“This is the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity.
Fight with all living beings and destroy the
Han Jue smiled. Although he said it heartlessly, it was the truth.
Han Huang asked, “Then, what will happen to
me when the Endless Era arrives? I really don’t have to pay the price?”
He was not stupid. He had heard many legends of the Heavenly Dao’s Immeasurable Calamity.
Although the Devil Ancestor, the Ancestral
Magus, the Demon Emperor, the Devil Emperor, and so on pushed for the calamity, all
of them did not end up well. The ones who
benefited were only those existences who secretly controlled everything. Han Jue said, “Yes, someone will definitely kill
you in the name of righteousness to obtain a
huge opportunity.”
