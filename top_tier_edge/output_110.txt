 Ten thousand years passed.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and looked at Chu Xiaoqi.
 Ever since he helped Chu Xiaoqi, he did not dare to enter seclusion for too long, afraid that if he was not careful, Chu Xiaoqi would be gone.
 Chu Xiaoqi and Chen Jue had already made a name for themselves in the Dao Mystic Realm in the past ten thousand years. They were legendary figures that the Divine Clan of the Immortal World had to look up to.
 In Han Jue’s eyes, ten thousand years was like a day. It was very short, but in the eyes of cultivators, ten thousand years was an era.
 From the looks of it, Chu Xiaoqi and Chen Jue had already established themselves. Unless they encountered existences that far exceeded their cultivation realm, it was very difficult for them to die. Behind Chu Xiaoqi was Huang Zuntian, and behind Chen Jue were Han Yunjin and Han Ling.
 Han Jue smiled and felt that he was too childish.
 He looked at Han Liang. This kid was
 Seeming to sense his gaze, Han Liang opened his eyes. He immediately rubbed his hands and chuckled upon seeing him smiling. “Grandpa, you’re finally awake. When are you letting me out? I’m already a Sage. I’m strong enough!”
 Han Jue smiled. “It’s not enough. Your birth destined that your opponent will be stronger than the opponents others encounter, understand?”
 Han Liang curled his lips. “I know that our Hidden Sect and the Han family are very powerful, but Uncle-Master Long Hao said that no one dares to provoke us!”
 “Don’t listen to him. He almost died outside.”
 Han Jue snorted and recounted Long Hao’s experience in the Heavenly Dao Immeasurable Calamity. Han Liang was shocked again.
 He did not expect the seemingly gentle Long Hao to be so rebellious.
 Han Jue said meaningfully, “This is a path of failure. You have to take it as a warning. I used to think highly of him. Now, I think highly of you the most. Han Liang, you were born extraordinary and are doted on by all. Your starting point is higher than all living beings. Your heart has to calm down. Cultivation is not only cultivation but also heart tempering.”
 Han Liang seemed to understand.
 He had too little experience. Some things sounded clear, but it was very difficult to understand.
 “Then, when can I go out?” Han Liang asked.
 “Great Dao Sage…
 Han Liang’s face turned bitter. Great Dao
 Sage…
 It looked like he was only separated by the Freedom Realm, but it was actually extremely far. After attaining the Dao, he felt that it was very difficult to break through a minor realm. Han Jue ignored this kid and started to check
 his emails.
 He could observe the entire blank domain, he was used to reading emails. This was one
 but
 of his few joys.
 Han Liang struggled for a while before
 continuing to cultivate.
 …
 The mysterious domain was dark and one
 could not even see their fingers.
 A head that emitted a faint light was
 advancing. It was the Chaotic Consciousness. The eight eyes on his face looked in different directions.
 After an unknown period of time, the Chaotic Consciousness finally stopped.
 A crimson egg was in front of him. Its surface
 was wrapped in countless blood vessels. It
 was ghastly and terrifying.
 A dragon-like figure swam inside the huge egg. Occasionally, it would change its figure and emit an ancient aura.
 “You’re finally here…”
 An ancient voice sounded.
 The Chaotic Consciousness asked, “What do you plan to do?”
 The Chaotic Consciousness was silent.
 expected this day, so I severed the mental
 “If this existence perishes with all living beings in the blank domain, we can reconstruct everything.”
 An ancient voice sounded with an indifferent
 tone. The Chaotic Consciousness asked, “Do we really have a chance of winning?” “Are you willing to stop here? You don’t want
 to surpass the Dao Creator Realm anymore?” The Chaotic Consciousness fell silent again. He couldn’t refute the ancient voice.
 All Dao Creators had ambitions stronger than all living beings. The Chaotic Consciousness’ ambition was greater than the other three Dao
 Now that the Formless Transcendent Deity
 and the Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity had
 already submitted to Han Jue, the remaining Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction Venerable was useless.
 The Chaotic Consciousness asked, “How long will that take?”
 “Just wait. It won’t take longer than you
 looks bright, but it’s actually the prelude to destruction. Although he surpasses the Dao Creator Realm, he doesn’t understand the
 blank domain or how the Primordial Chaos destroyed it. As for me, I created the Chaos.”
 The figure in the huge egg suddenly stopped and disappeared. The light of the huge egg converged until it was hidden in the darkness.
 “Next, you have to nurture as many talented people as possible and strengthen your force. The stronger, the better.”
 The Chaotic Consciousness left.
 …
 Ultimate Origin World.
 The Ultimate Origin World had stopped expanding ever since the Endless Era’s
 creation. After fusing with the Purity Great
 Dao World, it was definitely the largest world in the blank domain.
 The Ultimate Origin World was extremely far
 from the center of the Endless Era. Very few living beings were involved in the Ultimate
 Origin World, but its legend had already spread in the center of the Endless Era. The Ultimate Origin World’s interior could be
 said to be extremely exciting. As the era changed, many experts appeared. Han Ling had discovered the Ultimate Origin
 World from the netherworld a long time ago and even nurtured the Ultimate Origin Cultivation Potential, which was Han Zhiyuan of the Ten Divine Stars.
 After that, Han Ling and Han Yunjin joined forces and sent many disciples of the Creation Emperor Court and Han descendants into the
 Ultimate Origin World to develop. They discovered that the Spirit Qi in the Ultimate Origin World far exceeded the various worlds and had eight Supreme Rules. This was definitely the most impressive world. They naturally thought of Han Jue.
 This was also the reason why they dared to be at ease.
 Han Jue didn’t reveal the Ultimate Origin World, and they didn’t ask further. They had a
 tacit understanding.
 At that moment, a demon was born in the Ultimate Origin World. It wreaked havoc in billions of worlds and looked like it was about
 to stir up a calamity. Inside a palace. More than a thousand figures gathered here.
 They were the Great Dao Fiendcelestials born
 in the Ultimate Origin World. Their cultivation levels had at least reached the Great Dao Sage Realm. There were more than
 thirty Great Dao Supremes among them. Such a foundation was very powerful.
 Ultimate Origin World and was called the master of the gods.
 The Life Fiendcelestial scanned the area and asked, “This demon has unprecedented
 power. What do you think?”
 The Great Dao Fiendcelestials were all silent.
 No one spoke.
 That demon was indeed powerful. Many Great Dao Fiendcelestials had already returned in failure. Unless several Great Dao Supremes joined forces, they could not defeat it. After
 and embarrassed.


 Threshold
 The silent hall was extremely oppressive. The Life Fiendcelestial frowned, his eyes filled with displeasure.
 “This demon’s power is indeed extraordinary. Why don’t you ask the heavens?” a Great Dao Fiendcelestial asked.
 The other Great Dao Fiendcelestials agreed as if they had opened a conversation box. The hall instantly entered a noisy state.
 “Yes, since we don’t know, we’ll ask the heavens.”
 “The Divine Lord of the Nether Race seems to be able to contact the heavens.”
 “The Nether Race is just trash. This demon grew up under their noses.”
 “Don’t say that. The Great Dao Fiendcelestial and the Nether Race are both favored children of the heavens. They should be as close as brothers.”
 The Life Fiendcelestial’s brows did not relax at their words.
 He felt that this was nonsense.
 If he could, he would have found it long ago!
 At this moment, an old man said, “I have a way to send this demon into the cycle of reincarnation and use it to slow his growth speed and will.”
 Most of the Great Dao Fiendcelestials agreed with the old man’s proposal.
 The Life Fiendcelestial felt that it made sense and agreed.
 The Great Dao Fiendcelestials heaved a sigh of relief. At least they had a way. They really did not want to face that demon anymore.
 The calamity in the Ultimate Origin World didn’t attract Han Jue’s attention. His Transcendent Rule was an alarm. If there was really a danger that endangered the Ultimate Origin World, the Transcendent Rule would remind him.
 Some factions with blood feuds began to friction, and conflict erupted.
 The battle of the great world began.
 A million years passed in the blink of an eye.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and looked at Chu Xiaoqi first.
 As the battle of the great world began, the Dao Mystic Realm also fell into a storm. The small worlds came from different factions. Although they were gathered together, the control of the old factions was still very
 strong.
 Chu Xiaoqi and Chen Jue had experienced countless life-and-death situations. Although they kept growing, they still could not achieve much in the Dao Mystic Realm. It was mainly because they did not have any forces.
 Han Jue retracted his gaze and looked at Han Liang.
 This kid sat in front of him. His body was
 golden like a golden statue.
 It seemed that Han Liang had already begun
 to study his body.
 His bloodline potential was not inferior to the
 Primordial Fiendcelestial. It was the first brand-new peak bloodline in the Endless Era. Han Jue was still looking forward to it.
 Han Jue said, “Come in.”
 Han Liang opened his eyes and turned
 around. He saw Han Ling walking into the temple and removing her divine light to reveal her true appearance.
 Han Liang chuckled, “Fourth Aunt, long time
 no see!”
 Han Ling smiled at him and walked in front of Han Jue, bowing respectfully.
 Han Jue sighed in his heart. After going out to
 train, the father and daughter were no longer as close as before. They were more like master and disciple.
 It was not only Han Ling. All the children and
 descendants who went out were the same.
 Therefore, once Han Jue wanted to nurture
 someone, he would not let him leave easily. Once he left, it would be very difficult for
 their relationship to recover.
 After his children went out to train and knew
 how tall and strong Han Jue was, they naturally felt reverence for him, let alone
 after not seeing him for a long time.
 Han Jue had five children and countless descendants. Family ties might not be important to him. At least, his children
 thought so.
 “Father, I’m here for the Ultimate Origin
 World,” Han Ling said, making Han Liang find it strange.
 What was the Ultimate Origin World?
 Han Jue didn’t say anything, and Han Ling continued.
 The geniuses sent by the Creation Emperor Court to the Ultimate Origin World had all transformed into Ultimate Origin Lifeforms. Now, in the Ultimate Origin World, all living beings were in a panic, as if the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity of the Chaos had arrived.
 “That evil devil’s power is really strange. He
 twenty Great Dao Supremes join forces.” Han Ling frowned.
 Great Dao Supreme?
 Han Liang was even more curious as if ants were crawling in his heart.
 personally? That’s not your style.” Han Ling said helplessly, “I really can’t hide
 it from you, Father. That power made me fantasize. There are no new Dao Creators in the current Endless Era. I used to think that the rules of the Great Dao World were not
 good, but after seeing that evil devil, I had another opinion.
 “Does the Dao Creator Realm also have to look
 at potential?”
 Han Jue smiled and didn’t reply.
 Han Ling heaved a sigh of relief. It seemed
 that her guess was right!
 She began to feel excited.
 At least she had grasped the true secret of
 Potential!
 Apart from the Great Dao World itself, it was also related to potential. Otherwise, how could there be so few Dao Creators since ancient
 times?
 Han Jue maintained a smile as he stared at Han Ling.
 The evil devil of the Endless Era indeed had
 it attracted the covetous eyes of others. After the conflict erupted, they kept fighting, causing it to lose itself in strength and finally
 Actually, that fellow was not an evil devil. He was the strongest potential born in the Ultimate Origin World. His future achievements were that of a Dao Creator. Therefore, the Great Dao Supremes could not
 see through his future because they could not. They thought that he was a calamity.
 However, it was probably not that simple for Han Ling to target him.
 Han Jue asked, “What do you want to do?”
 Han Ling said, “I’m just curious. How far is
 Han Liang was even more confused. What was this?
 Han Jue said, “All you need is time.” Han Huang, Han Ling, and Han Liang all had
 had Great Creations. On the other hand, the other children were much inferior.
 Han Ling asked, “What do you think of that evil devil?”
 ||
 Han Jue said, “I don’t care.’ Han Ling nodded. The father and daughter
 exchanged a few more pleasantries before Han Ling bid farewell.
 Han Jue sighed faintly after she left. “The human heart is unfathomable, and the Sage Heart is even more unfathomable.’
 Han Liang scratched his head and asked, “What do you mean?”
 “Nothing. Will you change in the future?”
 “Silly kid.”
 “Hehe.”
 Han Liang thought that his grandfather was
 praising him and smiled even more foolishly. Han Jue shook his head.
 He had already seen through Han Ling’s
 ambitions. Ever since the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity ended, Han Ling felt that her Emperor Soldiers were not strong
 enough. She had a bold thought and even succeeded.


 Han Jue didn’t blame Han Ling for her thoughts.
 The path of cultivation was a selfish path. The strong preyed on the weak. There was nothing to say.
 Moreover, that evil devil was not so easy to deal with.
 Han Ling and the evil devil could be each other’s whetstones.
 All these years, Han Huang had walked around in the blank domain. In Han Jue’s emails, Han Huang discovered many new maps. He shed the ruthlessness of the Primordial Fiendcelestial and became more like an expert who had attained the Dao, making Han Jue satisfied.
 Han Jue looked at the clone sent to explore the Origin Space-time. Ever since something happened to Ji Xianshen, he had asked one of his clones to find him. Finding Ji Xianshen was not the most important thing. It was mainly to explore the Origin Space-time.
 The Origin Space-time was indeed impressive. Based on the rules of the blank domain, generally speaking, space-time could be tampered with or even destroyed by cultivators. However, the Origin Space-time could not. It was an independent existence.
 The Origin Space-time determined the development of the rules of the blank domain, not the past and future of living beings.
 Han Jue’s Ultimate Origin World had already condensed nine Supreme Rules. Only a Dao Creator could see the ninth Supreme Rule. Now, he planned to use the Origin Space-time to create the tenth Supreme Rule.
 The more rules there were, the stronger the Ultimate Origin World became.
 There were far fewer than three thousand
 Great Dao back when the Ninth Chaos created
 In the future, Han Jue would have more
 Supreme Rules. It was not impossible to reach three thousand.
 Chu Xiaoqi and Chen Jue had already
 stabilized themselves. Han Jue planned to
 return to his previous seclusion state.
 He was still the person who kept wanting to
 Han Jue slowly closed his eyes.
 Ten million years had passed when he opened
 his eyes again.
 He was already 580 million years old!
 Ten million years was also a long time for the
 Endless Era.
 Sage and was not at the early stage. Because Han Jue didn’t open his eyes, he shouldn’t disturb him rashly.
 He had been waiting for this moment!
 Not long after Han Jue opened his eyes, he immediately woke up from his cultivation. Han Jue said before he could speak, “You can go out.”
 “Yay!”
 Han Liang jumped up excitedly like a child.
 He flattered him for a while before leaving the
 Daoist temple in a hurry.
 Han Jue smiled and looked at the Ninth Chaos’ will. He didn’t know when he could
 successfully enslave it.
 He started checking his emails.

 rules of the blank domain. His cultivation has increased.]
 [Your good friend Evil Heavenly Emperor fell into a blank crack and into the Anti-Magic Domain.]
 His circle of friends had been very lively in
 the past ten million years. More battles also ensued.
 Some of Han Jue’s disciples and children also
 began to fight with each other. He was not angry about this. Instead, he watched with
 relish.
 What he cared about in the past was not so
 much now, because he had the ability to protect and reconstruct everything. He would find it boring if the world in his eyes remained the same.
 He had no reason to stop the juniors from
 fighting. The higher one’s cultivation realm
 Han Jue suddenly had an idea.
 He immediately came to the Formless Transcendent Deity’s palace.
 The Formless Transcendent Deity had created
 a separate world above the center of the blank
 domain, symbolizing his status. The Formless Transcendent Deity seemed to sense something and opened his eyes. Seeing that it was Han Jue, he immediately bowed respectfully and lowered his posture.
 He knew that everything he had now was given to him by Han Jue.
 Han Jue didn’t imprison him in the Ultimate
 Origin Heavenly Prison because he was
 Origin World. You can gather the Great Dao Supremes and give them a chance. I’ve already thrown this Divine Authority into the
 lower realm. As for where it is, let them find it,” Han Jue said. The Formless Transcendent Deity couldn’t help but look up.
 was useless to him, but Han Jue was the Creator Lord.
 After an unknown period of time, the Formless Transcendent Deity woke up. Han Jue was no longer in the hall.
 He sighed. “As expected of a Creator Lord.”
 He immediately summoned all the Great Dao Supremes and Dao Creators of the Endless
 Era.
 A hundred years later, all the Great Dao Supremes gathered in the hall. The Chaotic Consciousness, the Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity, and Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction Venerable also came. The Great Dao Supremes of the Ultimate
 Origin World were also present. The current Ultimate Origin World was no longer isolated from the world.
 where it is, I don’t know.” The hall exploded. Even the Chaotic Consciousness, Shi Tian’s
 Immeasurable Destruction Venerable, and the Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity were quite shocked. They didn’t expect Han Jue to take
 out the power of a Supreme Rule to reward all
 living beings.
 Han Huang, Han Tuo, Han Ling, Han Qing’er,
 Pangu, Hong Jun, the twelve Ancestral Magi, Ancestor Xitian, and the other ancient existences of the Heavenly Dao were also
 waiting expectantly.
 Mighty figures agreed with him, but even more mighty figures had already begun to think about where the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority would be.


 The door to the Transcendent Divine Hall opened and mighty figures flew out. Nearly half of the mighty figures quickly used their Mystical Powers and fled out of the sea of clouds. The remaining mighty figures began to interact.
 Han Tuo, Han Huang, Han Ling, Han Qing’er, Han Ye, Han Yao, Han Bashen, Yi Tian, and the others gathered and left together.
 Yi Tian smiled. “Why don’t the Creator Lord directly reward you with this Great Dao Providence Divine Authority?”
 Han Tuo shook his head. “Father is already the Lord. All living beings are his children. What’s the point of bias?”
 The others nodded.
 They had their own living beings ever since they established their Great Dao World. Their mentality was also changing, so they could understand Han Jue’s thoughts.
 If he really favored them by blood and had many children, who should he favor?
 They began to discuss where Han Jue would throw the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority.
 Long Hao suddenly mentioned, “Could it be in the Heavenly Dao?”
 The others’ eyes lit up.
 It was impossible for this Great Dao
 Providence Divine Authority to be in the
 Ultimate Origin World. Other than the
 Ultimate Origin World, only the Heavenly Dao
 had a high possibility!
 They immediately took action.
 In the third Dao Field.
 Han Jue and Xing Hongxuan were chatting in
 the Daoist temple.
 “Tang Wan? That girl hasn’t mentioned
 Xiaoqi for a long time.”
 Xing Hongxuan shook her head in pity.
 Han Jue smiled. “Perhaps she’s hiding it in her heart. You can let her go.”
 Xing Hongxuan spread her hands and said, “My clone has long given her freedom, but she doesn’t want to leave. She still wants to cultivate with my clone.”
 Tang Wan was not a Hidden Sect disciple, so she naturally could not enter the Dao Field. Therefore, Xing Hongxuan asked her clone to teach Tang Wan. This lasted for ten million years.
 “Then let her go to the Dao Mystic Realm.”
 “Alright, I quite like this girl. I’ll send my clone to help her if she encounters danger. Is that okay?”
 “Up to you. When have I ever restricted you?”
 “I thought you would set some rules.”
 “There’s no need.”
 Han Jue smiled. He indeed didn’t ask for
 anything from the Endless Era. The one who set the rules was the Formless Transcendent Deity. He was happy to do this.
 The Great Deity who had once claimed to transcend everything and not be affected by karma was now a rule maker and controlled all living beings. The difference was really
 great.
 The two of them talked about Han Huang next. Xing Hongxuan sighed. “This kid seems to have changed recently. He traveled the heavens and accumulated a lot of merit. He seems to be clearing his reputation.”
 change between good and bad. It’s just defined by their level and standpoint. Huang’er only let go of his arrogance. In the
 past, he treated all living beings as ants. Now,
 he truly realizes that the difference in bloodline only affects cultivation. To the essence of living beings, there’s no difference.”
 Xing Hongxuan fell into deep thought.
 She had also indulged ever since she obtained Han Jue’s invincible power. However, because it was not her own power, she was not too fearless. However, she admitted that she was indeed very arrogant in that period of time.
 She couldn’t help but look at Han Jue. Even if her husband was invincible, he didn’t wreak havoc on all living beings. Instead, he maintained his original intention and stayed away from the mortal world.
 Thinking of this, Xing Hongxuan was filled with admiration for him.
 As expected of the man she liked. “Husband, do you have any thoughts of
 finding a new lover? Do you want me to help you?” Xing Hongxuan giggled.
 Han Jue shook his head and laughed. “Aren’t you afraid of losing favor?”
 “I’m not afraid. Besides, it’s useless even if
 I’m afraid. I might as well continue to please you.”
 Xing Hongxuan shrugged indifferently. The smartest thing about her was that she
 never interfered with Han Jue’s decisions. She also maintained a good relationship with his other women. She was the gel that bound them together.
 She knew very well that the difference between her and Han Jue was huge. It was impossible for her to restrain him. Could it be that she was like a mortal woman
 and insisted that Han Jue only had her?
 What if he was unwilling?
 Could she go look for other men?
 In that case, she would have long floated in
 the cycle of reincarnation for countless generations. Han Jue smiled. “There’s no need. Do you
 think the desires of the mortal world can still control me?”
 This was the truth. Unless he was touched, it
 was very difficult for Han Jue to like women
 because of his instincts. The love between men and women was no longer that important in his eyes. It was not as good as the joy brought by cultivation.
 As for being touched, with Han Jue’s strength,
 it was almost impossible for other women to touch him.
 The two of them chatted for a while more before Han Jue stood up and left. After interacting with the other women for a period
 of time, he returned to his Daoist temple. He did not enter cultivation immediately. Instead, he observed the blank domain and looked at Han Liang.
 After Han Liang left the third Dao Field, he first went to join Long Hao’s Dragon Court. Long Hao was pleasantly surprised by his arrival. For the next period of time, Han Liang
 would probably have to stay in the Dragon Court. It was also a good thing to have someone guide him.
 him in.
 Han Jue closed his eyes after watching for a while.
 Cultivation began!
 …
 Another ten million years passed.
 Han Jue opened his eyes. His cultivation level
 had increased a little, but overall, he had improved very little. Who knew how long it would take for him to break through? However, the improvement of the Creator
 Lord was also something that all living beings needed to spend countless years to accumulate.
 Han Jue was really not used to not seeing Han
 Liang when he opened his eyes.
 Han Jue felt that time had passed a little
 slowly ever since he interacted with his two grandsons. These tens of millions of years surpassed the hundreds of millions of years of memories.
 A disciple was waiting outside the Daoist temple. Murong Qi.
 Han Jue let him in.
 After entering the temple, Murong Qi first
 bowed and then went straight to the point. “Grandmaster, Fang Liang is missing. Do you know where he is?”
 the
 Murong Qi and Fang Liang were disciples of the same generation and had always been best brothers. At least, Murong Qi thought so. Han Jue said, “He went to the Origin Space-time to find a disciple who severed karma.”
 Origin Space-time? Murong Qi was stunned.
 “Ignore him. With your strength, you’ll be doomed if you go. Furthermore, he’s not in danger for the time being,” Han Jue said
 softly. Murong Qi nodded. “Other than that, there’s one more thing. We Chaotic Fiendcelestials have recently broken up, and each of us has established a force. I’m afraid this matter…”
 Han Jue said, “Let nature take its course. In the past, I nurtured you because I needed you
 to fight for me. Unfortunately, this opportunity didn’t arrive. Now, I don’t need you anymore. You can work hard for yourselves.” Murong Qi felt ashamed.
 They seemed to have never helped Han Jue
 since the beginning. Instead, Han Jue had saved them time and time again.
 If not for him, they wouldn’t be where they
 were today.
 Murong Qi began to kowtow in shame.
 a Dao Creator one day.” Murong Qi looked up. He was so excited that his arms trembled. He felt like his entire body
 was on fire.


 Han Jue quickly entered cultivation again.
 Chaos would ensue in the Endless Era since he released the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority. In the chaos, the Eternal Prodigy would appear, and a new Dao Creator would be born in advance.
 Han Jue didn’t deduce who would obtain this Great Dao Providence Divine Authority. He also wanted to leave himself some suspense.
 !!
 …
 After tens of millions of years of
 development.
 The Dao Mystic Realm developed rapidly. It was extremely vast and was no longer inferior to the current Heavenly Dao.
 Formless World obtained the Formless Transcendent Deity’s help and invested a lot of resources into the Dao Mystic Realm, attracting more and more cultivators.
 In a small world, the mountains undulated like the back of an ancient ferocious beast. It was vast and imposing.
 Chu Xiaoqi and Chen Jue sat side by side by the cliff, healing their injuries.
 Chu Xiaoqi suddenly opened his eyes and cursed, “Damn it. The more I think about it, the angrier I get. I have to kill him!”
 Chen Jue did not even open his eyes. “The other party is a Great Dao Sage and controls a major force. He has more than a thousand Freedom Realm cultivators under him. It’s impossible for us to kill him.”
 “So what if he’s a Great Dao Sage? Is he invincible?!”
 “So far, yes.”
 “Wait for me to call my master.”
 “You don’t even know who your master is. How can you call him?” Chen Jue opened his
 eyes and said in a strange tone.
 Chu Xiaoqi would brag every time they
 encountered danger. At first, Chen Jue
 believed it and even looked forward to it, but now, he no longer believed it.
 Chu Xiaoqi still wanted to quibble. Suddenly, the world shook and mountains ran.
 The two of them were attracted by the horizon and saw a majestic figure walk past the end of the horizon. The figure was like someone from beyond the heavens. It was ten million kilometers away. From the horizon to the top of the sea of clouds, only his waist was revealed. It was difficult to see his true
 appearance.
 The two of them were already at the Freedom Realm. Their gazes passed through the small world and saw the huge shadow’s true body. It was a mysterious man in sinister black armor. He had three heads and six arms and a pair of wings on his back. He was like an Asura Fiendcelestial patrolling his territory. They shivered as they felt his terrifying aura.
 They immediately hid their auras, afraid that
 they would be discovered.
 After a long while…
 The black-armored man left their vision, and Chu Xiaoqi heaved a sigh of relief.
 Chen Jue frowned and muttered, “What a
 powerful aura. To make Freedom so afraid, could it be a Great Dao Sage? He seems to be
 looking for something.”
 Chu Xiaoqi crossed her arms and thought, “It’s strange. We’ve encountered many Great
 Dao Sages recently. Could it be that
 something big is about to happen?”
 Chen Jue was also thinking.
 At the same time, in the void in the center of the Dao Mystic Realm, extremely far away from the two of them.
 A majestic palace hung in the void and
 emitted endless divine light. The light changed and was like a dream. Countless
 meteors floated in all directions. Every meteor was guarded, and the lowest was a million
 feet tall.
 In the hall.
 Formless World sat at the head of the table, smiling. His gaze landed on a man in the hall.
 Murong Qi!
 “Back then, the battle of the Ten Absolutes was very exciting. The geniuses of the future were still much inferior to us.” Formless World sighed.
 Compared to the Chaotic Assembly, he had
 lost his edge. He was more tactful and stable. Murong Qi smiled. “Of course. After hundreds of millions of years, Brother Formless already has the prestige to control the situation. I’m
 so envious.”
 Formless World laughed. “Fellow Daoist Murong, feel free to ask if you need the Dao
 Mystic Realm’s help.”
 He had always been passionate about the Hidden Sect because the Formless Transcendent Deity had reminded him. “I indeed need your help. I heard that the
 Great Dao Lake of the Dao Mystic Realm is a huge opportunity. I want to let my seven new disciples enter. What do you think?” Murong Qi asked with a smile.
 Formless World smiled. “Since Fellow Daoist
 Murong has spoken, I naturally allow it. It
 just so happens that the Dao Mystic Realm is preparing to hold a grand event like the Chaotic Assembly. The battle of the geniuses
 will decide the time in the Great Dao Lake
 based on the ranking. Why don’t you let your seven disciples participate? It’s a good opportunity to show the geniuses of the Dao
 Mystic Realm the glory of the outer world. I’ll let them in no matter their ranking. However, Fellow Daoist, you must tell them to take it seriously and not slack off.”
 Murong Qi smiled. “No problem.’ He cursed silently.
 He had just taken in his disciple and their
 cultivation level was not high. They would embarrass him if they lost.
 They continued to reminisce and became
 more familiar with each other, like brothers.
 after entering the Great Dao Lake. How could they miss such an opportunity?
 This event was created by the Realm Lord. Their enemies shouldn’t dare to act recklessly.
 At the same time, Formless World invited the various factions of the Endless Era to participate. The Dragon Court also received the news, and Long Hao brought Han Liang to
 the Dao Mystic Realm.
 Long Hao was high-spirited and felt that this
 was an opportunity for Han Liang and the Dragon Court to shine!
 He trusted Han Liang. With his strength, he would definitely be invincible below the Great Dao Supreme Realm!
 Han Liang was also looking forward to finally showing his edge!

 Spirit Stone, and a Primordial Fragment.]
 [You have obtained a Creation Heaven’s Chosen attempt.] Han Jue opened his eyes and silently chose
 the second option. The reward was the same, anyway.
 At this point, he had accumulated 20 Great
 Dao Fragments, 17 Creation Spirit Stones, 9 Primordial Fragments, 49 Creation Heaven’s Chosen attempts, 2 Heavenly Dao Spirit
 Stones, and 2 Ultimate Origin Spirit Stones. Han Jue took out nine Primordial Fragments and fused them. He wanted to improve his bloodline.
 [The Ultimate Origin Fiendcelestial is higher than the Primordial Great Creation. The nine
 Primordial Fragments can condense into one Ultimate Origin Fragment. You can obtain the Ultimate Origin Great Creation after gathering
 nine Ultimate Origin Fragments.] [Ultimate Origin Great Creation: You can create cultivation techniques, split the world, create races, and create everything.] It can do this?
 Han Jue raised his eyebrows.
 In other words, one Ultimate Origin Great
 Creation required 81 Primordial Fragments, which was equivalent to 8.1 billion years.
 No, after a billion years, he would definitely only receive a reward once every billion years. In other words, it would take tens of billions of years.
 Han Jue was a little dissatisfied. “You and I
 are already so powerful. Why do you have to
 restrict us?”
 [Everything has an extreme number. It’s the same for Great Creation. However, as the karma of creation develops, the extreme number will also constantly increase.]
