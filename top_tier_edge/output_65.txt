 Long Hao and Han Yu waved their Dharmic powers and struck the black mist, wanting to disperse it. However, their Dharmic powers were neutralized.
 They could only watch as Qin Ling was drowned by the black aura. Then, it instantly disappeared along with Qin Ling. “What’s happening?”
 Han Yu frowned and panicked.
 Qin Ling was the grand-disciple he had watched grow up, the person he doted on the most!
 !!
 Long Hao looked at the Ancient Desolate and said, “Qin Ling should have been captured. We can only barge in and take a look.”
 Han Yu immediately rushed into the Ancient Desolate without hesitation.
 Long Hao followed closely behind.
 The two of them rushed into the Ancient Desolate and disappeared into the boundless mist.
  The Great Dao Tower slowly advanced in the endless void. The cities and islands in all directions seemed to be protecting them with a magnificent aura.
 Zhou Fan stood in front of a huge bronze mirror. Mo Fuchou stood beside him.
 The scene in the mirror was the Ancient Desolate.
 Mo Fuchou asked, “What have you been looking at in the Ancient Desolate for the past few days?”
 Zhou Fan came back to his senses and smiled. “From the outside, there doesn’t seem to be anything special about the Ancient Desolate. However, for tens of thousands of years, geniuses often disappeared near the Ancient Desolate. With my talent, I’m afraid I’ll disappear if I go.”
 Mo Fuchou rolled his eyes. This fellow was so arrogant.
 Zhou Fan immediately felt awkward.
 He had hidden his relationship with Han Jue in the past, making Mo Fuchou very unhappy. Now, he often used this matter to mock him.
 Mo Fuchou asked curiously, “Does your master know about this?”
 Zhou Fan said, “Of course I know, but his target is the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit. Right now is the time for us small soldiers to play. When our battle ends will be the time for peerless mighty figures like them to decide the winner.”
 He talked about the past few Heavenly Dao calamities and how Han Jue had turned the tide.
 Mo Fuchou sighed.
 “He’s still the same person. Back then, when the Jade Pure Sacred Sect fought with the Cult, he didn’t take the initiative to attack. He only attacked when the enemy reached the mountain gate.”
 Zhou Fan nodded.
 “Although I disagree with this method, from Master’s point of view, he only wants to cultivate in peace. It’s all others who cause trouble for him. It’s already very good that he makes a move.” Zhou Fan shook his head and laughed.
 Mo Fuchou asked, “You mean that Han Jue will only attack when the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit reaches the Heavenly Dao?”
 Mo Fuchou felt that it made sense.
 Time passed quickly.
 In the Daoist temple, three lines of words appeared in front of Han Jue, who was meditating.
 [Detected that you are eight million years old and your life has taken another step forward. You have the following choices:]
 [1: Exit seclusion immediately and annex the Seven Supreme Rules. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment, a Primordial Fragment, a Creation Spirit Stone, and a Heavenly Dao Spirit Stone.]
 [2: Cultivate in a low-profile manner and stay away from trouble. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment, a Primordial Fragment, and a Creation Spirit Stone.)
 Annex the Seven Supreme Rules?
 Han Jue shook his head.
 Wasn’t that courting death? Ancestor Tian Xu wanted to do this, but he was stopped by Laozi.
 Would a Dao Creator make a move if he tried to do the same?
  How could the Ninth Chaos sit by and watch others devour its Chaos?
 Han Jue silently chose the second option.
 (You chose to cultivate in a low-profile manner and obtained a Great Dao Fragment, a Primordial Fragment, and a Creation Spirit Stone.]
 He began a new round of Primordial Fragment collection!
 Han Jue still looked forward to it.
 He took out the Creation Spirit Stone and fused it with a ball of Fiendcelestial Qi.
 Then, he paid attention to the Primordial World.
 “Perhaps I can save the Creation Spirit Stones in the future,” Han Jue thought silently.
 If Han Jue needed to rely on the power of the Fiendcelestial Army, it meant that he was already weak or in a desperate situation.
 The three thousand Fiendcelestials were still useful. They would help him control the Primordial Chaos and protect the Heavenly Dao in the future.
 The current Primordial World was extremely vast. It would catch up to the Chaos sooner or later.
 However, the Primordial World was independent of his soul and still could not jump out of the Chaos. If he wanted to surpass the Chaos, the Primordial World and the Chaos would probably face each other sooner or later.
 However, that was in the future!
 Han Jue suddenly thought of Huang’er’s million-year birthday and immediately sent a voice transmission to him.
 Soon, Han Huang came to his Daoist temple and bowed.
 The Divine Robe Daoist was really talkative. This was also good. It was also a good thing that Han Huang could understand the Chaos in advance.
 Han Jue said, “I don’t care. We’ll see when we fight.”
 Han Huang added, “I heard that many geniuses of the Chaos were captured by the Ancient Desolate, including a Heavenly Dao Sage. By the way, one of your descendants was also captured. The Divine Robe Daoist told me. He said that his name is Han Yu? Yes, Han Yu!”
 Han Jue frowned.
 Although he usually ignored Han Yu, this was still his descendant and a Sage he supported. How could he sit by and watch?
 He checked his interpersonal relationships and discovered that Han Yu’s portrait was still there.
 He checked his emails again.
 Not only Han Yu. Qin Ling, Long Hao, Zhou Fan, and Mo Fuchou were also captured.
 [Your disciple Long Hao was possessed by your enemy, the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit. His will has been sealed.]
 It was the same email.
 Just like Dao Sovereign.
  What did the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit want?
 Han Jue asked in his mind, “Will the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit kill them after possessing the prodigies?”
 (100 trillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [No]
 Indeed.
 The Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit wanted to control and be the Lord of Chaos. He naturally could not kill all the Chaotic Prodigies.
 Han Jue wasn’t afraid. He could use the system’s Absolute Purification to release them.
 “Father, what are you thinking? Are you going to deal with the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit? When? Where? I want to watch the battle!” Han Huang asked excitedly. How impressive would that be if the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit that terrified the Great Dao Sages died under his father’s hands!


 “I didn’t say that I wanted to fight. The Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit is indeed powerful. I still have to cultivate for a while before I can fight it.”
 Han Huang nodded. “I’m not a fool. I know what to say and what not to say.”
 Han Jue was relieved.
 !!
 Han Huang asked, “Father, this time, do you have to wait until the enemy reaches the Heavenly Dao before you make a move if the Chaotic mighty figures can’t stop it?”
 Han Jue frowned. “Why do you say that?”
 “Those Great Dao Sages said that you won’t leave the Heavenly Dao. You have to wait until you have no choice before attacking.”
 Han Jue frowned even harder when he heard this.
  Why did he smell a trap?
 He pinched his fingers to deduce.
 Indeed!
 A group of living beings was stirring up trouble. They said that the Divine Might Heavenly Sage would only attack when he was attacked.
 These living beings had all been to the Ancient Desolate and were most likely being controlled by the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit.
 Could it be that the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit wanted to provoke him to attack early?
 It was very likely!
 It seemed that this Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit was not stupid.
 After all, Han Jue’s Dao Field could not be spied on. There was clearly something fishy.
 “Don’t care about what others say. I’ll teach you something today. If what you heard was deliberately spread by the enemy, what do you think will happen?” Han Jue asked meaningfully.
 Han Huang immediately frowned.
 He tried to think. If it were him, he would definitely not be able to take it and would directly seek revenge from the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit.
 It was an eye-opener for him to scheme against the enemy like this.
 He was still not strong enough. What were these schemes as long as he was powerful enough?
 Han Huang’s eyes became firm.
 He looked at Han Jue and said, “Father, I will definitely sweep away all the powerful enemies for you when I reach the Supreme Realm. Whoever dares to say that they’re not convinced will die!”
 Han Jue smiled, “I believe in your filial piety. I called you here today because you’re about to turn a million years old. What wish do you have? I’ve never satisfied you since you were young.” Han Huang’s eyes lit up. “What about Qing’er?”
 Han Jue shook his head.
 “Then if you satisfy me, won’t Qing’er be even more unhappy? I can feel that my potential gives her a lot of pressure. If you favor me, she will be even more unhappy. Why don’t you satisfy her wish? Don’t mention the million-year birthday and directly reward us. Then, pretend that you suddenly remembered I’m already a million years old,” Han Huang said seriously, making Han Jue very glad.
 No matter how strong Han Huang was, he would always care about Han Qing’er. Han Jue was naturally glad that the siblings were so close.
 Han Jue smiled. “Call Qing’er in.”
 “Alright!”
 Han Huang immediately turned around.
 Han Jue suddenly realized that he had indeed neglected his daughter. Back then, when his daughter was born, she was like a treasure. But later, after Han Huang was born, his attention was diverted.
 He was really not a good father.
 No, that’s not true!
 He had spent twenty years watching his daughter grow up. How could parents still pay attention to their daughter after she grew up?
 Han Jue consoled himself.
 Even if he was not the best father, he was definitely not a bad father.
 He had given Han Qing’er care that surpassed all living beings!
  Han Jue began to check his emails and waited for his children to arrive.
 Not long after, Han Qing’er and Han Huang arrived.
 “Father!”
 The two of them bowed together. Han Qing’er looked excited and expectant.
 Her father rarely called her. Could there really be something good?
 Han Jue smiled. “My cultivation has improved greatly. I’m in a good mood and have decided to satisfy each of your wishes. What do you want?”
 Han Qing’er was pleasantly surprised and couldn’t help but look at her brother.
 Han Huang smiled and said, “Qing’er, tell me. I’ll give you my wish.”
 “Then don’t regret it!”
 Han Qing’er chuckled and did not stand on ceremony.
 Han Huang smiled and nodded.
 Han Jue showed a frown.
 He asked in his mind, “If I let Han Qing’er and Han Huang out, will they be captured by a Dao Creator?”
 (1 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [No]
 Han Jue secretly heaved a sigh of relief.
 It was fine as long as he was not targeted by a Dao Creator.
 Tsk tsk, even Han Huang’s potential could not attract a Dao Creator?
 What kind of existence was a Dao Creator? What kind of vision did he have?
 Han Jue said in a low voice, “Recently, the Ancient Desolate and the Heavenly Dao have been in trouble. Even if you go out, you can’t go to the Ancient Desolate. Don’t cause trouble for me. If you are captured by the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit and used to threaten me, I won’t save you. At most, I’ll make another son and daughter.”
 Han Qing’er had heard about the Ancient Desolate from Han Huang. She hurriedly promised, “We definitely won’t go there. I just want to see the Chaos. If there’s really no way, let us out of the Dao Field. We’ll stay in the universe of stars, alright?”
 Han Jue said in a low voice, “That’s feasible.”
 He looked at Han Huang. “You can’t pester Jiang Jueshi endlessly. Don’t bully him now that your cultivation level has already surpassed his.”
 “I understand. Who do you think I am?” Han Huang retorted angrily. His father always thought that he was reckless and unreasonable.
 Han Jue smiled.
 The siblings were about to go out today, so he waved his hand to send them out.
 After his children left, Han Jue left a wisp of his will to keep an eye on them. Then, he closed his eyes and started cultivating.
 Cultivation was the most important!
 In a dark cave.
  The Evil Heavenly Emperor was circulating his energy to heal his injuries. The War Buddha was in front of him, waiting.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor did not even open his eyes as he said, “Let’s rest first. Ancestor Tian Xu was severely injured. The Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit is also restrained by my help. Now, we have to hurry up and recover our Dharmic powers.”
 The War Buddha sat down and circulated his energy to heal his injuries. He asked, “Your Majesty, who attacked earlier? A Great Dao Sage? There seems to be more than one.”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor smiled. “A Great Dao Sage and an existence that surpasses the Great Dao Sage Realm. Otherwise, why would I dare to lead so many geniuses to the Ancient Desolate? The geniuses are only bait. Destroying Ancestor Tian Xu and the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit is the goal. Kill them and those trapped geniuses will naturally be fine.”
 The War Buddha was enlightened.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor opened his eyes and said, “There must be a huge opportunity in this Ancient Desolate. Otherwise, it’s impossible for the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit to create endless Dao Devils. The Heavenly Court will definitely rise if we obtain this opportunity and create endless Dao Devils as Heavenly Soldiers,” he said excitedly.
 The War Buddha’s eyes lit up.
 So His Majesty was targeting the Dao Devils!
 “Those Dao Devils are indeed impressive.” The War Buddha sighed.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor closed his eyes and said faintly, “Prepare well. Soon, the Ancient Desolate will shatter. The unknown existence will attack. It depends on whether the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit can withstand it!”


 Time passed quickly.
 A hundred thousand years later.
 Han Jue opened his eyes.
 Han Huang and Han Qing’er returned after playing in the universe of stars for a few years. They got to know Jiang Jueshi and Liu Bei during this time. The first batch of Connate lifeforms began to be born in the universe of stars, making them a feast for the eyes.
 !!
 Han Jue didn’t care about the living beings in the universe of stars. He left them to Liu Bei.
 In the past, he wanted Qingluan’er to take over, but he discovered that she was not interested in this matter. She was more like a salted fish and did not want to shoulder too much burden. Han Jue simply handed it all to Liu Bei.
 “Hmph.”
 Han Jue exhaled and stood up. Then, he went to the Daoist temple in the Hundred Peak Immortal River, jumped to the 33rd Heaven, and entered the Universal Hall.
  Han Jue’s arrival alerted Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du, who immediately sent a voice transmission to the other Sages calling them
 over.
 Han Jue sat beside Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du and the two of them began to chat.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du began to talk after the other Sages arrived.
 “The Ancient Desolate has been in chaos during this period of time. Some mighty figures have slaughtered their way into the Ancient Desolate for their genius disciples. Some powerful forces also sent troops, including the Chaotic Heavenly Court and Life. According to the reply of the Sage in charge of investigating the Ancient Desolate, three thousand years ago, a mysterious mighty figure attacked and split the Ancient Desolate into two with a palm.”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du’s words echoed in the hall. Everyone was moved.
 Han Jue immediately pinched his fingers to deduce.
 The Ancient Desolate was indeed slashed into two, but it was not a devastating destruction. The mysterious power that enveloped the Ancient Desolate had yet to dissipate.
 Wow.
 The Ancient Desolate was about to suffer!
 Now that the Chaos was peaceful and the Ultimate God of Punishment did not take sides for the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit, it naturally attracted the anger of the Chaos.
 It seemed that the Chaos could buy Han Jue time again.
 Currently, Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du sounded powerful, but Han Jue felt that the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit wouldn’t collapse just like that.
 The Heavenly Dao would have to face the Ancient Desolate sooner or later!
 After Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du finished speaking, Pan Xin was the first to curse. “The Ancient Desolate really deserves to die. I hope that before the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit can take revenge, it will be trampled down by the various forces of the Chaos!”
 Sect Master Tian Jue frowned. “How can the captured Heavenly Dao Sage be saved if the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit is defeated in advance?”
 The Sages pondered and then looked at Han Jue.
 The strongest in the Heavenly Dao was the Divine Might Heavenly Sage. At this time, he still had to make the decision.
 This was also the reason why Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du waited for him to arrive before speaking. The Foolish Sword Sage said, “Let me go. I want to see how strong that Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit is!”
 His gaze landed on Han Jue.
 Now that he had already joined the Heavenly Dao, he felt that he should show off. Besides, he had recently mastered his cultivation and wanted to find someone to test his sword before challenging Han Jue.
 Han Jue frowned, worried that he would die.
 The Foolish Sword Sage snorted. “Don’t worry, I’m confident!”
 Red Fate covered her mouth and laughed. “Since the Foolish Sword Sage is confident, let him go. In any case, there are other mighty figures in the Ancient Desolate now. If he goes early, we can still join forces.”
 Han Jue hesitated for a moment but still nodded.
 It would also be a good thing if these mighty figures could really destroy the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit’s plan.
  There was no need for him to do it personally every time.
 The Foolish Sword Sage immediately stood up and disappeared.
 The Sages looked at each other. They did not expect the Foolish Sword Sage to go just like that.
 With that said, all the Sages exploded.
 Qiu Xilai asked, “Will this weaken the power of the Heavenly Dao and diminish the Chaotic Heavenly Roads’ strength?”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “Indeed, but it’s only for the time being. During this period of time, all of you will guard your own Chaotic Heavenly Road. The reason why I want to increase my cultivation level is not only for me and all of you but also for the Heavenly Dao. The Heavenly Dao develops extremely quickly, but the Heavenly Dao Sages’ strength is a little weak. You should understand that you can’t rely on the Heavenly Sage and the three Great Dao Sages for everything. They want to cultivate and break through to a higher realm. The Heavenly Dao is a ship. We have to contribute to benefit from it.”
 The Sages nodded.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du looked at Han Jue. He had to make the decision.
 Han Jue felt that Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du made sense. The Heavenly Dao Sages were indeed too weak.
 It just so happened that the Ancient Desolate couldn’t free itself. This was an opportunity.
 He nodded. “This matter will be personally arranged by Fellow Daoist Xuan Du.”
 It was fine even if something happened to the Heavenly Dao during this period of time. He could protect it.
 Otherwise, it would be meaningless.
 An existence stronger than Han Jue could directly break through the power of the Heavenly Dao. There was no need to wait for the Heavenly Dao to weaken.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du heaved a sigh of relief.
 He was really afraid that Han Jue would refuse. This would embarrass him too much.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du mentioned a few more things. After making arrangements, Han Jue left.
 The Sages heaved a sigh of relief.
 “Indeed. I still feel pressured even if he doesn’t speak.”
 “I feel that the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit is not the Heavenly Sage’s match.”
 “Definitely not in the future, but it’s hard to say now. Otherwise, the Heavenly Sage wouldn’t be busy cultivating.”
  Before leaving, Murong Qi said that the Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial was preparing to attain the Great Dao.
 Han Jue chatted with Dao Comprehension Sword and Li Yao for several hours before returning to the third Dao Field.
 He first calculated the time when the Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial would break through. Then, he sent a voice transmission to Han Huang and asked him to receive him when the time came to prevent anyone from suppressing the Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial and stopping his breakthrough.
 Han Huang immediately agreed. He had a deep impression of the Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial. When he heard that it was about to break through, he was very excited, as if he was about to break through himself.
 Han Jue continued cultivating.
 More than 34,000 years later.
 In front of the Great Dao Door.
 The Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial slowly walked over.
 Looking at the door of the Great Dao ahead, his eyes revealed excitement.


 “I can attain the Great Dao after opening this door!”
 The Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial’s eyes burned with a ferocious aura. Although it looked like a human, its figure emitted the hostility of a ferocious beast.
 He came to the door of the Great Dao and placed his palms on it, then began to push with all his might. The Heavenly Constellation’s domineering power erupted, directly shaking the Great Dao Door.
 “Oh? I didn’t expect a Connate Chaotic Fiendcelestial to be hidden in the Chaos!”
 !!
 A surprised voice sounded, causing the Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial to frown.
 He didn’t expect to be discovered by others when breaking through.
 Could it be that this was not his consciousness but an independent breakthrough space?
 “Fellow Daoist, this person is my good friend. Give me face!”
  A voice came from the other side of the Great Dao Door. It was Han Huang.
 The Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial was moved upon hearing his voice. This kid has already attained the Great Dao?
 “I see. I was just curious. Sorry to disturb
 you.”
 The mysterious voice smiled and disappeared.
 He quickly walked in and saw Han Huang looking at him in the darkness with a smile.
 The Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial asked, “What was that just now?”
 Han Huang smiled. “It’s nothing. With me around, no one will hurt you.”
 The Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial understood immediately and cupped his fists. “Thank you!”
 “Don’t thank me! Consolidate your cultivation first. We’ll talk later.”
 “Alright!”
 The Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial closed his eyes and began to sense the power of the Great Dao.
 Han Huang smiled.
 He finally had an opponent!
 He had already decided to fight thirty thousand rounds with the Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial in the simulation trial!
 Inside the Daoist temple.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and a glint flashed across his red pupils.
 A Chaotic Fiendcelestial was finally born in his Primordial World. He had already moved the Chaotic Fiendcelestial fused with the Creation Spirit Stone out of the Primordial World. This meant that this new Chaotic Fiendcelestial would be the Primordial World’s first Connate lifeform!
 Life Fiendcelestial!
 The Fiendcelestial representing vitality!
 This was the key to the Primordial World transforming into reality!
 The successfully nurtured Life Fiendcelestial curled up in a corner and instinctively absorbed the nebulous Primordial Qi. It had no intention of exploring for the time being.
 The Life Fiendcelestial’s birth caused the Primordial World to expand several times again. Han Jue also felt the Great Dao of Life appear in the Primordial World and build the first rule for it.
 Han Jue was in an extremely good mood.
 He had found the right path of cultivation.
 Very likely!
 The Ninth Chaos might be such a Dao Creator.
 But what about the other four Dao Creators?
 Could it be that they also had their own worlds?
 This might be the reason why they did not pay attention to the Chaos.
 Just like Han Jue, they wouldn’t care even if the Chaos was destroyed.
 Han Jue felt that it was really possible.
 As he guessed, he stared at the Life Fiendcelestial.
 He could speed up the time in the Primordial World, but the Life Fiendcelestial was too powerful, causing his nebulous Primordial Qi to be insufficient. Therefore, he decided to make the time in the Primordial World equal to the Chaos.
 Time could be controlled to speed up and slow down, but the energy was constant.
 The speed at which the Primordial World produced nebulous Primordial Qi would not increase because of time.
 Several days later.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and started to check his emails.
 [Your good friend Evil Heavenly Emperor was enlightened by a mysterious mighty figure. His cultivation has increased greatly.]
  (Your good friend Foolish Sword Sage was attacked by your enemy, Ancestor Tian Xu. He was severely injured.)
 (Your good friend Foolish Sword Sage was attacked by your enemy, the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit. He was severely injured.)
 (Your disciple Zhao Xuanyuan was attacked by a mysterious Dao Devil) x1098222
 (Your good friend Jiang Yi was attacked by a mysterious Dao Devil) x1100874
 (Your good friend Lao Dan received a dream from a mysterious mighty figure. His cultivation has increased.]
 [Your good friend Di Jiang was attacked by your enemy, Ancestor Tian Xu. He was severely injured.]
 So many attacks and heavy injuries!
 The entire circle of friends seemed to be participating in the crusade against the Ancient Desolate.
 Han Jue raised his eyebrows when he saw an email.
 (Your enemy, the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit, was attacked by a transcendent existence. The Ancient Desolate’s providence was severed.]
 Transcendent existence! Who was that?
 Han Jue asked in his mind.
 (1 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [Formless Transcendent Deity]
 It was him!
 Han Jue narrowed his eyes.
 The Dao Creator attacked.
 The meaning changed.
 Han Jue asked in his mind, “Will the Dao Creator attack me if I kill the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit?”
 (1 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [No]
 Han Jue secretly heaved a sigh of relief.
 It seemed that the Dao Creator was still reasonable. The Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit was too arrogant, which made the Dao Creator unhappy.
 Han Jue shouldn’t be targeted by the Dao Creator as long as he didn’t show any ambition towards the Chaos.
 Han Jue had such a mentality. The Chaos was vast. It was fine to give birth to geniuses and mighty figures. He couldn’t be bothered as long as it didn’t affect him.
 “Why didn’t the Formless Transcendent Deity kill the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit?”
 [It involves karma that cannot be deduced.]
 Unable to deduce?
 Dao Ancestor?
 No, the Dao Ancestor might not be stronger than the Formless Transcendent Deity. Otherwise, he would not have to disappear.
 Ninth Chaos!
 It seemed that the Ninth Chaos’ restrictions on the Dao Creator exceeded Han Jue’s expectations.
 Just as Han Jue was thinking, another uninvited guest came from outside the universe of stars.
 This aura was very familiar!
 Divine Lord Peacock!
 Why was this fellow here?
 Jiang Jueshi also sensed Divine Lord Peacock’s aura and immediately arrived outside the universe of stars to stop him.
  Divine Lord Peacock stepped on the Five-colored Divine Light. His clothes were gorgeous and he looked imposing, like an immortal lord wandering the universe.
 He sized up Jiang Jueshi and clicked his tongue in wonder. “I didn’t expect this universe to have a Great Dao Sage guarding
 it.”
 Jiang Jueshi frowned. “Fellow Daoist, please take a detour. This universe has just given birth to a spirit. It can’t withstand your pressure.”
 “I’ve been traveling the Chaos for a long time and want to find a place to enter seclusion. Let’s do it here. Your aura is different from this universe. It’s clearly unrelated to you. You just came early. We won’t disturb each other. How about that?” Divine Lord Peacock raised his chin and said proudly.
 He didn’t care about Jiang Jueshi at all.
 Jiang Jueshi frowned even more. He raised his right palm and said, “Don’t blame me for being impolite if you insist on being stubborn.”
 Jiang Jueshi knew that things wouldn’t end well when he heard that. Thus, he immediately attacked.
 Divine Might Great Heaven Palm!


 Facing Jiang Jueshi’s Divine Might Great Heaven Palm, five-colored divine light rose from Divine Lord Peacock’s back and swept towards him.
 The two unparalleled Mystical Powers collided!
 The Five-Colored Divine Light was directly destroyed!
 Divine Lord Peacock’s expression changed drastically. He immediately dodged. The Divine Might Great Heaven Palm attacked. Space collapsed and Chaotic Qi surged wantonly, like a world-destroying wind sweeping through the darkness. Their Dharmic powers passed through the colorful spatial turbulence and collided, causing space to collapse again and a deeper space to appear.
 How world-shattering was their battle? Everyone in the third Dao Field was alarmed.
 Han Huang came to Han Qing’er’s side and looked up to watch the battle.
 “That person is also a Great Dao Sage? So strong!” Han Qing’er asked nervously. Previously, she and Han Huang were already familiar with Jiang Jueshi when she had been traveling the universe of stars for a few years. They both treated him as their senior brother and naturally did not want him to lose, much less see anything happen to him.
 Han Huang said with a solemn expression, “That’s right. The other party’s cultivation is stronger than Senior Jiang’s. His Mystical Power is also very impressive. If not for Senior Jiang having the Divine Might Great Heaven Palm, I’m afraid it would be difficult to resist.”
 Han Qing’er found it impressive that he could create a Mystical Power in battle.
 How talented was he?
 Several days later.
 Jiang Jueshi and Divine Lord Peacock stopped.
 Neither side looked severely injured, but Jiang Jueshi’s expression was ugly.
 “This person is so strong!” Jiang Jueshi thought silently.
 Divine Lord Peacock thought the same, and he felt even more pressure.
 “If we continue fighting and I lose, won’t it cause trouble for the Dark Forbidden Lord?”
 Thinking of this, Divine Lord Peacock narrowed his eyes and laughed arrogantly. “Kid, your potential is indeed not bad, but unfortunately, you met me. Compared to me, you’re still far inferior. You would be dead if not for the mighty figure in this universe!”
 With that, Divine Lord Peacock fled and vanished in the blink of an eye.
 Jiang Jueshi was moved and his expression darkened.
 The other party could see through his master’s existence. This alone proved that he was stronger than him!
 Little did he know that Divine Lord Peacock was only making excuses.
 After confirming that Divine Lord Peacock would not return, Jiang Jueshi turned around and returned to his cultivation place.
 He did not blame Divine Lord Peacock. Although the Chaos was huge, it was not easy to find a stable place to cultivate. Especially for the number one prodigy of the Chaos like Divine Lord Peacock, he had too many enemies and his backing was the Dark Forbidden Lord. He naturally ran into trouble everywhere.
 In the Dark Chaos.
 The Ancient Desolate that had been slashed into two was like two neighboring continents. At this moment, countless living beings had already gathered around it. They raised their flags and represented different factions. Even Great Dao Divine Spirits were participating. In terms of factions, there were already more than a thousand, let alone all the cultivators. That was a terrifying number.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor stood at the top of a magnificent silver palace and looked at the Ancient Desolate from afar.
 The War Buddha and Black Heaven General suddenly appeared.
 “Your Majesty, I’ve found traces of Tower Master Zhou. However, he and hundreds of geniuses are patrolling the Ancient Desolate. They are all at the Freedom Realm. I don’t dare to approach them,” Black Heaven General said in a low voice.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor did not reply. Instead, he continued to look at the Ancient Desolate.
 The two Divine Generals did not disturb him anymore and waited patiently.
 After a long while…
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor slowly said, “The Ancient Desolate is difficult to conquer. I guess there will be a huge change next.”
 The War Buddha asked, “Aren’t you going to save Tower Master Zhou? There are also the geniuses who follow the Heavenly Court.”
 “Of course I have to save him, but I can’t force it. I’m waiting for someone to arrive.”
 “Who?”
 The War Buddha and Black Heaven General were curious.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor’s connections were immeasurable. The mysterious mighty figure who had severed the Ancient Desolate was invited by the Evil Heavenly Emperor. Unfortunately, the other party had only attacked once.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor narrowed his eyes and said softly, “Laozi.”
 The War Buddha and Black Heaven General were moved.
 Another hundred thousand years passed.
 Han Jue’s cultivation improved again, but there was no sign of a breakthrough for the time being
 Even the Ultimate Origin Fiendcelestial could not cultivate to perfection in hundreds of thousands of years at the Great Dao Supreme Realm. After all, a Chaotic Fiendcelestial might not be able to cultivate to the Great Dao Supreme Realm.
 After ending his cultivation, he first observed the Life Fiendcelestial.
 The Life Fiendcelestial began to explore the Primordial World.
 The Primordial World was almost endless to him. When he could not find other living beings, he would stop and continue cultivating
 Han Jue had an idea. He wanted to nurture the Life Fiendcelestial into a deity of the Primordial World and enchant it in the future.
 Therefore, he secretly gave the Life Fiendcelestial some Dao technique insights.
 Han Jue wasn’t afraid that the Life Fiendcelestial would surpass him. The Primordial World belonged to him. The Life Fiendcelestial had already fused with the Primordial World. It was impossible for it to be stronger than the Primordial World, let alone surpass Han Jue. He could even use the power of the Primordial World to crush the Life Fiendcelestial.
 Han Jue observed for a while before continuing to cultivate. The Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit was still a thorn in his heart. He had to break through as soon as possible and kill it!
 Year after year passed.
 Ever since Divine Lord Peacock, no mighty figure had attacked the universe of stars. Occasionally, cultivators would pass by, but they would hurriedly escape after sensing Jiang Jueshi’s powerful aura.
 In the blink of an eye.
 Four hundred thousand years passed.
 Han Jue’s cultivation level increased greatly. Although he didn’t break through, he felt that his strength had doubled. The accumulation of the Ultimate Origin Power would actually produce a qualitative change. His Ultimate Origin Power doubled in 400,000 years.
  The Ultimate Origin Power seemed to have no limit!
 Ordinary Supreme Dharmic powers would directly disperse when they collided with the current Ultimate Origin Power. In other words, a Great Dao Supreme could barely do anything to him.
 Han Jue asked in his mind, “Can I insta-kill the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit now?”
 (100 trillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [No]
 Han Jue showed a frown.
 “What are my chances of winning against the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit?”
 [80% chance of winning)
 Han Jue frowned even more.
