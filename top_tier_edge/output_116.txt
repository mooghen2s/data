 Han Jue thought that might be true.
 The blank domain could indeed give birth to a will. His system was the blank domain’s
 Creation Will, but that will had once told him that the blank domain itself was no longer under its control. In the future, it might resist him or even reject him.
 In that case, the white-haired man’s identity could be confirmed.
 Apart from the will avatar of the blank domain, Han Jue couldn’t think of anyone who could threaten him for the time being.
 Unless another Ultimate Origin Fiendcelestial or stronger existence was born in the future.
 “Since it’s in the future, let’s just wait,” Han Jue said calmly.
 The Ninth Chaos nodded.
 The dream ended.
 Han Jue continued to look at the blank domain and the experiences of all living beings, as if he was experiencing them. Even the Creator Lord liked to imagine.
 Han Jue grew bored after some time passed. He prepared to extend his seclusion period.
 A billion years!
 In any case, he had already faded in the eyes of all living beings. No matter how long he entered seclusion, it could not change anything. He wasn’t interested in interfering with all living beings.
 Transcendent Divine Hall.
 They looked at the door side by side. A strong light filled the entrance of the hall, and they could not see everything outside.
 The Chaotic Consciousness smiled. After
 putting down their ambitions, their
 relationship had softened greatly in the past
 billions of years. They returned to their previous state and smiled at the rise and fall of
 all living beings.
 The Ninth Chaos said indifferently, “It should be the Dao Ancestor. He had hope before, but…”
 He did not finish. The four Dao Creators knew what he meant.
 The Chaotic Consciousness and the Formless Transcendent Deity believed that the Dao Ancestor would succeed first.
 A Dao Creator could not deduce other Dao
 Dao Ancestor and Han Huang could both succeed. It was just a question of who would succeed first.
 After a long time.
 A terrifying aura descended, shaking the
 Transcendent Divine Hall.
 A figure walked into the hall in the strong light.
 It was the Dao Ancestor.
 The Dao Ancestor wore a Daoist robe and had white hair. He held a horsetail whisk in his hand and a thread formed by the three thousand Great Dao in the other.
 Looking at him, other than the Ninth Chaos,
 the four Dao Creators were a little stunned.
 They did not expect to be wrong. Only the Ninth Chaos was right.
 The Dao Ancestor stopped in front of them and cupped his hands. “I’m Hong Jun. Greetings,
 fellow Daoists.”
 Fellow Daoists!
 The five Dao Creators sighed. Yes, they would be on the same level in the future.
 Another terrifying aura descended before they could speak. Han Huang walked into the hall.
 He wore a green robe and no longer had any hostility. His temperament was restrained, and it was difficult to associate him with the
 Primordial Fiendcelestial.
 The Dao Ancestor looked at him and smiled. “You’re here, fellow Daoist.”
 Han Huang smiled faintly. “You’re indeed faster. To us, it doesn’t matter who’s faster as long as it’s the same day.”
 The Dao Ancestor smiled and nodded.
 The two of them did not have a confrontational
 atmosphere, as if they had been good friends for many years.
 The Formless Transcendent Deity smiled and
 asked, “Where are Primordial Origin and Huang Zuntian?”
 Han Huang smiled and said, “They’re still consolidating their cultivation. They sent me in advance to meet you.”
 From today onwards, he would officially step
 into the circle of Dao Creators!
 He looked calm, but he was still a little excited
 inside.
 He looked around and asked curiously, “Where’s the Lord?”
 The Dao Creators were all here. Why didn’t his
 Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction Venerable smiled. “This is the domain of a Dao Creator.
 As for your father, he’s not a Dao Creator. He has reached a higher realm.”
 Han Huang was stunned before shaking his head and laughing.
 He was not surprised. Instead, he felt that it made sense to obtain the true answer.
 The seven Dao Creators sat down and began to
 discuss the Dao.
 Every Dao Creator walked a different path. It
 was beneficial to discuss the Dao with each
 other.
 Era.
 Han Jue also ended his seclusion. This seclusion lasted for a billion years.
 He opened his eyes and sighed as he looked at
 the rapidly expanding Primordial Chaos and Chaos.
 It was a little earlier than the future he predicted. The future kept changing, and Han Jue could also follow the changes. However, he was busy cultivating in the past first billion
 years.
 He looked carefully. So the future only suffered a change because the Primordial Chaos and Chaos were catalyzed by the basic rules.
 It was unknown if it was a coincidence or the
 Endless Era’s creation, but the basic rules were drilled into their Great Dao Worlds when they condensed seven Supreme Rules, making them stronger.
 The current them were stronger than the Chaotic Consciousness and the others when they had just entered the Dao Creator, but not that much stronger. Han Jue looked at the future. The third Dao
 Creator of the Endless Era would be born in four billion years. There was no doubt that it would be Han Ling.
 The sequence changed a little after that. It actually became Han Liang.
 He was indeed blessed with the support of two
 Dao Creators.
 Han Jue stood up and walked out of the Daoist
 temple.
 At this moment, the Dao Companions were gathered in Xing Hongxuan’s Daoist temple to celebrate Han Huang’s successful attainment of
 the Dao. They didn’t notice him.
 As long as Han Jue didn’t reveal his aura, no
 one could sense him.
 Chang Yue’er smiled. “Han Tuo will be here soon.”
 “Next is Ling’er.”
 “Probably. In any case, Qing’er and Yunjin
 won’t have a chance.”
 “Speaking of my grandson, Heavenly Venerate Xun and Chu Xiaoqi are at odds. As his grandmother, do you want to resolve it?” The women discussed passionately. Xing Hongxuan’s temperament was the most outstanding. Her identity as the Prominent Divine Dream Mother had absorbed too many faiths. She was already a god.
 Even Li Yao, who had the most outstanding cultivation, was a little ordinary in front of her.
 The women looked at him in surprise and immediately surrounded him. His arms were instantly pulled each way.
 He was pushed to sit down and rubbed all over.
 The women were naturally happy after not seeing him for a billion years.
 Li Yao blinked and asked, “How long will it take me to succeed?”
 It was really difficult to condense the Supreme
 Rules. She couldn’t see how long it would take.
 Han Jue smiled and said, “I’ll guide you later.” Li Yao was pleasantly surprised. Her gaze seemed to melt him.
 Dao Comprehension Sword asked excitedly, “What about me? What about me?” “You? Stop dreaming,” Han Jue said bluntly, causing her pretty face to collapse.


 Han Jue preached the Dao to the Dao Companions for a long time. Each had different gains, and the one who gained the most was naturally Li Yao. Her Great Dao World had
 Han Jue waved his sleeve and brought them to the Ultimate Origin World.
 The current Ultimate Origin World had changed greatly. Just its size had increased several times in a billion years. More and more Great Dao Sages appeared, and the strongest Life Fiendcelestial had already condensed the first Supreme Rule.
 As the first Fiendcelestial in the Ultimate Origin World and even receiving Han Jue’s guidance, the Life Fiendcelestial’s cultivation was naturally the first in the Ultimate Origin World. Below him, Dugu Wu, Han You, the leader of the Ultimate Origin Soul Race, and the other peerless mighty figures followed closely behind. The difference didn’t increase.
 Han Jue scanned the Ultimate Origin World and estimated that it already had the foundation to fight the entire Endless Era. The number of cultivators in all realms was no less than in the Endless Era.
 As the Creator Lord, his Great Dao World naturally surpassed all the current worlds. It was easier for all living beings to pursue the Great Dao Supreme Realm there than in other Great Dao Worlds.
 The Ultimate Origin World would definitely give birth to a Dao Creator in the future. Han Jue’s ambition was that among the 49 Dao Creators, the Ultimate Origin World would occupy half!
 Only then would the Ultimate Origin World be qualified to replace the blank domain!
 He wanted the pale outside to turn dark red!
 Han Jue and the others appeared in the void and wandered aimlessly.
 The most lively Chang Yue’er began to talk about her understanding of the Ultimate Origin World.
 “Is Dugu Wu your disciple? Hundreds of millions of years ago, he descended into the Endless Era and defeated many powerful enemies to prove his worth. He challenged hundreds of Great Dao Supremes and was extremely arrogant. However, no one below the Dao Creator Realm could subdue him,” Chang Yue’er said excitedly.
 Dugu Wu claimed to be the Lord’s disciple. This
 was the reason why the Dao Creators and the mighty figures who wanted to break through did not dare to teach him a lesson.
 What if it was true?
 Xing Hongxuan smiled. “That temper might
 really be the case. Husband keeps a low profile, but his disciples and sons are each more arrogant than the other. It’s strange.”
 Xuan Qingjun laughed. “Perhaps his teachings made the juniors afraid. Who can enter seclusion with him for millions of years? This
 The women teased him.
 Han Jue smiled and didn’t say anything. He looked at Dugu Wu.
 This fellow was in seclusion. He had already established his Great Dao World. His world was considered powerful in the Ultimate Origin World. The space in the Ultimate Origin World was very abundant, and not all of them were
 on the same plane. Those Great Dao Worlds were hidden in deeper spaces and did not disturb all living beings.
 Dugu Wu’s cultivation was not bad. It was nothing difficult for him to catch up to the Life Fiendcelestial.
 After all, the Life Fiendcelestial was transformed by the Chaotic Fiendcelestial, and
 Han Jue retracted his gaze. He started to enjoy
 a rare period of relaxation.
 He could play with the women for a while
 longer.
 Ten thousand years was like a blink of an eye
 to the current him. Cultivating less than ten
 thousand years was nothing.
 …
 Above the vast Primordial Great Dao World
 stood three connected palaces. They were the Dao Fields of the three Primordial
 Fiendcelestials.
 At this moment, Primordial Origin and Huang
 Zuntian came to visit Han Huang. The three Primordial Fiendcelestials had
 already fused. They were equivalent to clones,
 so everything would be discussed together. “A higher realm?” Han Huang raised his
 eyebrows.
 Primordial Origin said with a burning gaze,
 “That’s right. We have to plan for a higher
 realm. If the Lord can reach it, why can’t we? Although we’ve just stepped into the Dao Creator Realm, do you really think it’s enough?
 the highest, we should plan for the next step.
 We should walk step by step to the strongest position and even surpass the Lord!”
 His words were firm and powerful. He was not
 afraid that Han Huang would think too much. They were already one and would live and die together.
 Han Huang did not refuse but thought seriously.
 a Dao Creator.
 Huang Zuntian said, “Fighting spirit is not important. What’s important is how to realize it. I can sense the Primordial Chaos’ limits. We will at most be stronger than the other Dao
 Creators if we rely on the Primordial Chaos alone.” Primordial Origin said in a low voice, “Of
 course, we have to evolve our bloodline! There must be a higher-level bloodline above the Primordial Fiendcelestial. This is how the Lord succeeded. Only one Primordial Fiendcelestial was allowed in the Chaos before the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity. But what’s the Lord since Han Huang exists? His bloodline can’t be lower than the Primordial Fiendcelestial.” Han Huang and Huang Zuntian were moved.
 The Primordial Fiendcelestial bloodline could evolve? Primordial Origin said, “I’m preparing to reincarnate and travel the Ultimate Origin World. Perhaps I can get an answer there, this matter might offend the Lord. I need you
 but
 to smooth things over with him.” Han Huang said in a low voice, “You have to
 promise not to disturb the Ultimate Origin World.”
 Primordial Origin shook his head and laughed.
 “I wouldn’t dare even if I had ten guts. You don’t have to remind me about this.” Han Huang hesitated for a while before finally
 nodding.
 He felt that he should indeed charge towards a higher realm!
 In the depths of the blank domain, under the
 Endless Divine Tree.
 The Ninth Chaos was playing chess with the Dao Ancestor. This chessboard was a mountain and river. When the pawns landed, they transformed into creation and split the mountains and rivers into two. They deduced the world together. The two worlds constantly devoured each other and played games. The Dao Ancestor said, “There will be more
 Dao Creators in the future, but can there be one more realm above?”
 The Ninth Chaos said indifferently, “You want to know the Lord’s attitude?”
 The Dao Ancestor smiled. “Of course, but the reason why I want to know is that I’m confident. This Lord is different from you. He’s
 different from the Primordial Fiendcelestial of the past. He’s more tolerant.” The Ninth Chaos said, “You’re too anxious. You just became a Dao Creator and want to reach a higher realm. I’ve already failed, so I can’t give you an answer. The only thing I can tell you is that if you want to explore a higher realm, you
 have to wait a little longer. Wait until you’re as
 strong as me.”
 The Dao Ancestor said meaningfully, “Perhaps breaking through to a higher realm is no longer just cultivation. Otherwise, why didn’t you
 succeed?”


 “That’s right. I didn’t succeed, so you probably can’t as well. If you insist on trying, I’ll just wait and see if you succeed,” the Ninth Chaos replied with a calm tone. He was not angered by the Dao Ancestor.
 The Dao Ancestor suddenly waved his hand and placed a piece down. It stirred up a storm and shook the mountains and rivers of the Ninth Chaos. The Ninth Chaos placed a piece down and the piece transformed into a mountain that blocked the storm and dispersed it.
ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels The two Dao Creators continued to fight. The mountains and rivers in front of them
 alternated between destruction and
 …
 Ultimate Origin World, netherworld
 An extremely majestic city stood majestically in the boundless ghost mist. It was like the largest ghost god in the netherworld hiding in the darkness. The figure revealed was enough to scare mortals out of their wits.
 A plaque hung above the city gate. Two words larger than mountains were carved on it. Yama Hall!
 On the first level of Yama Hall.
 Yang Tiandong lay on a chair. He shook a feather fan in his hand. The feathers burned with blue flames and emitted a cold aura.
 “There’s really nothing to look forward to these days.”
 Yang Tiandong suddenly sighed. He had yearned for the Ultimate Origin World in the past, but he felt bored now.
 He controlled the Ultimate Origin World’s netherworld. Any foreign mighty figure who wanted to enter the Ultimate Origin World had to beg him.
 It was not an exaggeration to say that other than his master, he was no longer afraid of anyone.
 Eternal power brought endless emptiness.
 Although he was only a Great Dao Sage, he also had an invincible loneliness.
 When he was bored, Yang Tiandong liked to look back and immerse himself in the adventure.
 A figure descended just as Yang Tiandong was wallowing in boredom.
 It was Primordial Origin.
 Yang Tiandong only glanced at him.
 Primordial Origin said, “I am Primordial Origin. I want to reincarnate into the Ultimate Origin World and see how it looks. My main body will not enter, I will only release a wisp of my will. I specially came to greet you. It can be considered giving the Lord face.”
 Yang Tiandong felt that Primordial Origin’s name was a little familiar. On careful thought, wasn’t it the Primordial Fiendcelestial that had fused with Han Huang, the new Dao Creator?
 Yang Tiandong did not panic at all when facing the new Dao Creator.
 He asked casually, “Since you’re a Dao Creator,
 have you asked the Lord?”
 “How can I see the Lord? Can you?”
 “That means that you’re not fated.”
 Yang Tiandong waved his fan and smiled. He
 knew that his master was in the Dao Field, but who could enter other than the Hidden Sect
 disciples?
 “Didn’t Han Huang go to find the Lord?”
 “Yes, but the Lord is not in the Dao Field. His
 clone said that his main body is in the Ultimate Origin World. I will naturally be able to visit the Lord if I reincarnate.”
 Primordial Origin frowned. This King of Hell in front of him made him very unhappy.
 A mere King of Hell dared to make things difficult for him?
 However, he had to endure considering that the other party was the Lord’s disciple.
 Yang Tiandong thought for a moment and said, “Alright, your main body has to stay in this
 hall.”
 “Mm.”
 Primordial Origin won and walked to a corner of the hall to meditate. He sent a wisp of his will into the Ultimate Origin World to reincarnate.
 Yang Tiandong stopped looking at him and continued to immerse himself in the past.
 Reincarnators appeared in the Yama Hall one after another in the following years. Yang Tiandong arranged them one by one. Ten thousand years later.
 A figure appeared. It was Han Jue.
 Yang Tiandong glanced at him casually. He did
 not care at first, but he suddenly stood up when he saw who the other party was.
 “Ma… Master…” Yang Tiandong said with a trembling voice. Han Jue ignored him. Standing in the corner, Primordial Origin stood
 up, and the two of them disappeared from the
 hall. Yang Tiandong heaved a sigh of relief. He
 nervous when he saw his master. So, after Han Jue left, he felt at ease.
 As for what Han Jue and Primordial Origin wanted to do, he was not interested.
 …
 Above the Ultimate Origin World.
 Han Jue and Primordial Origin looked down.
 “How do you feel?” Han Jue asked. Primordial Origin stared intently and sighed.
 “Perfect. It’s even more perfect than the Primordial Chaos and Chaos.”
 Han Jue smiled.
 Primordial Origin hesitated for a moment and
 asked, “Master, is there a bloodline stronger than the Primordial Fiendcelestial? Or can the Primordial Fiendcelestial bloodline continue to
 evolve?”
 Han Jue smiled. “Your cultivation is endless,
 but your bloodline is naturally not. Do you want to continue evolving? This path is very difficult.”
 “I want to try.”
 “How?”
 Primordial Origin replied truthfully. He was not discouraged. Instead, he was confident.
 Han Jue smiled and said, “Then find it in the
 Ultimate Origin World.”
 With that, he vanished. “An existence that surpasses the Primordial Fiendcelestial will indeed appear in the future.” Han Jue’s voice sounded in Primordial Origin’s ears. Immediately after, a figure appeared in his mind.
 It was the mysterious white-haired man. Primordial Origin narrowed his eyes and noted down this person.
 In other words, this person had the potential to surpass the Primordial Fiendcelestial. Why did the Lord tell him this?
 Was it because of Han Huang? Primordial Origin couldn’t understand and decided to find this person first. He immediately transformed into countless clones and traveled the heavens.
 In the third Dao Field.
 With his reminder, the future began to change.
 In order to evolve, Primordial Origin became possessed. At first, he didn’t believe Han Jue very much, but he couldn’t evolve even after countless years. Therefore, he recalled the white-haired man Han Jue mentioned. In the end, the white-haired man even became
 his mental demon, causing him to start a war between Dao Creators in the Endless Era.
 As for the white-haired man, he never appeared.
 The reason why Han Jue did this was that he wanted another person to think about the white-haired man. This way, the white-haired
 man wouldn’t suddenly grow up when he wasn’t paying attention.
 fellow would sooner or later place his thoughts on the powerful bloodlines of the Ultimate Origin World and even target him. Primordial Origin would not despair if he was given an illusory goal.
 Han Jue muttered to himself softly, “I can give
 up my position to the three of you when I evolve the Ultimate Origin Fiendcelestial bloodline. However, how long can you last? Don’t disappoint me.”
 He tolerated Primordial Origin because of Han
 Huang. The three Primordial Fiendcelestials were
 already living the same life. Even if Han Jue had a way to separate them, it would cause irreversible damage to Han Huang and he would never improve in the future.
 Han Jue could allow other Creators to appear, but it would be best if they were his children.
 Before that, he had to surpass the Creator Lord Realm.
 Then, Han Jue closed his eyes and prepared to continue cultivating.
 Time passed quickly. Another billion years passed.
 Han Jue was already 5.4 billion years old.
 He opened his eyes and looked at the blank domain first. Something big had happened in the Endless Era, something that affected all living beings.


reputation spread widely, not the least inferior to the Primordial Chaos.
All living beings knew that the Chaos would grow into a colossus. It was unstoppable. Thus, the various factions befriended it.
However, at this moment, danger arrived at the Chaos.
The bloodline that the Dao Heavenly Race had sacrificed the entire race to protect had actually grown into a Great Dao Supreme and begun to wreak havoc in the Chaos.
The Dao Ancestor and Pangu still felt a little guilty towards the Dao Heavenly Race, so they did not interfere, causing all the living beings in the Chaos to fall into uneasiness.
The person who inherited the Dao Heavenly Race’s providence was called Dao Heaven. Originally, this was not his name. But he changed his name to Dao Heaven after awakening his memories. Dao Heaven was his
true name now.
Dao Heaven was not alone. He had acknowledged three masters.
Dao Sovereign, Zhao Xuanyuan, and Jiang Yi were still famous in the Endless Era. After all, they were mighty figures who had survived the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity and were also creating their Great Dao Worlds.
With their support, the mighty figures who wanted to please the Dao Ancestor did not dare to attack. This caused Dao Heaven to be like a fish in water.
This matter attracted the attention of the entire Endless Era.
Especially after knowing Dao Heaven’s
background, this matter became even more dramatic.
Han Jue was also interested and started to pay attention to Dao Heaven.
Dao Sovereign and the other two supported Dao Heaven purely for revenge. They wanted to take revenge on Laozi for fusing with Lao Dan. Laozi was also the Dao Ancestor’s eldest
disciple. After the Dao Ancestor appeared, the master and disciple became very close.
Laozi also focused on dodging them.
Han Jue retracted his gaze after watching for a while.
He was really envious of the Dao Ancestor.
He still had enemies.
Han Jue already felt the loneliness of
invincibility. That so-called white-haired man was also in the distant future. Other than
cultivating, there were very few things that interested him now.
He even had ill intentions. Should he let the Endless Era be in chaos just to tease him?
Forget it, the Endless Era was not powerful enough. He could give the Endless Era a calamity when more Dao Creators appeared.
At Han Jue’s cultivation level, all living beings were meaningless in his eyes. He only did things based on his heart.
Han Jue looked at the others.
Mainly his grandson, Han Liang, and Chu
Xiaoqi.
Han Liang’s cultivation level kept increasing with the two Dao Creators’ help. Chu Xiaoqi was also not bad with the Primordial Chaos’ help. It was equivalent to having the support of three Dao Creators.
In their generation, basically no one was more outstanding than them. Furthermore, they were all highly regarded by the Dao Creators.
He closed his eyes again and continued cultivating.
…
In the void.
A black-robed man was advancing. He was burly and had an ancient face. His blood-colored hair fluttered wantonly like flames.
He was Dao Heaven, the Dao Heavenly Race’s
last bloodline.
He advanced very quickly and leaped through
the void to arrive at a lonely continent. The terrain of this continent was flat, barren, and
lonely.ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels
In the center of the continent, three figures meditated facing each other. Three terrifying auras fused together, causing the nearby space to fluctuate as if it would be destroyed at any
moment.
Dao Heaven landed behind the three of them
and knelt down.
Zhao Xuanyuan asked without opening his eyes, “Why are you here?”
Dao Heaven said, “I don’t want revenge anymore.”
Zhao Xuanyuan was silent.
Dao Sovereign and Jiang Yi did not speak and
continued cultivating.
Dao Heaven took a deep breath and said, “I
went to the Chaos and suddenly understood why the Dao Heavenly Race disappeared. They restricted the development of the Chaos and the Dao Ancestor had no choice but to take
action. The fact that the Dao Ancestor could
keep me is already the greatest kindness to the Dao Heavenly Race.”
Zhao Xuanyuan smiled. “It’s good that you’ve thought it through. However, we’ve put so much pressure on you. Where will our reputation go if you suddenly stop?” Dao Heaven was moved. He kowtowed to the
ground and did not look up.
Jiang Yi added, “So be it if you don’t want
revenge anymore. What are you going to do
next?”
Zhao Xuanyuan was only joking. Actually, they were also open-minded about Lao Dan, but if they could disgust the Dao Ancestor and Laozi, they were still willing.
Now, their conflict with Laozi and the Dao
Ancestor was only a small fight. Both sides did
not take it seriously, but Dao Heaven felt heavy
pressure.
Dao Heaven said in a low voice, “Masters, please punish me. I no longer dare to expect anything!”
He had wreaked havoc in the Chaos for millions
of years. At first, he was very happy, but he got tired of it as time passed. He began to investigate the past. After understanding the truth, he was confused again.
His duty was to take revenge. What should he do now that he was not taking revenge? He didn’t want to do anything else now. At
least, he wanted to obtain the forgiveness of his three masters. He knew very well the reason he could act recklessly. Other than the Dao Ancestor’s benevolence, he also used the influence of his three masters. Otherwise, those mighty figures who wanted to please the Dao Ancestor could crush him at any time. Zhao Xuanyuan said strangely, “Punish? How? I asked you to apologize to the Dao Ancestor and say that it’s all your obsession and has nothing to do with us?”
Dao Heaven was silent. Although he did not
want revenge, he did not like the Dao Ancestor
either. No matter what, the Dao Ancestor had indeed caused the Dao Heavenly Race’s destruction. At most, he would no longer interact with him.
Dao Sovereign opened his eyes and said, “Alright, stop teasing him.”
He looked at Dao Heaven and continued, “It’s best if you understand. Actually, it’s impossible for you to take revenge. After all, the Dao Ancestor is a Dao Creator. The three of us are
not his match even if we join forces. We don’t expect you to do anything for us. We took you
in as a disciple because we admire your courage and unyielding backbone.”
Dao Heaven looked up at him. This First Master
was the strictest in the past. He did not expect him to be the most tolerant now. Zhao Xuanyuan smiled. “Let’s cultivate here
for now. I think it’s unreliable to ask him to catch up to Chu Xiaoqi and Han Liang.” Jiang Yi opened his eyes and said, “Try. Even if
he fails, he has at least grown.’ Chu Xiaoqi and Han Liang? Dao Heaven felt that these two names were
familiar. He thought about it carefully and was immediately moved.
to
“Those two are already breaking through to the Dao Creator Realm. Can I still catch up them?” Dao Heaven asked with a trembling
voice.
Zhao Xuanyuan smiled. “By the way, you still don’t know our identities?” Dao Heaven looked at them and said, “I indeed
don’t know. Could it be that you are also Dao Creators?”
Zhao Xuanyuan’s face twitched. He suddenly wanted to cripple his disciple. Jiang Yi said, “We’re all from the Hidden Sect.
Han Liang and Chu Xiaoqi are equivalent to our junior disciples.”
Dao Heaven was enlightened and looked at his
three masters with admiration. Hidden Sect.
To be able to be the elder of Han Liang and Chu
Xiaoqi was definitely an eternal legend!


Zhao Xuanyuan was even more pleased upon seeing Dao Heaven’s shocked expression. He took over Jiang Yi’s words and began to brag about their glory back then.
That was an era when the Dao Creator did not show himself. Zhao Xuanyuan’s tone was excited, and Dao Heaven’s blood boiled.
Jiang Yi nodded. He had the bearing of Han Jue’s storytelling back then.
As they chatted, Jiang Yi talked about the story that the Lord had told him. This kid Dao
Heaven did not believe him.
He could still believe other things, but not this.
You asked the Lord to tell you a story?
Who are you?
Aren’t you with the Lord’s disciples? You’re even Dao Sovereign’s lackey!
Dao Heaven did not believe it, but he did not dare to say it. He had to give his master face.
Zhao Xuanyuan and Jiang Yi became more and more excited. They even pulled Dao Sovereign along to brag.
“Hmph, what’s there to say? Back then, I helped him when my master, the Lord, awakened his Chaotic Physique. It’s nothing. We’re both master and disciple and good friends,” Dao Sovereign said coldly, making Dao Heaven worship him even more.
First Master was still the best. He spoke sincerely and convincingly.
Just like that, Dao Heaven stayed beside Dao Sovereign and the other two and prepared to cultivate in seclusion.
The noisy Endless Era quietened down again.
However, this silence did not last long.
Time passed.
Another ten million years had passed when Han Jue opened his eyes again.
this action allowed him to relax.
In the last billion years, the Ultimate Origin World’s growth far exceeded the previous years together. Such an extreme and exaggerated expansion also caused fear to spread in the Endless Era.
A mighty figure suggested a possibility. Would the Ultimate Origin World devour other Great Dao Worlds like the Chaos in the past?
This possibility caused an uproar.
Even if it was only a possibility, what if it was
true?
Those Great Dao Supremes who had created Great Dao Worlds were the most terrified. Facing a Lord, they had no chance of winning.
Han Jue didn’t care what all living beings thought because their guess was right.
He wouldn’t mind even if all living beings became his enemies. He even looked forward to
it and treated it as an activity.
His benevolence to all living beings was that the Ultimate Origin World would leave a place for them in the future.
The Ultimate Origin World was unstoppable!
Han Jue was finally walking the Ninth Chaos’ path, but he had never doubted it. This was also the reason why he let him survive.
Han Jue’s benevolence could give the enemy a way out. The Ninth Chaos just couldn’t kill the other Dao Creators.
The experts enslaved by him were all living well. Han Jue didn’t deliberately suppress
them.
The previous four Dao Creators couldn’t even cultivate and had to help the Ninth Chaos
supervise his Chaos.
The Chaotic Consciousness watched as his
Great Dao World was suppressed by the Chaos
These matters were actually not important to
them.
Han Jue would always only believe in himself.
This was also the thought of all the mighty figures. The only difference was who was stronger.
As expected, his children and disciples had
Han Jue let them in as he checked his emails.
Han Tuo, Han Huang, Han Ling, Han Yunjin, Dao Sovereign, Li Daokong, Murong Qi, and so on, nearly twenty people, came in at once.
Han Jue was calm.CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m
Everyone looked at each other. Han Huang took
a deep breath and asked, “Father, will the Ultimate Origin World devour other Great Dao
Worlds?”
Han Jue said, “If it’s big enough, it will.” Everyone’s expressions changed.
Han Yunjin was the most relaxed because he
did not develop a Great Dao World. He only came to join in the fun.
Dao Sovereign hurriedly asked, “Then what should our Great Dao Worlds do?”
themselves.
“You can open your Great Dao World again
after the Ultimate Origin World devours them.
As for your living beings, nothing will happen to them. They will only be assimilated,” Han Jue replied with a smile, as if he was talking about an unimportant matter. Everyone was anxious. They had finally
reached this point, and he wanted them to cultivate the Great Dao World again? Han Huang asked, “Will my cultivation realm
decrease if my Primordial Chaos is fused with the Ultimate Origin World?”
“No, but you will have to create the Primordial
It was the truth.
Murong Qi said, “Can I take the initiative to
fuse in advance? In that case, it can save time.”
Not everyone had the courage to overturn the past billions of years. Han Tuo couldn’t help but ask, “Father, why

Han Jue said, “Yes, I also want to cultivate. The only thing I can promise you is that I will definitely surpass my current realm. No one can stop me.”
Everyone was silent.
After a long while… They left the third Dao Field. Han Jue didn’t care about them. They could try
to oppose him. It was a good opportunity to show the Creator Lord’s might. There was no harm in doing so as long as they
trusted that Han Jue could still surpass the Creator Lord Realm and join the Ultimate Origin World. Of course, if they didn’t believe it, from their point of view, Han Jue’s actions would indeed destroy their future.
