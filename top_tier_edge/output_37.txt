 The world was vast and dark clouds surged as if a dragon was churning it.
 In the mountains, there was a vast valley. The huge peaks in all directions were like fingers with their palms facing the sky.
 In the valley.
 Dao Sovereign, Zhao Xuanyuan, and Jiang Yi stood side by side as they looked at a huge cauldron in the distance. Green smoke curled up as the elder in the raincoat stood on the back of the water buffalo and looked down into the cauldron.
 The elder in the raincoat placed his left hand behind his waist and stroked his beard with his right hand. He frowned.
 Zhao Xuanyuan muttered, “The situation doesn’t seem optimistic.”
 Jiang Yi said with a worried expression, “What if we fail? If we knew earlier, we should have left after obtaining the Supreme Treasure. We shouldn’t have listened to this old Daoist. Now, we’re trapped in this world by the Great Dao Divine Spirit. We’ll all die once we can’t refine the Primordial Pill.”
  Dao Sovereign frowned and looked at the elder in the raincoat with resentment.
 The elder in the raincoat heard their conversation and said angrily, “You three brats! Stop gossiping behind my back! When have I ever lied to you? It’s just that the Primordial Pill is damaged. After all, countless years have passed. This is normal.”
 Zhao Xuanyuan rolled his eyes. He wanted to retort, but Dao Sovereign stopped him.
 “Don’t disturb him, lest something really happens.”
 Dao Sovereign pulled Zhao Xuanyuan and Jiang Yi into the forest to meditate.
 After the three of them left, the old man frowned again.
 “What’s going on… It doesn’t make sense! Why can’t the Primordial Pill take form?”
 The elder in the raincoat thought of a possibility and trembled.
 Impossible!
 Absolutely impossible!
 If the Primordial Fiendcelestial had already been born and was not discovered, how terrifying would that be?
 A terrifying existence with immeasurable potential had been secretly growing. Wouldn’t the entire Chaos be slaughtered when he appeared?
 The elder in the raincoat shifted his gaze back to the cauldron. A purple pill floated above the rolling flames and spun on its own. Its surface was covered in cracks.
 “No, if this continues, that fellow will definitely kill us if we can’t refine the pill.”
 The old man’s eyes turned ruthless. He suddenly turned to look at Dao Sovereign and the other two.
 The old man in the raincoat used a voice transmission to explain, afraid that the Great Dao Divine Spirit outside the world would hear him.
 Dao Sovereign and the other two’s expressions changed.
 They did not curse. Instead, they sent a voice transmission to scold the elder. Those vulgar words entered the elder’s ears, causing him to be furious. He couldn’t show it on his face.
 “The reason why I’m not consuming it is that I want to maintain my rationality and use my spatial and time Mystical Power to avoid the pursuit of the Great Dao Divine Spirit. Do you still want to live?”
 “That’s right! I’ll show you my cards! This pill can’t be repaired. Everyone will die once it’s discovered!”
 Facing such a scoundrel, Zhao Xuanyuan almost wanted to attack.
 Dao Sovereign took a deep breath and was about to take a step forward, but Jiang Yi left first, leaving only one sentence for the two of them, “Let me go. I just want to recall the invincible me from the past. Unfortunately, Sect Master can’t see my glory.
 “I really want him to tell me another story.”
 Dao Sovereign frowned and could only sigh.
 Zhao Xuanyuan gritted his teeth and wanted to stop him, but he had no choice.
 Jiang Yi came to the cauldron and jumped up, standing on it.
 The elder did not say anything else. He waved his sleeve and sent the Primordial Pill to his mouth. Jiang Yi opened his mouth and swallowed it.
 Whoosh
 Jiang Yi’s body suddenly burned with True Sun Flame. A pair of fire wings spread out from his back and wrapped around the old man and the cauldron.
 Immediately after, the elder in the raincoat jumped out and frantically patted the True Sun Flame on his body.
 “Little beast!”
 The elder cursed silently, but he did not dare to say it, afraid that he would be discovered by the Great Dao Divine Spirit.
 However, the Great Dao Divine Spirit was not so easily fooled.
 “What are you doing!” a thunderous shout shook the entire world.
 Jiang Yi suddenly transformed into a huge three-legged Golden Crow and roared into the sky, as if he was shouting.
 He dared to challenge the Great Dao Divine Spirit!
 “Eh? What aura is this?
  “How dare you! How dare you take the Primordial Pill without permission!”
 The Great Dao Divine Spirit was first surprised, then became furious.
 The rolling thunderclouds suddenly exploded. A terrifying, huge hand descended and grabbed at Jiang Yi.
 With the anger of the gods, the world changed color.
 …
 Inside the Daoist temple.
 Han Jue had just entered seclusion for ten thousand years when he opened his eyes.
 He was already 1.2 million years old!
 Recently, he had been feeling inexplicably uneasy, causing him to be unable to cultivate in peace. Therefore, his seclusion ended after ten thousand years.
 He observed the Hundred Peak Immortal River. No one was about to leave like the Fusang Tree.
 He immediately came to her Daoist temple and asked, “What’s wrong?”
 He checked Xing Hongxuan’s body and found nothing unusual.
 The fetus was fine, only trembling slightly.
 Xing Hongxuan opened her eyes and said with lingering fear, “Husband, I started dreaming for some reason. I dreamed that our son kept crying and that something around him seemed to want to hurt him.”
 Han Jue frowned and started to deduce.
 Soon, he locked onto Jiang Yi.
 He could sense a very dangerous aura from Jiang Yi, making him see him as his natural enemy.
 He immediately checked his emails and discovered Jiang Yi’s situation.
 (Your good friend Jiang Yi has obtained the power of the Primordial Fiendcelestial. He has lost his mind and his cultivation has increased greatly.]
 The power of the Primordial Fiendcelestial?
 He checked Jiang Yi’s profile picture and saw that he did not transform into a Primordial Fiendcelestial.
 He had no choice but to use the derivation function. He deducted 500 billion years of his lifespan and entered the illusion.
 Not long after, he opened his eyes.
 “Primordial Pill… There’s actually such a divine item in the world?”
 Han Jue frowned and continued to ask in his mind, “How was this Primordial Pill born?”
 [1 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 The value of a Dao Creator!
 Continue!
 [Primordial Pill: Before the Chaos, the Primordial Fiendcelestial’s Dao Fruit transformed. Because the Chaos replaced the Primordial Chaos, the Primordial Fiendcelestial died. The Dao Fruit carried a chance of survival and transformed into the Primordial Pill. Because of the current existence of the Primordial Fiendcelestial in the Chaos, the Primordial Pill lost its effect. Only the remnant power of the main body remains.]
 The Primordial Fiendcelestial before the Chaos…
 Han Jue’s expression darkened.
 Crap!
 Jiang Yi’s actions would definitely attract the attention of those terrifying existences!
 He would be doomed if he was labeled as a Primordial Fiendcelestial!
 Han Jue hesitated to save Jiang Yi.
 He suddenly thought of something.
 Jiang Yi had already lost his mind…
  “Am I Jiang Yi’s match now?”
 (500 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [Not for the time being. Jiang Yi has already been possessed by the Primordial Fiendcelestial. He will directly die after the short-term possession effect ends.]
 He would die…
 What were these three unlucky fellows doing?!
 Who was that old Daoist riding a cow?
 Han Jue continued to use the derivation function.


 “I want to know who the old Daoist who made Jiang Yi take the Primordial Pill is?”
 (300 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 A line of words appeared in front of Han Jue.
 (Lao Dan: Early-stage Great Dao Supreme Realm, Laozi’s Dharma Idol, Immeasurable Emperor, Sword Dao Sword Spirit]
 Laozi’s Dharma idol?
 Han Jue frowned. What did he want?
  Trying to scheme against him?
 With Lao Dan’s cultivation, it was impossible for him to not deduce the relationship between Dao Sovereign and the other two. It was impossible for him to not know Han Jue with Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du around.
 In an instant, killing intent burst out of Han Jue’s eyes.
 The most important thing now was to save Jiang Yi.
 It was impossible to go personally. It was too dangerous.
 Han Jue could only think of a way to save Jiang Yi as far as possible.
 He looked into the distance.
 Especially Jiang Yi!
 How violent!
 Even Han Jue was shocked.
 There was a mighty figure outside the restriction. He was probably also an existence with the Great Dao. His aura was powerful, and Han Jue couldn’t see through him.
 The terrifying True Sun Flame suddenly broke through the restriction and drowned the supreme existences. Flames burned space, and layers of space shattered until the Primordial Void appeared.
 Han Jue finally saw Jiang Yi.
 He had already transformed into a flaming man. He had a human figure and a Golden Crow head. He had a pair of fire wings on his back and his height was immeasurable. Even supreme existences seemed tiny in front of him.
 Jiang Yi roared angrily. The endless True Sun Flame swept in all directions. Even Han Jue, who was in the Heavenly Dao, felt his eyes burn.
 How scorching was this?
 Han Jue was secretly shocked. How strong was the Primordial Fiendcelestial before the Chaos?
 Why did he die since he was so strong?
 For a time, Han Jue was confused and even a little sad.
 Facing the crazy Jiang Yi, the supreme existences could not stop him at all.
 Jiang Yi rushed in a direction fearlessly. The True Sun Flame burned everything along the way. The stars and space turned into nothingness.
 Lao Dan brought Dao Sovereign and Zhao Xuanyuan away and entered the spatial turbulence.
 Zhao Xuanyuan asked anxiously, “Where’s Jiang Yi? Did you ignore him?”
 Lao Dan cursed, “How? We were lucky not to be burned to death just now! Damn it, I didn’t expect the effect of the Primordial Pill to be so domineering!”
 He was filled with fear.
 How terrifying was the true Primordial Fiendcelestial?
 The thought of being targeted by the Primordial Fiendcelestial made Lao Dan shiver in fear.
 Dao Sovereign gritted his teeth and asked, “What will happen to him after that? Will he die?”
 Dao Sovereign did not dare to imagine.
 Lao Dan was silent.
 Dao Sovereign said angrily, “Let us go back. I’ll just die with him!”
 Zhao Xuanyuan also expressed his standing. “Old thing! You harmed us brothers. You will die a horrible death. Hurry up and let us back!”
 Lao Dan looked at them in disbelief. “Are you crazy? You’ll only die for nothing if you go back!”
 “The three of us will live and die together!” Dao Sovereign said firmly, causing Lao Dan to fall silent.
 Zhao Xuanyuan urged, “Don’t pretend to be dead!”
 The two of them were wrapped in Lao Dan’s Dharmic powers and could not move. Otherwise, they would have long flown out.
 Lao Dan gritted her teeth. “I’m really unlucky to have the three of you! Forget it, I’ll risk my life to save that kid!”
 He began to form hand seals. His surging Dharmic powers stirred his raincoat, and a door of light appeared in front of him. Immediately after, a figure slowly walked out.
 This person looked identical to Lao Dan, but he wore a Daoist robe. His temperament was extraordinary and his expression was indifferent as if he had no emotions.
 Lao Dan looked embarrassed and said shamelessly, “Help me save someone. It’s behind. You should be able to feel it.”
 The other party was his true body, Laozi!
 Laozi asked expressionlessly, “Is it because of
 you?”
 Lao Dan coughed and nodded awkwardly.
 Laozi vanished without another word.
 Lao Dan heaved a sigh of relief.
 Zhao Xuanyuan asked curiously, “Who was that just now? Your brother?”
 Lao Dan snorted. “We are the same person, like the main body and a clone.” “You’re the clone?”
 “How is that possible! Of course, he’s the clone! Don’t worry, your brother’s life will be saved with him around!”
 “The main body is not as strong as the clone? Can you brag better?”
 “Brat, do you want to anger me to death?”
 Zhao Xuanyuan fell silent.
Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n)) The atmosphere instantly fell silent.
 Dao Sovereign and Zhao Xuanyuan were both worried about Jiang Yi.
 Lao Dan was also very embarrassed to see them so dejected.
 On the other side.
 Han Jue suddenly saw a powerful aura approaching the battlefield, directly isolating his gaze and preventing him from spying on the battlefield.
 What was that?
 Han Jue immediately checked the emails. There was indeed something.
 [Your good friend Jiang Yi was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure and was severely injured.)
 [Your good friend Jiang Yi’s soul has been squeezed dry and is about to die.]
 (Your good friend Jiang Yi was saved by a mysterious mighty figure. His remnant soul was protected.]
 He was saved?
 Who was this mysterious mighty figure?
 Han Jue immediately deduced.
 (900 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 So high…
 Continue!
 A line of words appeared in front of him.
 [Laozi: Perfected Great Dao Supreme Realm, Transcendent Dao Expert, Pangu Essence Soul, personal disciple of the Dao Ancestor, creator of the Sword Dao, ancestor of the Hundred Schools, Immeasurable Emperor, ancestor of the Human School, founder of the Great Dao]
 How… impressive!
 Han Jue was shocked. He had guessed that Laozi might be very strong, but he didn’t expect him to be so strong.
 This was even stronger than the previous Holy Mother of Order!
 No wonder Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du was confident in resisting the entire Deity Realm of the Ruins of End. He had such a powerful backing
 Han Jue was originally very dissatisfied with Laozi and thought that he was plotting against him. Now that Laozi had saved Jiang Yi, this dissatisfaction vanished like smoke.
 “Will Jiang Yi be thought of as the Primordial Fiendcelestial after this battle?”
 Han Jue frowned and fell into worry.
 Laozi definitely knew that Jiang Yi was not the Primordial Fiendcelestial, but could he protect him?
 Soon, the battlefield ended. He looked over and didn’t see Laozi or the supreme existences anymore.
 Han Jue’s uneasiness dissipated.
 The power of the Primordial Fiendcelestial had already vanished.
 At this moment, Xing Hongxuan said, “Husband, my son is quiet again.”
  Just now, Han Jue stood beside her and stared in one direction with a serious expression. She didn’t dare to disturb him.
 Han Jue came back to his senses and said, “Yes, it’s over. Don’t tell anyone about this. Just pretend that nothing happened.”
 Xing Hongxuan nodded. She did not ask why.
 She wasn’t stupid. Her son had been nurtured for so many years and had yet to be born. He was definitely extraordinary and might attract many disasters.
 He opened the emails and checked. He did not see any updates on Jiang Yi and the other two, so he could only give up.
 Forget it.
 Continue cultivating!


 Another ten thousand years passed.
 Ten thousand years was a long time for mortals, an unattainable promise to stay together to people in love, and a day to those who attained the Dao.
 Han Jue opened his eyes. During this period of time, he didn’t receive Laozi’s dream. He didn’t know what Laozi’s attitude was towards Jiang Yi. He started checking his emails.
 [Your son Han Tuo was attacked by a mysterious ghost) x103932
 (Your good friend Yi Tian was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure and was severely injured.)
 [Your good friend Jiang Yi has reconstructed his body and cultivated the Divine Yang Indestructible Body.]
 (Your disciple Dao Sovereign has entered the Primordial World’s illusion.]
  (Your disciple Zhao Xuanyuan has entered the Primordial World’s illusion.]
 (Your grand-disciple Chu Shiren has more than a hundred million believers. His providence has increased.]
 (Your good friend Divine Lord Peacock was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure and was severely injured.)
 Jiang Yi had indeed benefited from a disaster!
 Han Jue liked Laozi more. He was different from the other Great Dao Sages. He seemed to really have no desires.
 Perhaps it was precisely because of this that Laozi could shake off the Great Dao Sages in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End and focus on seeking the Dao, constantly surpassing the
 peak.
 Han Jue continued reading. The other disciples had their own opportunities in the past ten thousand years and were all doing well.
 He still acknowledged this fellow. If not for him pestering the Curse Fiendcelestial for hundreds of thousands of years, it wouldn’t have died so easily.
 Han Jue thought for a moment and decided to care about Divine Lord Peacock.
 He began to send a dream to him, appearing as the Dark Forbidden Lord.
 The dream was a beautiful starry sky. The galaxy was magnificent and the light was layered.
 Divine Lord Peacock opened his eyes and was pleasantly surprised to see Han Jue.
 “Forbidden Lord, you’ve finally appeared!” Divine Lord Peacock said excitedly and went in front of him.
 “The Curse Fiendcelestial has disappeared for some reason. I can’t find him,” Divine Lord Peacock said gloomily.
 Han Jue said, “The Curse Fiendcelestial is already dead.”
 “Dead?”
 Divine Lord Peacock was stunned. He had been entangled with the Curse Fiendcelestial for so long and knew how powerful it was. This fellow might have average Dharmic powers, but his escape ability was still very strong.
 Could it be…
 The Dark Forbidden Lord had personally taken action?
 Divine Lord Peacock was in awe.
 Han Jue didn’t explain further and asked, “Who injured you recently?”
 Furious, Divine Lord Peacock immediately cursed, “It’s all because of that fellow. His name is Divine Lord Xin Yu, a Great Dao Sage. He joined the Life Faction and was extremely arrogant. He insisted that I submit to him. I’m still being suppressed by him.”
 Divine Lord Xin Yu…
 Han Jue had never heard of him. He would use the derivation function to ask later. “Forbidden Lord, since you’re here, it means that you want to save me. Hurry up and attack. This fellow tortures me every day. I really can’t stand it,” Divine Lord Peacock said helplessly.
 If he did not encounter a Great Dao Sage, he would be an existence in the Chaos.
 However, he was facing problems because of his potential.
 Great Dao Sages often targeted him, wanting to subdue him.
 His situation was the most difficult among the Freedom Sages.
 As long as he had the backing of a Great Dao Sage, Divine Lord Peacock could attain the Great Dao at any time. However, this fellow was stubborn and refused to bow his head.
 Han Jue asked, “Did you learn anything about Life from Divine Lord Xin Yu?”
 Divine Lord Peacock thought for a moment and said, “He mentioned the Devil Ancestor before. He said that there are two geniuses under him who are from the Heavenly Dao. They both have talent that isn’t inferior to mine and will join Life sooner or later. If I don’t surrender, he will snatch my Dao Fruit and give it to those two geniuses to help them obtain stronger potential.
 “What nonsense. No one’s talent can surpass mine, not even a Chaotic Fiendcelestial!”
 Divine Lord Peacock was full of conceit.
 Han Jue remained silent.
 Although Divine Lord Peacock was powerful, to be honest, Han Jue didn’t think that he was really the most talented.
 However, Divine Lord Xin Yu actually targeted Han Tuo and Yi Tian.
 This was not good!
 Han Jue said, “Show me this Divine Lord Xin Yu’s appearance. I’ll help you resolve this problem.”
 Divine Lord Peacock was waiting for him to say this. He raised his hand and waved, and a figure appeared beside him.
 Han Jue noted it down silently and removed the dream.
 He opened his eyes and asked in his mind, “Can I insta-kill Divine Lord Xin Yu?”
 (150 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 This value…
 Han Jue suddenly didn’t want to ask anymore.
 Forget it.
 Remain steady.
 Continue!
 (Yes]
 Han Jue was bored. He had wasted 150 billion years of his lifespan.
 With this value, he would definitely be insta-killed.
 What am I worried about?
 No!
 I should be worried!
 Being cautious was the right thing to do. This was one of the reasons why he could live until today. How could he despise his own caution?
 Han Jue’s eyes became firm and flashed with killing intent.
 The Dark Forbidden Zone had never been used since its creation.
 It was time to show off!
 Han Jue directly sent a dream to Divine Lord Xin Yu. It was still the image of the Dark Forbidden Lord.
 Divine Lord Xin Yu wore a dark purple robe and a curtained pearl crown. At first glance, he looked like an emperor.
 Divine Lord Xin Yu stared at him and frowned. “Who are you?”
 He was actually pulled into a dream. Before he entered the dream, he was still refining pills and was not distracted.
 Han Jue said, “Let Divine Lord Peacock go. Perhaps I can give you a way out.”
 Divine Lord Xin Yu immediately laughed wildly when he heard that. “I didn’t expect Divine Lord Peacock to have someone backing him? However, he’s already my pet. Stop dreaming!”
 He wanted to jump out of the dream, but he realized that he could not.
 It seemed that the other party was stronger than him!
 However, it was useless. It was only a dream.
 Could this guy kill him in his dreams?
 Divine Lord Xin Yu smiled. “That’s right! It’s fine if you want to join Life. Life is stronger than you can imagine. The Chaos will definitely be dominated by Life in the future. Life will create darkness and create the final meaning of existence!”
 This guy was crazy.
 Han Jue couldn’t be bothered to chat with him anymore and directly used the Dark Forbidden Zone.
 In an instant, the entire dreamscape twisted violently. Darkness drowned them.
 Han Jue took out the Heaven-Opening Axe and appeared in front of him.
 Divine Lord Xin Yu subconsciously waved his sleeve, and his robe emitted divine light to resist the Heaven-Opening Axe.
  Boom
 With a swing of the axe, his robe shattered and Divine Lord Xin Yu was cut into two.
 The violent Dharmic powers destroyed his body and soul!
 This Great Dao Sage couldn’t block Han Jue’s full-powered attack at all!
 Han Jue waved his axe again.
 Inside the Daoist temple.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and sighed slightly.
 “Being invincible is really lonely. Another insta-kill. There’s no experience to speak of,” Han Jue muttered to himself. At his realm, a second was actually very long. It was enough for him to swing the Heaven-Opening Axe billions of times!


 Han Jue sent a dream to Divine Lord Peacock after killing Divine Lord Xin Yu.
 “So fast?”
 Divine Lord Peacock was stunned. How long had it been since the last dream?
 Could it be that the Dark Forbidden Lord had been following him and secretly protecting him?
 Impossible!
 Or…
 Divine Lord Peacock looked at the Dark Forbidden Lord with reverence.
  Han Jue said, “Find a place to cultivate after you leave. I’ll inform you at any time if I need you in the future.”
 With that, Han Jue directly removed the dream.
 Divine Lord Peacock opened his eyes.
 He was imprisoned in a furnace. The space inside was extremely vast, like a world of flames.
 He looked up at the sky. Five-colored divine light shot out from his back and pierced through the sky, causing white light to shoot down from the entrance.
 Divine Lord Peacock jumped out and appeared in a hall.
 The hall was silent. Other than him, no other living beings could be seen.
 Divine Lord Peacock observed his surroundings warily but did not detect Divine Lord Xin Yu’s aura.
 Divine Lord Xin Yu shouldn’t have fled. If he did, the power of the Dharma treasure would still be there. Only if he died would the restrictions of this cauldron weaken. Thus, Divine Lord Peacock could escape on his own.
 Divine Lord Peacock scanned the hall disdainfully. Then, he put away the cauldron that had suppressed him and left.
 Divine Lord Xin Yu also had a world under him. There was no lack of Sages. Divine Lord Peacock was filled with anger and needed to vent, so he slaughtered this world.
 Several hours later.
 Divine Lord Peacock appeared in the Dark Forbidden Zone. He snorted. “If you want to blame someone, blame yourselves for being born in the wrong place!” He transformed into a five-colored divine light and vanished into the darkness.
 Buzhou Divine Mountain.
 Han Yu was meditating under the old tree when he suddenly opened his eyes and saw Qin Ling floating in front of him.
 Qin Ling wore divine armor and held a divine weapon. He flew with divine might and was more imposing than the immortals Han Yu had seen.
 Their eyes met and they smiled.
 Qin Ling landed and knelt in front of him and said firmly, “Unfilial grand-disciple Qin Ling has returned to visit Grandmaster!”
 He kowtowed.
 The woman in green in the distance was alarmed and opened her eyes to see this scene.
 She was secretly shocked.
 Qin Ling was not simple at a glance. Other than Han Jue, she had never seen anyone with a stronger bearing than Qin Ling.
 Even Han Yu seemed weak in front of him!
 Qin Ling noticed the woman in green and asked, “She is?”
 Han Yu smiled. “Cultivators on the mountain. Don’t worry about her. Tell me why you’re back. How have you been for the past hundreds of thousands of years?”
 “Sure.”
 Qin Ling agreed readily. He was also very excited to see Han Yu again.
 The woman in green was secretly shocked.
 Hundreds of thousands of years…
 If even his grand-disciple was like this, how long had this senior lived?
 Qin Ling began to talk from the moment he went to the Chaos. Soon, the woman in green listened carefully.
 Several days later.
 Qin Ling had just finished speaking when Han Yu sighed. He didn’t expect Qin Ling to live such an exciting life all these years.
 The woman in green looked at Qin Ling with admiration. If it were her, she would have given up long ago. She suddenly felt that the hatred she carried was nothing
 After so many years, his master had probably already reincarnated. He might have already reincarnated as a prodigy. Qin Ling looked at the woman in green and hesitated.
 Han Yu immediately told her to go down the mountain.
Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m The woman in green curled her lips and immediately went down the mountain.
 Then, Qin Ling explained the reason for his return.
 Qin Ling said calmly, “Grandmaster Zhou Fan told me that with the approval of the Divine Might Heavenly Sage, nothing will go wrong. The Sages won’t dare to scheme against me.”
 At the mention of Han Jue, the worry on Han Yu’s face immediately disappeared.
 “In that case, I won’t stop you.” Han Yu smiled.
 Qin Ling laughed.
 Han Yu sighed. “I didn’t expect you to have already grown so powerful. You can hold your own and are even stronger than me. It really makes me happy.”
 me!”
 “You’re the only one who knows how to talk.”
 “Hehe.”
 Qin Ling left several months later.
 Han Yu stood at the edge of the cliff as he watched him leave.
 1on
 At this moment, he truly felt that Qin Ling had grown up.
 Han Yu felt inexplicably empty.
 Han Yu couldn’t help but think of Han Jue.
 The Hidden Sect had nurtured countless geniuses, and many had even made a name for themselves in the Chaos.
 Would the ancestor be as dejected as him?
 “Impossible…”
 Han Yu couldn’t help but laugh, feeling that he was being silly.
 In the next hundred years, Qin Ling’s reputation as a prodigy was frequently mentioned in the Immortal World. First, many Sages said that his talent was the strongest. Then, Qin Ling challenged everyone everywhere to prove his strength.
 No one could hurt Qin Ling. They were all forcefully suppressed by him.
 At the same time, the Divine Palace began to create momentum for Xia Zhizun.
 In the next five thousand years, Qin Ling and Xia Zhizun’s reputation reached its peak. They became peerless geniuses that everyone in the Immortal World knew. Until one day.
 These two unparalleled geniuses of the Immortal World actually agreed to fight at the peak of Kunlun Mountain, shaking the Immortal World!
 The day of the final battle arrived. Billions of cultivators surrounded Kunlun Mountain and watched from afar.
 This battle was world-shattering!
 All the cultivators watching the battle were convinced. As expected of a peerless genius.
 The two peerless geniuses were on par. In the end, they perished together and self-destructed, fighting to the death.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du took action and protected the two souls. Because they had caused huge destruction to the Immortal World and accidentally injured countless spectators, Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du let them reincarnate and awaken in the mortal world.
 Two unparalleled geniuses appeared in the same era and died together!
 This battle became a legend that lasted for thousands of years. Not only in the Immortal World but also in the myriad worlds and even in the Chaotic Heavenly Road.
 Perhaps they had not reached the Sage Realm, but their talent was left behind by countless cultivators in the future.
 Their future would be limitless if they didn’t die young!
 It was precisely because of this that many cultivators even believed that their deaths were caused by Sages, afraid that two more Pangu would appear!
 Netherworld.
 In the Yama Hall.
 Yang Tiandong looked at Qin Ling, who was tied up by the soul chains in the hall, and sighed. “Not bad, not bad. Although he’s dead, he still fought for the Hidden Sect.”
 Qin Ling’s expression was originally indifferent. Hearing this, he couldn’t help but be moved. He asked cautiously, “The King of Hell has a relationship with the Hidden Sect?”


 “I do have a relationship with the Hidden Sect, and we are more than close,” Yang Tiandong said casually with a casual expression.
 Qin Ling’s curiosity was piqued. “Which disciple of the Hidden Sect is familiar with the King of Hell?”
 He respected the Hidden Sect very much. Although he was doing well and stirring up trouble in the Immortal World, he knew that he was not ranked at all in the Hidden Sect.
 How many Sages had the Hidden Sect nurtured?
 The number of geniuses was countless!
 Millions of disciples were cultivating in the Hundred Peak Immortal River. The world would definitely be shocked once they were released.
 Yang Tiandong cleared his throat and was about to posture when a voice entered his ears.
 Yang Tiandong suddenly felt pity for Qin Ling. The unparalleled prodigy who had shocked the Immortal World was actually a pawn.
 Why didn’t the Hidden Sect protect him?
 Yang Tiandong thought of Han Jue and suddenly realized that Qin Ling, who was very powerful in his eyes, might not catch Han Jue’s eye at all.
 He immediately felt bored and lost the mood to posture.
 He waved his hand and said, “Go and reincarnate. I’ll talk to you in the next life.”
 Although Qin Ling was puzzled, he did not say anything. He would reincarnate first.
 The Black and White Deities left with his soul.
 Yang Tiandong fell into endless memories.
 What would have happened to him now if he had obeyed his master’s orders back then?
 Unfortunately, his potential was not good.
 Su Qi was also disobedient and even caused a calamity, causing the Heavenly Dao to restart. Wasn’t he still a Sage now?
 In the end, he was unlucky and did not have great providence.
 Yang Tiandong sighed. He looked at his King of Hell Hall and felt depressed and melancholic.
 Actually, this was good too.
 There was no need to worry about life and death. He stayed here all day and watched as the tides rose and fell.
 This was also a status and power that he had never dared to imagine attaining.
 Yang Tiandong smiled and became happy again.
 In a mysterious space that only had white light, dozens of black shadows gathered. Their true appearance could not be seen. They were all facing an extremely huge black shadow.
 “Divine Lord Xin Yu died very quickly. He couldn’t resist at all. Before he died, he sent me this face,” the huge black shadow said in a low voice. As soon as he finished speaking, two red lights burst out from his eyes and interwove, condensing into the image of the Dark Forbidden Lord.
 The Dark Forbidden Lord looked very similar to the surrounding black shadows, but his body was surrounded by black flames. Most importantly, he held an axe.
 “Who is this person?”
 “Was he harmed by fate?”
 “Wait, isn’t this axe the Heaven-Opening Axe?”
 “Previously, Heavenly Dao’s Pan Xin pestered me and said that Life had stolen his Heaven-Opening Axe. Could it be…”
 “How is that possible? How can such a Supreme Treasure be stolen? I’m afraid he’s acting!”
 “But Pan Xin is only a Freedom Sage. How can he easily kill a Great Dao Sage?”
 Dozens of black shadows began to argue.
 Shi Dudao, Ancestor Xitian, and Li Daokong were also among them.
 Shi Dudao was secretly puzzled. Why did the Dark Forbidden Lord want to kill Life?
 Wasn’t Life created by him?
 He suddenly felt that he could not see through it anymore.
 The huge black shadow said, “Do you think he’s the Dark Forbidden Lord?”
 Dark Forbidden Lord?!
  All the black shadows were stunned.
 Most of them did not know much about the Dark Forbidden Lord. They had only heard of him. It was said that the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End swept through the Heavenly Dao. The reason why it failed time after another was not only because the Heavenly Dao had given birth to a Chaotic Fiendcelestial, but also because of the Dark Forbidden Lord.
 A black shadow said, “Isn’t the Dark Forbidden Lord only good at curses?”
 The huge black shadow said in a low voice, “After thinking about it, it can only be the Dark Forbidden Lord. He cursed me before, even though he couldn’t hurt me at all. It proves his motive. The Dark Forbidden Lord saved Divine Lord Peacock probably to nurture him. We don’t know how many mighty figures he has under him.
 “Next, we want you to spread the news that the Dark Forbidden Lord is killing Life and is preparing to overturn the Chaos. The Devil Ancestor will definitely appear. The Chaotic Fiendcelestials and the Eternal Deities will each form a race. The Chaos is already in chaos, so let’s make it more chaotic!
 “Chaos is a great battle! The Chaos will only shatter in the battle. At that time, darkness will descend!”
 Dozens of black shadows agreed.
 Shi Dudao guessed.
 When darkness descended…
 He remembered that before he encountered Life, the Dark Forbidden Lord had told him that when the darkness descended, it would be the day the Dark Forbidden Lord appeared.
 From the looks of it, the so-called Life was only a pawn of the Dark Forbidden Lord.
 The current conflict was probably because the Dark Forbidden Lord wanted Life to act faster.
 He had indeed been a little lazy recently.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and frowned.
 He had been in seclusion for ten thousand years ever since he saved Divine Lord Peacock.
 He was getting closer and closer to breaking through. He took out the Book of Misfortune. It had long been upgraded and was now a Great Dao Supreme Treasure.
 It had been too long since he had cursed. He wasn’t used to it.
 He immediately started cursing the First Life Black Sovereign. He would curse for five days and end it before his lifespan decreased.
 “Awesome.”
 Han Jue put away the Book of Misfortune and started to observe the Heavenly Dao.
 The reason why he had only entered seclusion for ten thousand years was to see Qin Ling.
 Qin Ling had already reincarnated. His background was the same as the Sages’ plan. His village was attacked by demons and Buddhas. When he subdued the demons, he accidentally killed Qin Ling’s parents. Qin Ling began to seek revenge and visit the immortals.
 At the age of 37, he finally met an expert from the Divine Palace and joined it.
 Qin Ling was still cultivating in the Divine Palace.
 Xia Zhizun had already reincarnated and was still a disciple of the Divine Palace. He did not hide his background, so after his reincarnation, he was still respected by the disciples. However, he couldn’t remember everything about his previous life and could only know from his fellow disciples that he was very powerful in his previous life.
 They were both in the Divine Palace, and Xia Zhizun was the center of attention, while Qin Ling was only an ordinary disciple.
 The two of them looked like they would never interact.
 Han Jue looked away after a while.
 He believed that the Sages would not dare to act recklessly. If anyone really dared, he would show the dignity of the Divine Might Heavenly Sage.
 It had been a long time since Han Jue used force on the Sages. He guessed that the new Sages didn’t know his strength very well.
 Then, he began to check his emails. (Your good friend Yi Tian was attacked by Chaotic Devil Insects] x990028743 [Your son Han Tuo was attacked by Chaotic Devil Insects] x902836722
 (Your good friend Shi Dudao was attacked.]

 (Your good friend Li Daokong was attacked.)
 (Your good friend Evil Heavenly Emperor has obtained a Chaotic Supreme Treasure. His providence has increased greatly.]
 Han Jue showed a frown.
 Huang Zuntian was loyal. He couldn’t ignore him.
 After some thinking, Han Jue decided to visit Huang Zuntian in his dreams.
