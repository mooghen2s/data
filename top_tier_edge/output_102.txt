 said bluntly as the Fusang Tree was hemmed and hawed.
 He didn’t want to beat around the bush.
 The Fusang Tree was stunned. “Of course I want to, but…”
 Before she could finish speaking, it suddenly changed. The huge tree body emitted a dazzling light. These lights quickly condensed and landed in front of Han Jue, forming a graceful figure.
 It was a woman with black hair and snow-white skin. Her facial features were devastatingly beautiful, and the coldness between her brows had Li Yao’s bearing. This was normal. Dao Comprehension Sword and the Fusang Tree were both deeply affected by Li Yao.
 At first glance, the transformed Fusang Tree looked like Li Yao’s younger sister.
 Han Jue raised his hand and plucked a leaf from the Fusang Tree. It turned into a green robe and covered the Fusang Tree.
 The Fusang Tree turned around and discovered that its main body was still there. It seemed to have been stripped out, but she could clearly feel that she could control the tree. This feeling was extremely strange.
 Han Jue said, “From now on, you are in charge of controlling space-time. It’s Chaotic Space-time now. In the future, you will be in charge of all space-time in the Endless Era. I give you absolute divine authority over space-time.”
 The Dominator Brush suddenly appeared in front of him and he waved it at the Fusang Tree. In an instant, the Fusang Tree’s cultivation level soared, shaking the void.
 Divine senses attacked from all directions, wanting to spy on the Fusang Tree, but Han Jue easily isolated them.
 In just a few hours.
 The Fusang Tree’s cultivation was already
 The Creator Lord decided everything!
 After the Fusang Tree woke up, it felt its creation and was in a daze. She knelt down excitedly after being stunned for a while.
 “Thank you, Master. Thank you, Master.”
 “Yes, that’s all.”
 Han Jue turned around and continued forward.
 The Fusang Tree hurriedly asked, “Master, I
 betrayed the Hidden Sect previously. Why didn’t you blame me and even give me such power?”
 Han Jue didn’t even turn around. “I can do whatever I want. I can treat whoever I want well. Just be grateful that I raised you.
 “I can take back everything I gave you today at any time. How you control this power depends on your performance.”
 The Fusang Tree bit her lips and immediately stood up as she looked at Han Jue’s departing
 figure, flying towards him.
 “Master, I’m willing to serve you.”
 “There’s no need for that.”
 “I’m sincere. You’re so powerful now. Perhaps
 cultivating with you is the right path. After hundreds of millions of years, I’m no longer
 curious about the Chaos and all existence. I only want to cultivate well. As for the order of
 space-time, I can multitask.”
 “Alright, then follow,” Han Jue replied
 casually. To the current him, there was no
 burden.
 He had indeed never blamed the Fusang Tree. He could even understand and pity it.
 If it were him, he would also never be able to
 transform. The people around him had no choice but to make a living. The Fusang Tree did not betray him, she only left him. In the past, Han Jue and the Hidden Sect
 relied on the Fusang Tree’s Spirit Qi to cultivate. The Fusang Tree didn’t owe them anything, and they had no reason to blame
 her.
 The Fusang Tree felt relieved and smiled brightly after obtaining Han Jue’s agreement. She went forward and walked side by side
 with him.
 “Master, what realm are you at now? You
 should have surpassed the Great Dao Supreme Realm, right? I’ve witnessed your battles. You once destroyed all living beings in the Chaos and revived them.”
 The Fusang Tree kept asking questions, making Han Jue feel that Han Qing’er was
 beside him.
 “Yes, I’ve already surpassed it. Above the
 “The Chaos is so big. You can grow from a
 mortal to a Creator in less than 500 million years. You’re really impressive!” The Fusang Tree sighed, its eyes filled with anticipation.
 Han Jue.
 Just like that, the two of them chatted as they traveled the Chaos.
 was finally decided. Han Huang won and
 repelled the two Dao Creator clones. “The weak Chaos can’t withstand a single blow. Let’s end it. Primordial Chaos, listen up.
 Chaos. Even mortals could hear it. It was soul-stirring.
 The Fusang Tree sighed. “Master, he’s really
 powerful. As expected of your son.” “It’s alright. Not bad.”
 Han Jue smiled. Actually, he was also very
 satisfied.
 This time, Han Huang did not use the
 Ultimate Origin Power to repel the two Dao Creator clones.
 What did that mean?
 of the Chaotic Consciousness and Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction Venerable at the same realm!
 After all, Han Huang was a Primordial Fiendcelestial. Their foundation was far
 inferior to his. They only took advantage of
 their age.
 A terrifying roar resounded throughout the
 Chaos not long after Han Huang’s declaration ended.
 Primordial Despair!
 This ferocious beast personally nurtured by Han Huang was born for the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity. Not only could it
 speed up the death of all living beings, but it could also devour providence. When the providence was sucked dry, the power of the
 Chaos would decrease greatly and Han Huang could easily shatter the Chaos. Han Huang still had selfish motives. He
 wasn’t thinking about the Endless Era, but about creating the Primordial Chaos. The true way to activate the Endless Era was
 to gather the providence of the Chaos and use
 absolute power to shatter the basic rules of the blank domain and change it. This idea was suggested by the Ninth Chaos, but it was actually wrong. Han Jue knew how strong the basic rules of
 matter how he cultivated in the future. What
 he needed to do was to sense the blank domain.
 The only person who could create the Endless Era was Han Jue!
 It depended on his intentions.
 “It depends on whether you can satisfy me.
 history.”
 Han Jue smiled slightly.
 The Fusang Tree thought that he was looking
 at Han Huang, so it kept sighing at how
 powerful he was. Han Jue clearly saw seven powerful forces attacking from the blank domain, including the Ninth Chaos’ clone. The Nine Great Chaos
 prepared to descend into the Chaos and fight together.
 According to the previous development pattern, this would be a turning point. Primordial Origin would appear when Han Huang could not win. The appearance of the two Primordial Fiendcelestials forced the
 Ninth Chaos to appear.


 Seven powerful forces rushed over and descended on the Nine Extremes Orthodoxy with unstoppable force when the Primordial Chaos began to slaughter all living beings in the Chaos.
 Less than a thousand years later, the Nine Extremes Orthodoxy launched a counterattack against the Primordial Chaos. The Nine Great Chaos killed the Primordial Army and stopped its attack.
 The Nine Extremes Orthodoxy brought hope to the Chaos. More and more wandering living beings and the Chaotic factions crushed by the Primordial Chaos began to join them.
 The names of the Nine Great Chaos also began to spread. The legend of the Chaos fighting the Primordial Chaos appeared out of nowhere and spread throughout the chaotic void.
 Han Jue and the Fusang Tree traveled the various worlds. Occasionally, they would encounter battles between the Chaos and Primordial Chaos, but they couldn’t hurt them.
 On this day.
 Han Jue and the Fusang Tree came to a world. This was the territory of the Dao Heavenly Race. It was like the Heavenly Dao Human Race. Even the architectural style of the cities was similar.
 As expected of a race created by Pangu and the Dao Ancestor.
 a system notification appeared in front of him
 as Han Jue walked in the endless crowd.
 [The main Dao Field has been successfully upgraded.]
 [The second Dao Field has been successfully upgraded.]
 [The third Dao Field has been successfully upgraded.]
 [The Dao Field has been upgraded. The array formation has been upgraded to unlimited strength. It has expanded the internal space of the Dao Field.]
 [The various Spirit Qi in the Dao Field have
 increased by a thousand times.]
 [The Dao Field can block all prying eyes.]
 Unlimited strength?
 In other words, even a Creator Lord couldn’t
 barge into the Dao Field.
 Although the system and Han Jue
 for an extremely long time. The energy accumulated would naturally exceed his
 realm.
 Han Jue didn’t care too much and continued forward.
 The cultivation levels of the people here were all very high. They were born in the Immortal Realm. Just in this city, Han Jue discovered hundreds of Primordial Chaos Sages.
 The Fusang Tree was also very interested in the Dao Heavenly Race. She had not noticed that such a human-like race had actually appeared in the Chaos. It was too impressive.
 At this moment, great pressure descended, causing everyone on the street to stop and
 look up.
 No one panicked. They only looked up calmly, already used to it.
 “Dao Heavenly Race, listen up. Prepare yourselves in a year. Next year, we will go to
 the Chaotic Nine Extremes Orthodoxy. Everyone, be it men or women, old or young,
 fight!”
 This was Hong Jun’s voice.
 The Dao Heavenly Race did not panic. Instead,
 most of them revealed excited and expectant expressions.
 Han Jue could already see where the Dao Ancestor’s true body was.
 This fellow split his soul into billions of parts.
 Hong Jun was one of them. His main soul hid in the blank domain and relied on a Karma
 Dharma treasure. This Karma Dharma treasure was an Ultimate Dao Treasure. Ordinary Dao Creators couldn’t deduce him.
 In the past, Han Jue still treated the Dao Ancestor as a potential threat. Now, he no longer cared, so he couldn’t be bothered.
 “Master, should we go take a look?” the Fusang Tree asked expectantly. The Nine Extremes Orthodoxy was like the sun in the sky. The Dao Heavenly Race actually dared to attack them. This battle would definitely be explosive.
 Han Jue smiled. “Sure.”
 He also wanted to see the Nine Chaos’
 strength.
 “You can follow the Dao Heavenly Race. I have something to do and have to leave. See you on the battlefield.”
 With that, Han Jue disappeared. The Fusang Tree hurriedly searched for his
 aura, but she couldn’t find him no matter what. Helpless, she could only listen to his arrangements.
 Ancient Primordial World.
 Primordial Origin was still meditating and
 absorbing the Primordial Power of this world.
 “Your cultivation is not bad. You’re indeed worthy of the name of the Primordial Fiendcelestial.”
 A voice sounded, startling Primordial Origin.
 He immediately became vigilant when he saw who it was.
 “You are…”
 Primordial Origin frowned. Han Jue’s
 cultivation realm was high. Other than
 familiar people, even if others saw him, they would subconsciously forget him.
 Primordial Origin to not know his relationship with him.
 Han Jue raised his hand and waved, directly
 stripping Huang Zuntian from Primordial
 Origin’s body. Primordial Origin’s body instantly began to collapse. His flesh and blood collapsed like mud, startling him so much that he hurriedly
 cast a spell and forcefully recovered his body. However, without Huang Zuntian’s soul, he could not control this Primordial Fiendcelestial’s body. Huang Zuntian was also stunned when he
 disappeared. His body split into two, one fused with Huang Zuntian.
 Han Jue asked, “Huang Zuntian, do you want
 to kill him?”
 Huang Zuntian came back to his senses and
 looked at his hands in disbelief, his heart
 filled with shock. Impossible! What kind of method was this?
 What was Master’s cultivation level?
 He asked carefully, “Why do you want me to choose?”
 Han Jue smiled. “Don’t worry. It’s really me. We don’t need the secret signal anymore. Now, I’ll kill him as long as you want him to die.”
 Huang Zuntian took a deep breath and tried his best to calm down.
 He said, “What if I don’t want him to die?”
 Previously, the reason why he wanted to kill
 had
 Primordial Origin was that the threat was too great. But now, it seemed that the threat already disappeared because of Han Jue. “From now on, you will all be Primordial Fiendcelestials. Your bodies are equivalent to twin brothers,” Han Jue replied. Huang Zuntian looked at Primordial Origin.
 know what this fellow had done just now. It was too unbelievable to turn the Primordial Fiendcelestial’s body into two, right? Didn’t that mean that he could use Huang
 Zuntian’s body to create countless Primordial
 Fiendcelestials?
 The more Primordial Origin thought about it, the more afraid he became. Why was there such an existence?
 Han Jue looked at Primordial Origin and said,
 “Han Huang is my son. You wanted to evolve into a Primordial Fiendcelestial and failed. It’s not because of him, but because of me. The Chaos only allows one Primordial Fiendcelestial. My son was also nurtured in
 his mother’s womb for millions of years because of my existence.” Primordial Origin’s eyes widened. Huang Zuntian was the same.
 This matter was too shocking.
 Didn’t the Chaos recognize the Divine Might Heavenly Sage as a Chaotic Fiendcelestial? “The Endless Era is about to arrive. The old
 rules will eventually die. There will be more than one Primordial Chaos in the future,’ Han Jue said slowly. The reason why he saved Primordial Origin was that he felt that he was too similar to him.
 became a threat.
 From the looks of it, it was almost impossible. The Primordial Fiendcelestial and the Ultimate Origin Fiendcelestial were far too different in strength.


 Primordial Origin couldn’t calm down. He had all sorts of thoughts, but he knew one thing.
 The person in front of him could easily control his life!
 He was clearly already very strong. It had been a long time since he was so helpless and afraid. The difference in strength between them was too great.
 Primordial Origin adjusted his state of mind and bowed respectfully.
 No matter what, Han Jue had given him a new life. He should do this.
 Han Jue said, “What you want to do next is up to you. I’m also looking forward to your performance.”
 With that, he vanished.
 Primordial Origin was stunned. He and Huang Zuntian looked at each other and fell silent.
 At first glance, the two of them seemed to be looking in the mirror.
 There was a long silence.
 Huang Zuntian said, “Can you change your appearance? I don’t mind giving you half of my body, but I mind you wearing my appearance.”
 Primordial Origin came back to his senses and immediately changed his appearance to
 another face. They still looked somewhat similar, like brothers.
 Huang Zuntian smiled in satisfaction. This was also good.
 Huang Zuntian had long agreed with Primordial Origin. The previous conflict was only because Primordial Origin had possessed him. The two of them fought over a body. There was no choice then. But they didn’t need to fight anymore now.
 It seemed that Huang Zuntian had given in, but without Primordial Origin, Huang Zuntian could not have reached this point.
 “What are you going to do next?” Huang Zuntian asked. He was also thinking about this question.
 Primordial Origin replied, “Of course, we’ll
 join forces and help Han Huang. The three Primordial Fiendcelestials will create an Endless Era together. This is the righteous path. We only have this path to choose.”
 He had been paying attention to the Chaos. The appearance of the Nine Great Chaos turned the tide. The Primordial Chaos began to lose. Perhaps this was the reason why Han Jue saved him.
 There was no free lunch in the world. There was always a cause and effect.
 Huang Zuntian felt relieved and smiled. “That makes sense. When are we taking action?”
 “Sure!”
 Fiendcelestial.
 power?
 In the center of the Chaos.
 The void was dilapidated with countless corpses floating around. A terrifying figure crawled in the void, chewing on tens of thousands of feet tall bodies. It was Primordial Despair.
 In the distance.
 A Great Dao Sage trembled. He was locked
 onto by Primordial Despair’s eye and could not move. His body was covered in coldness.
 “What kind of monster is this…”
 The Great Dao Sage’s voice trembled. He had lived for billions of years and experienced countless storms. He had even participated in
 the crusade against the Divine Might Heavenly Sage, but he had never encountered
 such a terrifying existence.
 Although the Divine Might Heavenly Sage was
 strong, he would not torture the enemy. This monster’s eyes froze his soul and Dharmic powers, preventing him from escaping. He could only watch as it chewed on the tens of thousands of Freedom and Primordial Chaos disciples under him.
 His heart bled. This was his fortune. What terrified him the most was that he
 didn’t know when Primordial Despair would eat him.
 He could only pray that a mighty figure from the Chaos could save him.
 But what cultivation level was that?
 He was a Great Dao Sage. Even a Great Dao
 Supreme couldn’t immobilize him with his gaze.
 What did that mean?
 Primordial Despair might have surpassed the Great Dao Supreme Realm!
 At this moment, Primordial Despair swallowed all the huge corpses and slowly flew towards him.
 This Great Dao Sage looked extremely tiny in
 front of the monster.
 “No-“
 The Great Dao Sage roared with a hint of
 hope.
 However, no mighty figure appeared to save
 him. The Primordial Despair swallowed him. The
 moment it entered his mouth, the Great Dao
 Sage recovered his main body. His figure was also huge, like Buzhou Divine Mountain, and like a demon. This was not his doing. It was a force of Primordial Despair that forced him to reveal his true form before chewing him and making him die in pain.
 Occasionally, there would be cracking sounds
 and the sound of water bubbling. It was extremely terrifying when they merged. In the distance.
 Someone was watching this scene.
 It was Han Jue.
 He touched his chin and muttered, “He has
 the Primordial Fiendcelestial bloodline. Could this fellow be…”
 That brat’s son, right?
 He observed carefully and was even more
 certain now.
 Primordial Despair was Han Huang’s son.
 Han Huang’s bloodline was too high-level. Goddess Ming Ji couldn’t withstand it, so he could only give birth himself.
 This was very normal in the Chaos. Not many
 races needed men and women to give birth to offspring. Many mighty figures liked to
 reproduce themselves to preserve their bloodline potential as much as possible. Primordial Despair looked like a ferocious beast, but it actually had its own intelligence. It was like a three or four-year-old child wandering in its curious world. The living
 beings it ate were like ants in its eyes. Eating
 them did not make it feel guilty, and it was not very excited.
 As it devoured living beings, Primordial Despair also became stronger bit by bit. Most importantly, wherever it went, providence would be devoured by it. It was equivalent to
 constantly shattering the territory of the
 Chaos.
 Interesting, Han Jue thought silently.
 In that case, Primordial Despair was equivalent to his grandson. Han Jue transformed, and his entire body turned black. He landed on the fellow’s head.
 He transformed into the Dark Forbidden Lord. Primordial Despair did not sense his existence and continued forward.
 The terror of Primordial Despair had already spread in the Chaos. The Nine Extremes Orthodoxy was organizing a plan to suppress
 it.
 From time to time, Han Jue would feel divine
 sense sweep over them, but no mighty figure dared to approach Primordial Despair. A world appeared in front of him. It contained multiple universes and billions of galaxies. From a macro point of view, it looked like a
 ball of light.
 Primordial Despair opened his bloody mouth and swallowed the world in one gulp. Then, he chewed hard.
 This mouthful of dead mortals was unknown.
 Han Jue didn’t interfere.
 Even the humans who advocated morality
 would not blame children who burned ants’ nests. Several hundred years later. Finally, a large number of auras approached and besieged Primordial Despair. More than twenty Great Dao Supremes, more than a
 hundred Great Dao Sages, including a few auras that Han Jue was familiar with. Shi Dudao, Jing Tiangong, Ancestor Xitian, and the other Calamity Life Controllers! Han Jue was amused. He could let them fulfill
 their dreams and see the Dark Forbidden
 Lord.


 The lineup was very powerful!
 However, every mighty figure’s expression was not good because the powerful enemy they faced had left behind a terrifying legend in the Chaos. Already some Great Dao
 Supremes had died in the mouth of the evil devil.
 “Stop watching. We have to go all out in this battle. We can’t let our guard down.”
 Ancestor Xitian’s words pulled Shi Dudao’s attention back.
 The Life faction had been depressed for a period of time after Li Daokong had gone to support the Primordial Chaos ever since Huang Zuntian disappeared, so Ancestor Xitian had no choice but to support Shi Dudao as the new Life Lord.
 The current Life faction chose to support the Chaos. In the end, the Calamity Life
 Controller was also a Great Dao Providence Divine Authority of the Chaos. It was closely related to the Chaos, and they had no choice but to support it.
 As for Li Daokong, in their opinion, he was extremely stupid. For the sake of their so-called fellow-disciple relationship, he even risked his life.
 Shi Dudao said, “That Primordial Despair is too strong. Ancestor, do you have a way to deal with it?”
 He could already see Primordial Despair. Just looking at it from afar made him shiver.
 This was the first time he felt fear just by seeing the other party’s figure.
 Ancestor Xitian’s expression was solemn. He did not answer.
 How to deal with Primordial Despair was the greatest problem the Chaos encountered now. The Nine Great Chaos restrained Han Huang and the top disciples of the Hidden Sect. However, even so, Primordial Despair still made the Chaos unable to devour it.
 Jing Tiangong sighed. “It might be different if the Dark Forbidden Lord was here. Didn’t the Nine Extremes Orthodoxy claim to be closely related to him? Now that the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity is here, why hasn’t the Forbidden Lord appeared?”
 In the long years, this former elder of the Jie School had encountered too many storms. He would think of the Dark Forbidden Lord every time he was about to collapse.
 He had been looking forward to the moment
 when darkness enveloped the Chaos.
 This was also the anticipation of all Dark
 Forbidden Lord believers.
 “It’s not time yet.” Shi Dudao snorted.
 Oh Dark Forbidden Lord, he had long made a move. How could you guess his trap?
 Shi Dudao had always guessed that Han Jue was the Dark Forbidden Lord. The Divine Might Heavenly Sage and the Dark Forbidden Lord were one positive and one negative. One was white and the other was black. They had the power to control the sun, moon, and universe in their hands.
 Now, the Primordial Lord was the Divine Might Heavenly Sage’s son. The Chaotic Nine Extremes Orthodoxy believed in the Dark Forbidden Lord. It was not an exaggeration to
 say that the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity was controlled by the Dark
 Forbidden Lord.
 This method was too amazing!
 It was precisely because of this that Shi Dudao
 did not feel so much pressure.
 In his opinion, he would not die no matter
 which side he supported.
 Master will protect me!
 Ancestor Xitian shook his head. He was no
 longer able to persuade these two juniors. He didn’t know what the Dark Forbidden Lord had given them to make them so loyal.
 Soon, the mighty figures of the Chaos arrived near Primordial Despair. They were a billion kilometers away. This distance was already very dangerous. The terrifying aura emitted by Primordial Despair was enough to make them shiver.
 They knew that they might die, but they had no choice but to fight!
 “There’s someone above it!” a Freedom Sage exclaimed in disbelief.
 All the cultivators’ gazes landed on the top of Primordial Despair’s head. They saw an indiscernible black shadow sitting on it. Its
 body seemed to be burning with black flames.
 It was extremely strange.
 “That is…”
 Shi Dudao and Jing Tiangong widened their
 eyes and trembled. They were excited.
 Ancestor Xitian frowned.
 The leader’s Great Dao Supreme was one of
 the Ten Absolute Prodigies of the first Chaotic Assembly, Zhou Song’s Great Dao Heaven.
 The current Zhou Song’s Great Dao Heaven
 was already at the perfected Great Dao Supreme Realm. He was a peerless mighty figure whose name shook the Chaos. He
 opened the world, connected the Yin and Yang, knew the past and present, and was almost omnipotent.
 very nervous.
 Could the existence sitting on the head of Primordial Despair be the Primordial Fiendcelestial Han Huang?
 “Don’t panic. Han Huang is still fighting the
 Nine Great Chaos. This person is definitely not Han Huang. Prepare for battle!”
 Zhou Song’s Great Dao Heaven wore a red-patterned black robe with exquisite patterns embroidered on it. His clothes were
 domineering and gorgeous. His voice brought
 peace to all the mighty figures. Primordial Despair’s nine eyes spun crazily. Its huge body, which was larger than any
 star, slowly moved. It only needed to move to crush the intruders.
 The mighty figures dodged and surrounded
 him. The Freedom Sages quickly cast spells and placed formations. The Great Dao Sages took out the Chaotic Numinous Treasures and set them as pillars for various array formations. The Great Dao Supremes came to the top of Primordial Despair and used their Mystical Powers together. Terrifying Dharmic powers gathered together and shattered space. Endless spatial lightning descended like a thunder prison suppressing Primordial Despair. The vast light flood formed by Dharmic powers descended.
 Enduring the Dharmic powers of several Great Dao Supremes, Primordial Despair’s body did not tremble at all. Its eyes were still rolling crazily. All the mighty figures who looked at it were frozen in their Dharmic powers and souls, unable to move.
 In less than three breaths of time, most of the
Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎 Freedom Sages and Great Dao Sages who wanted to set up the array formation severed their Mystical Powers one after another. The array formation shattered.
 Han Jue watched the battle with interest as he sat on Primordial Despair’s head.
 was very strong. He had inherited Han Huang’s might.
 From this point of view, Han Jue and Han
 Huang were still two different living beings, be it bloodline or thoughts. Han Jue was also a Primordial Fiendcelestial
 in the past, but he still liked to have children with his Dao Companions. After all, his heart was human. He was a human at the beginning and was a Primordial Fiendcelestial who evolved from humans. He would also take care of his children.
 Han Huang was different. He was an Innate Primordial Fiendcelestial and did not think highly of his wife and children. He treated them as tools.
 The Primordial Fiendcelestial might not understand love and kinship at all. They didn’t need it, either.
 Boom!
 Primordial Despair suddenly opened the huge mouth of the abyss. The unstoppable suction force sucked the Freedom Sages and Great Dao
 Sages into its mouth. These prey returned to their true forms as soon as they entered its
 mouth. They were all huge, but in front of it, they were still tiny.
 The familiar chewing sound sounded again, filling the entire void.
 The Great Dao Supremes were so frightened
 that they immediately began to save the immobile cultivators.
 It was a one-sided battle!
 Their Dharmic powers couldn’t hurt Primordial Despair at all. At this moment…
 Zhou Song’s Great Dao Heaven suddenly
 appeared behind Han Jue. He formed
 seals
 with his right hand and struck out with his
 palm. A golden light seal burst out from his palm and quickly expanded, like a dazzling sun crashing into Han Jue.
 Boom-
 The golden seal shattered and Zhou Song’s
 Great Dao Heaven was drowned by the light. Many mighty figures in the distance were shaken until their senses lost their effect.
 Everyone looked over when the strong light dissipated.
 Gasp-
 Zhou Song’s Great Dao Heaven knelt behind
 Han Jue. He was covered in blood and his hair was disheveled. He was trembling. Zhou Song looked at Han Jue’s back in
 disbelief. A terrifying killing intent locked
 onto him, preventing him from healing his injuries.
 “You… Who are you?” Zhou Song’s Great Dao
 Heaven asked with a trembling voice. He had fought Han Huang before. Although he was not Han Huang’s match, he would not be defeated so quickly. He didn’t even see how the other party attacked.


 “Who do you think I am?” Han Jue smiled and asked with his back facing him.
 He still had an impression of this prodigy. He had performed well in the first Chaotic Assembly.
 One had to know that in the first Chaotic Assembly, although Han Huang had obtained the Eternal Peak, it was not an arbitrary advantage.
 Zhou Song’s Great Dao Heaven gritted his teeth. “Other than Han Huang, there’s actually an existence like you in the Primordial World. Could you be…”
 He did not continue.
 Because that name had too much influence!
 Divine Might Heavenly Sage!
 Because the Creation Emperor Court
 supported the Chaos, the mighty figures
 thought that the Divine Might Heavenly Sage would not interfere. If this was really the
 Divine Might Heavenly Sage, he would really be in despair.
 In the first Chaotic Assembly, the Divine Might Heavenly Sage had suppressed all the geniuses at that time, including him!
 Once he said the name of the Divine Might Heavenly Sage, all the cultivators present would lose their will to fight.
 He knew that he was invincible, so why struggle?
 No!
 He couldn’t let this go!
 He could only place his hopes on the Calamity Life Controller. The living beings of the Life faction were all Calamity Life Controllers and were related to the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority. They each had different special abilities.
 In any case, he was dead. It was better to strive to pose a threat to the Divine Might Heavenly Sage!
 “Everyone, stop!” Shi Dudao suddenly shouted, causing the Calamity Life Controllers who were preparing to attack to look at him.
 Shi Dudao knelt down in the void and shouted respectfully, “Shi Dudao greets the Dark Forbidden Lord!”
 Jing Tiangong knelt down as well. Their faces were filled with fanaticism.
 Ancestor Xitian sighed and did not stop him.
 Half of the members of the Life faction knelt
 down. The others looked at each other and were restless, not knowing what to do.
 “Dark Forbidden Lord?”
 Zhou Song’s Great Dao Heaven was stunned.
 He had naturally heard of the legend of the Dark Forbidden Lord. There were countless of them. Even the Nine Extremes Orthodoxy, which was at its peak, respected the Dark Forbidden Lord.
 Not the Divine Might Heavenly Sage?
 This did not make sense!
Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎 The Nine Extremes Orthodoxy supported the Chaos, so why did the Dark Forbidden Lord support the Primordial Chaos?
 Han Jue smiled. “This little fellow has a huge appetite. Leave quickly if you don’t want to die. I won’t restrain it.”
 With that, Primordial Despair roared, as if expressing anger. Don’t ignore it!
 Shi Dudao immediately understood and left with the Calamity Life Controllers. Primordial Despair continued to devour the other mighty figures, scaring them away.
 In less than a breath of time, only the sound of Primordial Despair chewing the corpses could be heard.
 Zhou Song’s Great Dao Heaven stood rooted to
 the ground. He did not expect this attack to
 end so quickly.
 He was utterly defeated.
 The Dark Forbidden Lord actually supported
 the Primordial Chaos.
 Oh no…
 Everything was over…
 Zhou Song’s Great Dao Heaven was ashen.
 Primordial Despair continued forward after swallowing the chewed prey in his mouth.
 Seeing that Han Jue had no intention of killing him, Zhou Song’s Great Dao Heaven couldn’t help but ask, “What do you want to do to me?”
 Han Jue didn’t answer.
 Zhou Song’s Great Dao Heaven was still
 Primordial Despair continued forward. The rumors of the Dark Forbidden Lord’s appearance quickly spread. This news was too shocking!
 The Nine Extremes Orthodoxy was the most
 affected.
 In the palace of the Nine Extremes Orthodoxy.
 Zhao Shuangquan flew into a rage out of humiliation. “Why does the Dark Forbidden Lord support Han Huang?”
 His gaze landed on the Nine-Headed Divine
 Spirit. The mighty figures of the other Nine Extremes Orthodoxy also looked at him. It was the Nine-Headed Divine Spirit’s suggestion to praise the Dark Forbidden Lord. The Primordial Ancestor God also snorted. He
 hated the Dark Forbidden Lord the most, so he was very unhappy with the Nine Extremes Orthodoxy’s method of beautifying him. Although the Nine-Headed Divine Spirit was loyal to the Ninth Chaos, he did not tell him many things.
 Yu Yuan said, “We have to suppress the Dark Forbidden Lord. Otherwise, the consequences will be unimaginable. The nine of us from the Chaos, move immediately!”
 He had only inherited the First Chaos’ will
 and was not the true First Chaos.
 The other Chaos agreed.
 The furious Zhao Shuangquan immediately
 agreed. They had to hurry up and attack before the news spread to the rest of the Chaos.
 …
 Primordial Hall.
 Han Huang sat at the head of the table and
 knew of the Dark Forbidden Lord’s
 appearance.
 The disciples of the Hidden Sect also discussed.
 “Why is the Dark Forbidden Lord supporting
 us?”
 “Speaking of the Dark Forbidden Lord, he stirred up the Heavenly Dao back then.” “Junior Huang, you have to be careful if you don’t know the Dark Forbidden Lord. This fellow likes to stir up trouble the most. If you
 “Yes, I’ve often been cursed ever since the Darkness Sect became popular.”
 “The Dark Forbidden Lord’s goal is Primordial
 Despair?” “It’s very likely. Primordial Despair is so
 powerful, but why can we spy on Primordial
 Despair but not see the Dark Forbidden Lord
 above it?”
 Everyone discussed. They were excited, panicked, and uneasy.
 The name of the Dark Forbidden Lord was too
 resounding.
 In fact, the Dark Forbidden Lord rarely made
 a move, but he could not stop the many disciples of the Darkness Sect. They fabricated all sorts of exaggerated legends and raised the Dark Forbidden Lord’s strength infinitely. Han Huang did not interrupt but pondered
 silently.
 He had never seen the Dark Forbidden Lord
 and could not even capture him. What did that mean?
 This meant that the Dark Forbidden Lord was
 very likely stronger than him! Damn it!
 Why did so many peerless mighty figures
 appear after the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity began?
 First, there were four half-step Creators, then
 the Nine Chaos, and now the Dark Forbidden
 Lord.
 Han Huang felt that he had lost control of the situation.
 He had underestimated the depths of the Chaos.
 If not for the Hidden Sect’s help, Primordial Chaos would probably have lost.
 Han Huang stood up and said, “I’ll go personally. All of you, continue to sit and guard the place. Li Daokong will be in charge while I’m not around.”
 With that, Han Huang disappeared.
 In the broken void.
 The advancing Primordial Despair stopped. Nine pillars of light that were unknown in height appeared in front of it. All of them
 emitted a terrifying aura as they approached
 it.
 The Nine Chaos!
 They all had the strength of half-step Dao Creators!
 If the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit was still
 alive, he would probably lose his mind!
 So many existences stronger than him! “Dark Forbidden Lord, why are you helping the Primordial Chaos?”
 Zhao Shuangquan’s voice sounded, clearly suppressing his anger.
 Han Jue replied, “Why should I tell you what I want to do?”
 “Don’t you know what our Nine Extremes Orthodoxy has done for you?” Zhao Shuangquan’s eyes turned red.
 “How arrogant! You’re courting death!” Zhao Shuangquan shouted angrily. He erupted with his full aura and charged. The other eight Chaos walked side by side. With every step, his aura increased greatly and broke through
 layers of alternate space.
