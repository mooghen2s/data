 Han Jue asked, “Do you have the urge to go out?”
 Su Qi had already grasped bad luck. He would no longer bring bad luck wherever he went like before.
 While Su Qi had yet to rise, Han Jue wanted him to fuse into the Heavenly Dao. Otherwise, even if Su Qi attained the Dao in the future, he wouldn’t be able to enter the Heavenly Dao.
 In this life, Su Qi had always been in the Dao Field and had never entered the Heavenly Dao. Han Jue had obtained a lot of Heavenly Dao merit before he attained the Dao. Hearing this, Su Qi said carefully, “If Master doesn’t let me out, I won’t go out.” Han Jue smiled. “Then, do you want to go out?” Su Qi was silent, not knowing how to answer.
 “It’s fine to go out. You can help all living beings and make up for your sins.” Han Jue smiled. After Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage was chased away, the Heavenly Dao next was considered united. They wouldn’t scheme more than before.
 After all, Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du and the other Sages had already announced that they would break up with the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End. It was impossible for spies to act like this.
 Su Qi hurriedly said, “I’ll follow Master’s instructions!”
 Han Jue immediately waved his sleeve and brought Su Qi to the 33rd Heaven, landing in front of the Universal Hall.
 The door to the Universal Hall opened and the master and disciple walked inside. Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du looked at Su Qi with a strange expression.
 This aura…
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said in a low voice, “He has the aura of death on him. Why don’t we confer him the title of Heavenly God of Death and let him control the dead in the world? He can be sent into the cycle of reincarnation to restrain Empress Houtu. The netherworld is the furthest from the Heavenly Dao. Empress Houtu has often left the Heavenly Dao recently. I have my doubts.”
 He was very calm when facing Han Jue.
 Han Jue said, “Sure. I’ll leave this matter to you. You can contact the other Sages.”
 “Yes, I’ll give my merit to your disciple and let him fuse into the Heavenly Dao.”
 “Thank you.”
 Su Qi hurriedly bowed.
 Han Jue disappeared. This was the first time Su Qi saw Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du. He was very nervous because the people who opened the Dao Field here were all Sages. Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du revealed a rare smile. “Don’t be nervous. I’ll tell you about the recent changes and let you understand the situation of the Heavenly Dao.”
 su Qi nodded.
 After returning to the Hundred Peak Immortal River, a line of words appeared in front of Han Jue.
 (Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du’s favorability towards you has increased. Current favorability: 6.5 stars]
 Another 6.5 stars! How sensible. Han Jue’s favorability towards Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du also increased.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du never plotted against Han Jue behind his back. He had the courage to face invincible enemies and even had his own principles and pursuits. Han Jue was still very satisfied to cooperate with such a Sage. In the next few days, the other Sages’ favorability toward Han Jue increased one after another. It was probably because of Su Qi. The Sages knew very well what a Chaotic Fiendcelestial meant. Although they didn’t understand how Han Jue obtained the Chaotic Fiendcelestial bloodline for Su Qi, there was one more Chaotic Fiendcelestial in the Heavenly Dao, and there would definitely be another safeguard in the future.
 A year later. Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du’s voice resounded through the myriad worlds. “From today onwards, Hidden Sect disciple Su Qi will be conferred the title of Heavenly God of Death. He will control the order of the dead and guard the netherworld. This is the arrangement of the Sages and the Heavenly Dao. All living beings can worship the new Heavenly God of Death.” Everyone was in an uproar. Heavenly God of Death! Another Hidden Sect disciple! How many mighty figures were hidden in the Hidden Sect? Netherworld.
 Yang Tiandong, who was dealing with the ghosts, was stunned. He smiled and muttered, “Junior Su Qi…”
 He thought that Su Qi’s arrival was Han Jue’s arrangement and that he was sent to protect him.
 Recently, the netherworld had indeed been a little chaotic. Some mysterious and unknown existences attacked the ghost servants from time to time. He had also been attacked and still didn’t know the other party’s true appearance. That day, Su Qi descended into the netherworld. The gods and ghost servants of the netherworld went to receive him. With his cultivation at the perfected Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm, Su Qi quickly convinced the crowd. He met Yang Tiandong and chatted with him, making the other Kings of Hell realize that they were on the same side. There were many Kings of Hell in the netherworld. All of them had their own forces and fought openly and secretly. Su Qi’s arrival meant that Yang Tiandong was about to rise.
 Inside the Daoist temple. Han Jue had just started cultivating when a notification suddenly appeared in front of him. [Empress Houtu sent you a dream. Do you accept?] Han Jue remained silent. He was on good terms with Empress Houtu. The matter of Su Qi had indeed oppressed her. She was probably here to question him.
 After hesitating for a moment, Han Jue still chose to accept the dream.
 Han Jue said, “Oh, you found out.”
 “Is the Dao Ancestor still alive? Is he supporting you from behind?” Empress Houtu changed the topic. Han Jue remained silent. Empress Houtu was enlightened. “I see. I will support Su Qi. The Six Paths of Reincarnation belong to the Heavenly Dao. The Heavenly Dao is formed by my father, Pangu. I will also do my best to protect the Heavenly Dao. You don’t have to worry that I will betray you. I left the Heavenly Dao because I was summoned by my brothers.”


 Han Jue asked in surprise, “Didn’t the Ancestral Magus die?”
 Could it be that the Ancestral Magus was like Dijun and Eastern Emperor and did not truly die? Empress Houtu said, “Indeed, but I also heard their calls.”
 “Have you found them?”
 “No.”
 “Be careful, it might be a trap.”
 Han Jue reminded. Although Empress Houtu was not a Heavenly Dao Sage, her status in the Heavenly Dao was very important. It would be troublesome if the netherworld was lost.
 Empress Houtu said, “I know. I won’t leave again. I sent you a dream this time mainly to ask if you arranged for Su Qi. If so, I’ll instill the providence of the Six Paths into his body to help increase his cultivation and let him control the power of reincarnation.”
 Han Jue was surprised. Empress Houtu was so generous? As if sensing his gaze, Empress Houtu explained, “I’ve been in this position for countless years. My cultivation level has not increased and I’m already numb. Su Qi is a Chaotic Fiendcelestial. Perhaps under his lead, the cycle of reincarnation can go further. I don’t believe the Sages. I only believe you. The reason why I believe you is that I can sense the growth of the Nether Race. If the Heavenly Dao needs a leader, you are the best choice in my eyes.”
 [Empress Houtu’s favorability towards you has increased. Current favorability: 6 stars]
 Empress Houtu’s favorability toward Han Jue was already extremely high. However, it had been rising and falling over the years. Now, it could still increase her favorability. It seemed that what she said was true.
 Indeed, if he wanted the others to unite, he had to have absolute strength!
 If not for Han Jue being strong enough, how could the Sages be so united?
 (Ten billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?) Continue!
 Han Jue entered the illusion. At this moment, his heart skipped a beat.
 In other words, the Heavenly Dao would still face danger!
 Han Jue opened his eyes and discovered that he was in front of the Universal Hall. Countless figures were standing in front of the Universal Hall. All of them emitted a powerful aura. Han Jue glanced at them.
 Wow!
 More than a hundred Sages! The others were all Pseudo-Sages!
 How many years had it been since the Heavenly Dao had developed to this point?
 Boom
 The door to the Universal Hall opened, and Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du and a group of Sages walked out. A few of them made Han Jue feel unfamiliar.
 Li Daokong, Shi Dudao, and Fang Liang were among them. Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du had a solemn expression. The other Sages were the same.
 “Are you prepared to face the supreme power of the Chaos?” Emperor Xiao shouted in a low voice that resounded outside the 33rd Heaven. “I swear to protect the Heavenly Dao!” The mighty figures gathered near the Universal Hall replied in unison. This scene made Han Jue think of the future of the Heavenly Court. Could it be that they were facing the same enemy? Furthermore, the Heavenly Court had lost!
 Han Jue sensed something and suddenly looked up. He saw a pair of eyes appear in the darkness at the peak of the Heavenly Dao, looking down at it. In front of these eyes, the entire 33rd Heaven looked tiny. What a cold gaze! Even Han Jue felt a chill in his heart. This was a suppression of cultivation realm. Han Jue subconsciously lowered his head and didn’t dare to look at the other party. If he was already like this, let alone the others. “Everything is just fabricated. I want to create reality!”
 A voice sounded. In an instant, a dazzling white light filled the 33rd Heaven, causing everything to lose its color.
 The illusion shattered. It meant the Heavenly Dao died! Han Jue opened his eyes and frowned. He had heard that voice before. A long time ago, it had pulled him into a dream and said the same thing.
 Illusion...
 Who was it?
 Han Jue frowned.
 This mysterious existence was definitely not born in the future. It might already be a powerful existence now.
 The Heavenly Court, which had swept through the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End, could not stop him.
 The Heavenly Dao that had formed its own rules was easily destroyed by him! That power was definitely not that of a Transcendent Dao Expert. It was definitely stronger!
 Han Jue was filled with pressure. It wasn’t terrifying to have many enemies. What was terrifying was not knowing who the enemies were.
 Han Jue gave up and wanted to ask who the voice was.
 [It involves karma that surpasses the current limits of the system. It cannot be deduced.]
 Han Jue frowned again. Hurry up and cultivate! The fiendcelestial army’s plan had to be sped up. Han Jue didn’t appear in the illusion just now. What did this mean?
 Han Jue guessed that he should have been frightened away or restrained. If it was the latter, it meant that the other party was not alone.
 Han Jue adjusted his state of mind. His Dao heart was as stable as a Buddha, and he quickly entered his cultivation state.
 “Come, connect them to the Dark Domain. You will be in charge of settling them down,” the Evil Heavenly Emperor replied. His gaze did not leave the two of them.
 “Yes.”
 The crack shrank and the voice vanished. The Evil Heavenly Emperor turned around and disappeared after saying, “I’ll leave them to you. Don’t disappoint me.”
 Black Heaven General hurriedly bowed.
 In the Immortal World. Another thousand years passed.
 These thousand years were extremely exciting. The Sages preached the Dao in the Dao Field one after another and even took in many disciples to travel the heavens and teach Dao techniques. The Sages after unity were still very impressive. In just a thousand years, with their help, many prodigies appeared in the Immortal World. The providence of the Heavenly Dao had greatly increased.
 Not only that, but the Sages had also established Chaotic Cities at the edge of the Immortal World. There were already nine Chaotic Cities now. It was worth mentioning that a race had been rapidly rising in the past thousand years. Human Race! With Li Daokong’s help, the self-imposed Human Race rose again.


 roots.”
 However, what really satisfied him was the actions of the Sages. They were all thinking of ways to increase the strength of the Heavenly Dao. At this moment, the Sages no longer cared about the conflict between sects. They preached the Dao to all living beings and did not force them to enter their sects.
 With them managing the Heavenly Dao and making it stronger, Han Jue could cultivate in peace.
 His gaze landed on Han Yu. This fellow was helping the Human Race. His status in the Human Race was now second only to the Human Emperor. Even the Human Emperor was polite to him. Han Yu, who had traveled the world alone, finally settled down. He also married and had children in the Human Race.
 Han Jue didn’t care about Han Yu’s children. Their bloodline was too far apart. The reason why he liked Han Yu was that he looked like him.
 To be honest, he didn’t have much feelings for Han Yu.
 It was worth mentioning that Long Hao actually started hanging out with Han Yu because of his appearance. “This brat isn’t controlling the Dragon Race. What’s he doing there?” Han Jue muttered to himself. He didn’t want to warn him. If Long Hao went against his will, he would just expel him from the sect in the future.
 In any case, the Evil Heavenly Emperor didn’t care about his youngest son. Han Jue closed his eyes again and entered cultivation.
 Time passed quickly in the peaceful Immortal World.
 Ten thousand years passed like a dream. Han Jue was finally close to breaking through to the mid-stage of the Freedom Primordial Chaos Realm.
 He hadn’t broken through for nearly thirty thousand years. He was really not used to it. His potential was still lacking. Han Jue sighed secretly. Of course, he was just joking. His breakthrough speed could revive the dead Pangu out of anger. Han Jue opened the emails to check. The Immortal World was too peaceful, causing him to almost relax. He had to look at his friends to calm down.
 (Your good friend Evil Heavenly Emperor was attacked by a mysterious Dao Devil] x8920312
 (Your son Han Tuo was attacked by an Inauspicious Evil) x44032
 (Your disciple Zhou Fan obtained the Dao in your enemy’s Seven Dao Sage’s dream. His cultivation has increased greatly.) (Your good friend Shi Dudao was attacked by your good friend Li Daokong] x3 (Your disciple Su Qi has absorbed the providence of reincarnation and stepped into the Pseudo-Sage Realm.]
 The last time he read the emails was two thousand years ago. During this period of time, the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End was still very lively. Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du’s curse attracted Han Jue’s attention.
 He hoped that it was not a curse within the Heavenly Dao.
 Below, he saw Ancestor Xitian splitting open the world.
 It had to be a Great Dao Sage!
 Continue!
 A figure appeared in Han Jue’s mind and in front of him was: (Cundi: Great Dao Sage, Immeasurable Emperor, founder of the Buddhist Sect. Because you severed his karma with Qiu Xilai, he has developed hatred towards you. Current Hatred Points: 6 stars]
 This fellow!
 Han Jue raised his eyebrows. He was about to sharpen his blade.
 After the Chaotic Deity pretended to die, the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End was in chaos and the Heavenly Dao was not disturbed for the time being. Therefore, Han Jue didn’t continue cursing. However, Cundi attacked Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du at this moment. He had to suppress him. He could even use this opportunity to mislead Cundi into thinking that the Dark Forbidden Lord was Laozi of the Human School.
 The more Han Jue thought about it, the more he felt that it was feasible.
 Deity Realm of the Ruins of End, Thunderclap Monastery.
 Cundi found Jie Yin and said in a low voice, “The Dark Forbidden Lord is cursing me again!” Jie Yin frowned and let him meditate and circulate his energy.
 “Is he testing us, or is he going to kill us?” Jie Yin asked.
 “I’m not sure…” Cundi said with a dark expression.
 He looked angry, but he was extremely panicked inside.
 Even the Chaotic Deity couldn’t stop him, let alone him!
 Jie Yin asked, “Why did he suddenly start cursing you? Did you do something?” Facing Jie Yin, Cundi did not hide anything. After knowing the reason, Jie Yin cursed him. “Why are you cursing Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du? Not to mention the Dark Forbidden Lord, who can you provoke? Although Laozi’s been in seclusion, Xuan Du is his only personal disciple. He will definitely protect him.”
 Cundi was extremely aggrieved. He gritted his teeth and said, “Could the Dark Forbidden Lord be Laozi? The reason why I suspected it was Han Jue previously was that he was ruining our plan. However, Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du’s betrayal means that the Human School is suspicious. Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du had just descended to the Heavenly Dao and became friends with Han Jue. I even suspect that Han Jue is supported by the Human School! The new Sage of the Human School of the Heavenly Dao has also joined Han Jue. Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du doesn’t mind at all!”
 Jie Yin said faintly, “So what if he is? Don’t you understand? The point is not who the Dark Forbidden Lord is, but that he can kill us.”
 Cundi was silent.
 Jie Yin sighed. “Ever since you left the Heavenly Dao, your Dao heart has inflated and you’ve lost your previous vigilance.” Cundi said indignantly, “Then, what should we do now? He’s still cursing me!”
 Jie Yin stood up. “I’ll go find Laozi. If he really wants to curse you to death, I can’t help you.”


 He had already lost 500 trillion years of his lifespan!
 (Because of your curse, your enemy Cundi’s Dao heart was damaged.]
 Han Jue hesitated. Should he just kill this fellow?
 Kill!
 Wasn’t six stars of Hatred Points a clear sign! Han Jue gritted his teeth, and his eyes turned sinister. The Book of Misfortune emitted a black light that shone on his face. He looked so terrifying and evil.
 Han Jue’s lifespan decreased rapidly! 1 quadrillion years!
 [Because of your curse, your enemy Cundi developed mental demons.)
 2 quadrillion years!
 [Because of your curse, your enemy Cundi’s Dao heart shattered and his cultivation fell greatly.]
 3 quadrillion years!
 (Your enemy Cundi was sealed by your enemy Jie Yin and his cultivation turned into nothingness.)
 The moment the last email appeared, Han Jue’s curse missed. It made him feel as if he had suddenly stepped on air. Han Jue put away the Book of Misfortune and asked in his mind, “How long will it take for Cundi to recover his cultivation?”
 [Ten billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 His value had decreased so quickly? Han Jue was in a good mood.
 [It’s immeasurable. At least, it takes longer than the time it took him to cultivate to his current realm.]
 He was crippled!
 Han Jue smiled. Although he didn’t curse him to death, he had at least killed a potential enemy. Six stars of hatred was too blinding. Han Jue’s interpersonal relationships were ranked according to Hatred Points.
 He had to stay vigilant. Enemies were more important than good friends! After all, his enemy might take his life. Han Jue rested for a few hours and quickly entered his cultivation state. He wanted to break through as soon as possible.
 Outside the 33rd Heaven, Universal Hall. The Sages gathered. Other than Han Jue, even Empress Houtu was among them.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du had a strange expression as he said, “I just learned something.” He looked at Qiu Xilai. Qiu Xilai was expressionless and surprised. Could it be related to him?
 The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate asked, “Is it good or bad?”
 The other Sages were also nervous. Ever since they had broken up with the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End, they had been guarding against sudden attacks. Fortunately, it had always been very peaceful.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du took a deep breath and said, “The Ancestor of the Buddhist Sect, Cundi Sacred, was cursed by the Dark Forbidden Lord and died.”
 The Sages widened their eyes. The Buddhist Sect had always been a major force in the Immortal World. Its legends were even widespread.
 Who was Cundi?
 He was the Dao Ancestor’s disciple!
 Qiu Xilai was moved and secretly shocked. Ever since he had been subdued by Han Jue, he had lost his karma with Cundi. For this, Cundi had even cursed him in his dreams, without the bearing of a senior. Qiu Xilai really didn’t expect him to die.
 Shi Dudao was the happiest among them, but he didn’t show it.
 It was the Dark Forbidden Lord again! How strong was he? Li Daokong asked, “What’s the Dark Forbidden Lord’s attitude towards our Heavenly Dao? Why does he want to curse Cundi to death?”.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “I’m not sure about the Dark Forbidden Lord’s goal, but there’s one thing that shouldn’t be wrong. The Dark Forbidden Lord supports the Heavenly Dao. My master told me that Jie Yin found him and begged for mercy on Cundi’s behalf. Jie Yin thought that my master was the Dark Forbidden Lord. During this period of time, Cundi had been pretending to be the Dark Forbidden Lord to curse me. I just didn’t say it.” Heavenly Venerate Wufa snorted. “I was also cursed. So it was done by Cundi. That Dark Forbidden Lord might not necessarily support the Heavenly Dao. He just can’t stand Cundi’s impersonation.”
 “It’s also possible. No matter what, the Dark Forbidden Lord isn’t targeting us, right?”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du nodded with a smile.
 Back then, when he chose to support the Heavenly Dao, he had been under immense pressure. He didn’t expect things to go smoothly. He only needed to manage the Heavenly Dao well. The powerful enemies were all blocked by other mighty figures. “What does your master think of the Heavenly Dao?” Fang Liang suddenly asked.
 The Sages couldn’t help but look at Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du. Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du had indeed mentioned his master just now. Didn’t he say that they had already broken up?
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “My master, Laozi, has been cultivating in seclusion. He’s not in charge of the current Human School. My master cultivates the Grand Supreme Heartless Dao and does not support the Heavenly Dao, but he will also not support the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End. However, the fact that he can tell me this is also a good signal. If I can rope my master into the Heavenly Dao camp, the Heavenly Dao will be safe.
 “My master is the number one person below the Dao Ancestor. As long as he gives the order, the mighty figures of the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End will not dare to act recklessly.”
 Speaking of him, Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du’s tone was filled with respect. The Sages did not say anything. They wouldn’t question Laozi’s strength. However, it might not be a good thing if he descended into the Heavenly
 Dao.
 Shi Dudao caught the gazes of the Sages and smiled mockingly. He suddenly felt Li Daokong staring at him and immediately retracted his smile.
 “Hmph, this brat…”
 Shi Dudao was furious when he saw Li Daokong. This fellow came to fight with him whenever he had the time. It was really annoying. Emperor Xiao said, “The Ancient Desolate’s seal is about to break. I can already sense the aura of the Primordial Devil Race.”
 Primordial Devil Ancestor!
 He was suppressed by the Dao Ancestor in the Ancient Desolate and was the first batch of prisoners.
 Empress Houtu said, “Reincarnation can also sense the Ancient Desolate’s aura… Also…”
 She hesitated for a moment before continuing, “Are my brothers also sealed in the Ancient Desolate? I sensed their call earlier.”
 He suddenly thought of something and his expression changed. The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate asked, “What’s wrong? What did you think?”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du frowned. “Could the mighty figures who died in the past be sucked away by some great Mystical Power and suppressed in the Ancient Desolate?
 Currently, we only know that the Heavenly Sect Master and the Primordial Devil Race are suppressed in the Ancient Desolate, but in fact, the Ancient Desolate is very big.
 It’s even wider than the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End. Such a huge territory should have many mighty figures imprisoned within. The methods of the previous Dao Ancestor are unimaginable. He hid the truth of the Primordial Purple Qi from us. Could he also be hiding the secrets of the Ancient Desolate?” The Sages also frowned.
 Heavenly Venerate Wufa said, “In that case, could the Dark Forbidden Lord be the Dao Ancestor? Or someone under the Dao Ancestor?”
 The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate asked, “If he’s the Dao Ancestor, why did he design to release the cage he created?” It didn’t make sense! The Sages looked at Fang Liang. The Dao Ancestor’s avatar was here! Fang Liang’s expression darkened. It was unknown what he was thinking. Seeing his expression, the Sages’ hearts skipped a beat. Empress Houtu suddenly said, “I previously received a dream from Father when I was cultivating.”
 Her words shocked the Sages. Empress Houtu was an Ancestral Magus in the past!
 Who was the Ancestral Magus’ Father? The world creator, Giant God Pangu!


 The Universal Hall was silent.
 Three Thousand Chaotic Fiendcelestial Era! The Sages felt a chill.
 The current Chaos also had the existence of Chaotic Fiendcelestials.
 These Chaotic Fiendcelestials were all supreme existences that surpassed the three thousand laws and were unrestrained However, there was only a number of Chaotic Fiendcelestials. They were all tenacious existences who had survived the Fiendcelestial Era.
 Did Empress Houtu mean that these Chaotic Fiendcelestials were about to trigger the Chaotic Calamity?
 Chaotic Calamity… Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity! The Sages thought of the words left behind by the Dao Ancestor before he vanished and felt even more terrified.
 Their ability could only protect the Heavenly Dao. If the Great Dao Calamity affected the Heavenly Dao, could they withstand it? “I need the Jade Slip of Creation. Senior, please help me find it!” Fang Liang suddenly said.
 The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate asked, “What for?”
 Fang Liang said in a low voice, “Let the Heavenly Dao break through and expand to devour the Chaos, thereby stopping the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity.
 When the Dao Ancestor chose me, he mentioned the Ancient Desolate. He said that there was an extremely terrifying power hidden in the Ancient Desolate.
 The reason why he disappeared was to find a way to resist that power.
 The Sages were all shocked. Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du asked in a low voice, “Is that true?”
 Fang Liang said, “I, Fang Liang, swear to the Heavenly Dao that if I lie to you, the providence of the Heavenly Dao will dissipate on its own.” The Sages did not say a word and fell into deep thought. This conversation shocked them.
 They realized that things were not as simple as they had imagined. Other than resisting the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End, they had to be wary of existences of a higher level.
 “Who am I…”
 “Han Jue… Misfortune… Dark Forbidden Lord…”
 The black flames emitted a hoarse voice. Hearing it carefully, it was actually somewhat similar to Han Jue’s voice.
 The black flames produced a powerful suction force, stirring up a strong wind and forming a huge vortex. Chaotic Qi from all directions surged into the black flames. As time passed, the black flames grew larger and larger.
 After an unknown period of time, when the black flames were larger than a world, a figure flew over.
 It was a green-robed Daoist. He stood on a wooden sword with his hands behind his back. The green-robed Daoist suddenly stopped and looked at the black flames.
 “What a strong aura of misfortune… Misfortune is invisible and colorless. Why is it condensing here?”?the green-robed Daoist muttered to himself. Raising his right hand to deduce, his face suddenly turned pale.
 The distant black flames suddenly rushed towards the green-robed Daoist at an extremely fast speed. The green-robed Daoist glared as his robes fluttered. A terrifying aura blocked the black flames, causing his speed to decrease.
 “Hmph! Who cares what you are? Since you’re an evil creature, I’ll kill you!” The green-robed Daoist smiled disdainfully.
 Countless vines grew from the wooden sword under his feet and quickly surrounded the black flames. Flowers of different colors grew from the vines.
 Ten thousand flowers bloomed at the same time. Beams of light shot out from the pistil, piercing through the black flames and causing them to be riddled with holes.
 The black flames roared venomously.
 The green-robed Daoist frowned in thought. The black flames suddenly exploded, turning into a black mist that filled the air. Then, it shrank towards the green-robed Daoist at a greater speed.
 The green-robed Daoist waved his hand, and Dharmic powers erupted. It was as if the sun had exploded.
 The scorching Dharmic powers caused the Chaotic Space to boil, but the black mist swept past his Dharmic powers and quickly drowned him.
 In the black mist, the green-robed Daoist panicked. “What’s going on? What power is this? It can actually imprison space!” The green-robed Daoist kept casting spells as he roared in his heart.
 Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 732 years had passed since Han Jue finished cursing He was cultivating when lines of words suddenly appeared in front of him.
 [Detected that you caused the birth of the Curse Fiendcelestial. Because the Curse Fiendcelestial is filled with hatred and jealousy towards you, you have the following choices:]
 [1: Go to the depths of the Chaos immediately and kill the Curse Fiendcelestial to prevent future trouble. You can obtain a Great Dao fragment, a Mystical Power inheritance, and a Creation Spirit Stone.)
 [2: Cultivate in a low-profile manner and stay away from the Curse Fiendcelestial. You can obtain a Great Dao fragment and a Heavenly Dao Spirit Stone.)
 Han Jue was stunned.
 Curse Fiendcelestial?
 What the hell?
 Could it be because he had cursed too many times? Han Jue didn’t make a choice immediately and cautiously used the derivation function. “I want to know how the Book of Misfortune is related to the Curse Fiendcelestial?”
 (100 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [The power of the Book of Misfortune has touched upon a certain Transcendent Rule. The Curse Fiendcelestial itself is the grudge of the Primordial Chaotic Fiendcelestial. It was born because of the fluctuations of the Transcendent Rule. Its mission is to capture you, kill you, and replace you. The Curse Fiendcelestial cannot find you through the Book of Misfortune.)
 So ridiculous!
 “What is the Transcendent Rule?”
 [It involves karma that surpasses the current limits of the system. It cannot be deduced.] Han Jue remained silent. He asked, “Can the Curse Fiendcelestial enter the Heavenly Dao?”
 The second question did not deduct his lifespan. Han Jue asked again, “Can I use the Book of Misfortune to kill him?”
 (100 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [The Book of Misfortune can’t kill the Curse Fiendcelestial. It can only provide the Curse Fiendcelestial with a stronger power.)
 So perverted!
 Han Jue was shocked. “Can the Curse Fiendcelestial kill me now?”
 [Not for the time being.)
 He couldn’t use the Book of Misfortune to curse the Curse Fiendcelestial, and Han Jue couldn’t leave the Heavenly Dao. He could only wait for it to attack.
 Could the supreme power that the Heavenly Dao and the Heavenly Court faced be related to this kind of Transcendent Rule?
 Suddenly thinking of something, Han Jue asked again, “How long will it take for the Curse Fiendcelestial to attack the Heavenly Dao and find trouble with me?”
 (100 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
