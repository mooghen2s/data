 The Extreme Evil Chaotic Devil laughed as they attacked Ten Absolute City. It was world-shattering and unstoppable.
 Zhao Shuangquan, Azure Heaven Mystic, Dao Sovereign, and the other mighty figures went to stop him.
 A figure stood up in Ten Absolute City. His figure was even larger than the entire city. It was the Holy Mother of Order.
 The Order Sacred Light illuminated the murky battlefield. Countless evil devils were reduced to dust, but the Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil and his clone were not affected.
 The Ultimate God of Punishment stepped out of Ten Absolute City and looked at the majestic and terrifying demonic shadow in the distance. He sighed and said, “It’s really unsettling.”
 A blood-stained and tattered armor was attached to his body. His aura changed, startling the mighty figures.
 The leader of the Divine Spirits!
 The mighty figures were very respectful to the Ultimate God of Punishment, but they never knew how strong he was.
 The Ultimate God of Punishment walked forward. With every step, his figure grew taller and his aura soared.
 At the same time, another powerful force that froze all forces descended. It landed on the barren land like the descent of the three thousand Great Dao. The purple pillar of light connected the world and swept away countless evil devils and dust.
 A divine weapon descended from the sky!
 Countless gazes landed on him, and the entire Ten Absolute City was excited.
 Zhao Shuangquan’s expression also became subtle.
 Han Huang!
 The publicly acknowledged strongest in the Chaos!
 Although Zhao Shuangquan had the right to challenge this title, he was still far inferior to Han Huang in the hearts of all living beings.
 Han Huang appeared as a Primordial Fiendcelestial in the purple pillar of light. His white hair fluttered and his purple eyes emitted a terrifying cold light.
 “Hmph!”
 Han Huang snorted coldly, and a spear appeared in his hand. It was the Primordial Divine Spear. It was surrounded by a long dragon condensed from Primordial Purple Qi and roared continuously.
 The Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil looked up upon
 sensing his power.
 “Primordial Fiendcelestial! Hahaha, I want to
 see if you, who call yourself the Primordial
 Fiendcelestial, are qualified!”
 The Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil smiled
 arrogantly, his tone filled with disdain.
 With that, all the evil devils raised their arms.
 Boundless negative karma was absorbed, forming a tornado that wreaked havoc in the
 world. Space was shattered, and even Li Daokong’s Sword Dao River was scattered.
 Boom!
 The three thousand Great Dao trembled and the entire Chaotic Space began to collapse. More and more cracks appeared at the edge. Countless evil devils flew out from the cracks, looking sinister and terrifying as they roared.
 “Noisy!”
 Han Huang waved his palm as he advanced. Divine Might Great Heaven Palm!
 It was invisible and colorless. The billions of evil devils in front of him instantly vanished, including dozens of clones of the Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil.
 Han Huang appeared in front of the largest evil devil. Two Ultimate Origin Soul Oblivions appeared around his body. As he stabbed with his spear, the Great Dao light blade flashed quickly and destroyed all the evil devils in the world.
 The mighty figures along the way felt danger envelop them, but they couldn’t see the speed at which the Ultimate Origin Soul Oblivion
 moved.
 “There’s only the two of us left!”
 Han Huang stared at the Ultimate Evil Chaotic
 Devil and smiled disdainfully.
 The Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil did not panic at
 Han Huang skewered the Ultimate Evil Chaotic
 Devil with his spear. It pulled out a shadow, like the soul body of the Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil was nailed to the Primordial Divine Spear.
 “I’ll destroy your future!”
 Han Huang snorted. The Primordial Divine
 Spear emitted a dazzling purple light and destroyed the Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil
 phantom on the spear shaft.
 Boom-
 The Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil suddenly
 exploded, the terrifying impact tearing everything apart. The array formation protecting Ten Absolute City was instantly destroyed, and everything at the bottom of the
 Chaos was swept away.
 …
 In the third Dao Field.
 Han Jue suddenly felt uneasy. He opened his eyes and saw that the Nine
 Divine Stars and Shan’e were not there. Many disciples gathered outside the Daoist temple. Even the Black Hell Chicken and the Chaotic Heavenly Dog were here. They were discussing the battle of Ten Absolute City.
 Han Jue looked at the bottom of the Chaos. It had already turned to ashes. Countless souls wandered around. All living beings below the Freedom Realm were dead.
 Han Huang, Zhao Shuangquan, the Ultimate
 God of Punishment, the Holy Mother of Order,
 Li Daokong, the Universe Sage King, and the
 other mighty figures were still fighting the Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil. “Hmm?”
 Han Jue raised his eyebrows. He discovered
 that the Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil’s aura had
 changed.
 According to his value, he needed at least 900 trillion years of lifespan!
 This was no longer something that all living beings in the Chaos could resist.
 Han Huang began to borrow the Ultimate Origin Power. Although Han Jue didn’t stop him, Han Huang was not a Dao Creator, after
 “Aren’t the Dao Creators going to make a move?”
 Han Jue was surprised. These Dao Creators were really tolerant.
 The bottom of the Chaos was the closest to the Consciousnessless Great Dao World. The Chaotic Consciousness actually did not react. Perhaps he was hoping that the Ultimate Evil
 Han Jue hesitated. Should he make a move?
 At this rate, Han Huang and the others would not be able to withstand it. Many other disciples were also on the battlefield other than
 his son. Otherwise, he could have used the Invocation Dao to send them all back.
 Han Jue didn’t want to stand out easily.
 At this moment…
 A black vortex appeared in front of him,
 causing him to grow silent.
 At the bottom of the Chaos, ruins filled the air
 and overlapped like mountains.
 The once bustling Ten Absolute City had
 already been razed to the ground. Mighty figures were recuperating one after another.
 The battle in the distance was still ongoing. Zhao Shuangquan and Han Huang joined forces and fought to the death.
 Zhao Xuanyuan looked at the black vortex in front of him in nervous anticipation. Dao Sovereign, Jiang Yi, Han Tuo, Yi Tian, Han
 Qing’er, Han Yunjin, Han Yu, and the other Hidden Sect disciples were also waiting
 expectantly.
 “We can only wait for Master to appear now. Otherwise, we will all die,” Dao Sovereign said in a low voice. His aura was weak. Previously, he used the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority but was still not the Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil’s match. He was even defeated very quickly and miserably.
 Looking around, Han Huang and Zhao Shuangquan were constantly killed and revived. They were not the Ultimate Evil
 Jiang Jueshi’s expression was ugly. “Run?
 Where to? We’re the strongest force in the
 Chaos. What awaits us is also death even if we manage to escape.
 “We can return to Father’s Dao Field!” “What about all living beings?” Jiang Jueshi asked, “We’re all geniuses of the
 Ten Absolutes and are conferred the title of Great Dao Divine Spirit. All living beings believe in us, but should we abandon them in
 front of such a calamity?” Han Tuo, Yi Tian, Dao Sovereign, Han Yunjin,and
 the others had ugly expressions. It was
 fine if Han Qing’er did as she pleased, but they were all responsible. If they really left like this,
 their Dao hearts would definitely be damaged. “Well said!”
 A laugh sounded, startling everyone so much
 that they turned around and saw a figure walk out of the black vortex. It was Han Jue.
 He activated all his Supreme Treasures. Divine
 light flickered, causing everyone to be unable to see his expression. However, everyone felt
 like crying from joy upon seeing him. An unprecedented sense of security enveloped
 them.


 Han Jue’s appearance excited all the nearby Hidden Sect disciples. The vast killing intent that enveloped the world seemed to have vanished.
 The divine light on his body turned into the brightest light in everyone’s eyes. It represented hope and victory.
 Han Jue was invincible in the hearts of the personal disciples of the Hidden Sect.
 Since ancient times, many seemingly
 !!
 irreversible situations seemed calm in front of Han Jue. They no longer doubted him and only looked forward to it.
 “Although you said it well, don’t repeat it next time. If you have the ability, rely on your strength to shoulder your responsibilities!”
 Han Jue’s voice floated over, causing Jiang Jueshi and the others to lower their heads in shame.
 Han Qing’er snorted. “That’s right. All of you are not strong enough and are still pretending to be strong. In the end, you still troubled my father. It’s better to escape back to the Dao Field with me.”
 Facing her mockery, everyone was even more ashamed and did not even dare to reply.
 Lao Dan looked at Han Jue and sighed.
 Han Jue looked into the distance and locked onto the Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil fighting Zhao Shuangquan and his son. He was indeed very strong. An even stronger power hidden in his body was also constantly being released to increase his aura.
 “You’re here.”
 The Ultimate God of Punishment appeared
 beside Han Jue with a low tone.
 Han Jue didn’t look at him and only said softly,
 “You can rest now.’
 The Ultimate God of Punishment said, “I
 suspect that this fellow has already surpassed the Great Dao Supreme Realm and reached a higher realm. You have to be careful.”
 Han Jue didn’t reply.
 He did not attack immediately. Instead, he
 wanted to see Han Huang and Zhao
 Shuangquan’s limits.
 Han Tuo, Han Qing’er, and Han Yunjin
 hurriedly came over.
 “Father, hurry up and attack. I can’t hold on
 much longer.”
 “What are you waiting for?”
 Han Jue was unmoved by his children’s urging.
 More and more mighty figures noticed Han Jue’s appearance. His divine light blocked all prying eyes. Seeing how respectful the Ultimate God of Punishment was, the older generation could guess Han Jue’s identity and felt relieved.
 The new mighty figures were curious. Who was this person?
 At the same time.
 In the third Dao Field.
 “The progenitor has gone there!”
 Shan’e was excited as if he was the one saving the situation.
 The Nine Divine Stars were the same. They were extremely excited. All these years, they had often watched the Chaos, and they had experienced the simulation trial, so they had always looked forward to seeing who was stronger between the ancestor and the Ultimate
 Evil Chaotic Devil.
 Xing Hongxuan smiled. “That fellow is in
 trouble.”
 Xuan Qingjun, Fairy Xi Xuan, Qingluan’er, and Chang Yue’er all smiled and nodded.
 Han Jue never fought battles that he had no
 chance of winning. As long as he was willing to attack, the battle situation would definitely be
 overwhelming.
 Han Huang frantically mobilized the Ultimate
 Origin Power, but it was directly scattered by the Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil every time he wanted to use his Mystical Power. “Damn it… What Mystical Power is this?”
 Han Huang was so angry that his eyes turned
 red.
 He couldn’t see the Ultimate Evil Chaotic
 Devil’s moves at all.
 He felt an extremely terrifying invisible force
 suddenly hit him every time he stood up.
 He was not the only one. Zhao Shuangquan was also extremely angry.
 “Damn it, is this Ninth Brother’s power?”
 Zhao Shuangquan was furious. Was this still the power given to him? Why was it so difficult
 to subdue?
 He couldn’t help but guess. Could it be that his ninth brother had a change of heart?
 The two of them condensed their bodies again
 and attacked the Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil. The moment they moved, they were dispersed
 by an invisible force and destroyed in the alternate space.
 “You worms, do you still want to struggle?”
 The voice of the Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil sounded.
 “You don’t know the meaning of the Chaos at
 all. Your existence is only an accident. I will devour you and let you return to your original path!
 “However, since you want to struggle, I’ll let you feel unprecedented despair!” The Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil’s laughter echoed at the bottom of the Chaos, causing the
 cultivators recuperating to be both angry and terrified.
 Ten Absolute City had been flattened. Countless living beings had died, and they were all cultivators. They were equivalent to the backbone of the Chaos.
 After this battle, it was unknown how long it would take for the Chaos to recover. Han Jue watched for a while and walked over.
 He ascended to the sky step by step as if he was stepping on an invisible staircase.
 All the nearby mighty figures heaved a sigh of
 relief upon seeing that he had finally made a
 move.
 “Huang’er, leave.”
 Just as Han Huang was about to continue, Han Jue’s voice stopped him from flying again. He
 turned around and was stunned.
 “Father…”
 Chaos for nearly 200 million years, he also understood that his father definitely had his own Great Dao World. Zhao Shuangquan also heard Han Jue’s voice and looked over.
 He worshiped the Divine Might Heavenly Sage the most before recovering his origin memories.
 Now that he had regained his memories, as the
 Eighth Chaos, he was very curious about how strong this junior was.
 The Ninth Chaos had instructed him that
 among the current Dao Creators, only Han Jue could threaten him.
 “Who are you?” the Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil
 asked in a low voice as he looked at Han Jue. Filled with killing intent, his red eyes pierced through the rolling mist and landed on Han
 Jue.
 The world was murky. Han Jue and the Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil’s gazes collided.
 All the living beings looked at Han Jue.
 Evil
 The scene seemed to freeze. Han Jue’s figure was not tall. Compared to the Ultimate Chaotic Devil, he was even more tiny.
 Han Jue ignored the Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil. He was getting closer and closer. The Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil became anxious
 and uneasy. He suddenly opened his mouth, and violent negative karma swept through the entire bottom of the Chaos like a black hurricane.
 Han Jue still advanced. The violent negative
 karma couldn’t even break through his Supreme Treasure protective shield. The mighty figures healing were not injured,
 either. They were all protected by Han Jue’s Ultimate Origin Power. This surprised them. “Who is he?”
 “It looks like the Divine Might Heavenly Sage!”
 “Divine Might Heavenly Sage, the legendary
 mighty figure who established the era of geniuses?”
 “So powerful. Why haven’t I heard of him?” “Nonsense. You’re so powerful. Do all the mortals know you?”
 …
 Han Jue seemed to be walking slowly, but he
 arrived in front of the Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil in just a few steps.
 The hurricane formed by negative karma exploded. The Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil took a step back in fear when he saw clearly. With
 his figure, this step brought him billions of
 kilometers away.
 “Who are you?”
 The Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil seemed to be
 Boom-
 The mist in the sky was washed away and a
 black pillar of light descended from the sky, drowning Han Jue.
 Roars of evil devils sounded in the pillar of
 pillar of light and destroyed it. A huge Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal appeared and grew larger and larger, occupying the sky at the bottom of
 the Chaos.
 The Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil had no choice
 but to look up. “This move…”
 Han Huang’s eyelids twitched as he thought of the previous simulation
 trial.
 Zhao Shuangquan was moved. He was shocked
 as he looked at the endless Ultimate Origin
 Heaven Seal.


 The Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal covered the entire bottom of the Chaos the moment it
 appeared. It was equivalent to the entire Chaos. It was enough to shock all the living beings at the bottom of the Chaos.
 From below, the Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal contained countless obscure patterns. The living beings were actually a little stunned as they looked carefully, as if they saw the various forms of all living beings. Countless images entered their eyes. At the same time, reverence rose from the bottom of their hearts.
 It was like a mortal facing an immortal. The reverence was indescribable.
 !!
 The Ultimate Evil Fiend fell into an unprecedented panic upon facing the vast and spectacular Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal.
 “You… what power is this?” the Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil asked with a trembling voice. He already thought that he was invincible, but he felt extremely weak upon facing this power.
 Han Jue’s voice sounded, “Any existence has its meaning, but you have to pay the price if you want to erase other existences.
 “Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil, leave the Chaos. This place doesn’t belong to you.”
 His voice was like thunder, and his divine might was vast. His words were like the constitution of the heavens, deciding the Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil’s fate.
 The Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal suddenly shrank and appeared in front of him before the Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil could react.
 Boom-
 The Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal collided with the Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil and dispersed the evil aura on his body. Countless evil devils rushed out of his body and dissipated into smoke.
 The ground shook and the sky changed!
 The Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal pressed down on the Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil and rushed to the end of the ground, sweeping through the murky world.
 “No-“
 The Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil struggled with all his might, but the Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal contained an extremely strong suction force, firmly sealing him. He couldn’t move, and even his soul could not escape.
 The holy and domineering Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal swept over with the Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil, leaving a point of light for all living beings.
 Under the disbelief of all the mighty figures, the Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal rushed out of the Chaos at an extremely fast speed, pressing the Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil towards the
 blank domain.
 Silence!
 The mighty figures opened their mouths but
 couldn’t say anything. There was only the sound of the thunderous wind.
 Han Jue turned around and glanced at Han Huang. Then, ignoring the disciples, he
 stepped into the black vortex.
 The disciples came back to their senses only
 after the black vortex disappeared.
 The stronger the Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil appeared, the greater the despair they felt. Now, they were even more shocked.
 Han Qing’er sighed. “My father is really
 powerful. Why do I feel that the Ultimate Evil
 Chaotic Devil is nothing much?”
 She naturally teased to ease the atmosphere.
 means that the difference between Master and
 the Chaos has already widened.”
 Dao Sovereign recalled the adventures over the
 years and then thought of Han Jue. He was suddenly confused.
 Not long ago, he was stronger than Han Jue.
 Now, he was left so far behind.
 Could it be that seclusion was the correct path?
 he
 Thinking about it carefully, it had been a long time since he had broken through. Even so, was busy looking for opportunities and his Dao heart could not calm down. It was indeed a
 waste of time.
 Jiang Jueshi smiled. “Don’t think too much. Master’s potential has always been unfathomable. That’s definitely not something that can be achieved through bitter
 cultivation.”
 He reminded them upon seeing the hesitation
 in the hearts of his outstanding fellow
 disciples.
 Jiang Jueshi knew his limits. He knew that he
 Han Jue’s existence didn’t make sense.
 At the same time, the bottom of the Chaos
 cheered.
 “We won! The Chaos won!”
 “As expected of the Divine Might Heavenly
 Sage!” “Why can’t I remember his figure clearly?” “It’s said that there are some unknown existences in the Chaos. Could the Divine Might Heavenly Sage be such an existence?”
 “The Divine Might Heavenly Sage did not make
 an appearance since the first Chaotic Assembly. It seems that he really doesn’t care about it
 anymore.
 “I wonder if that Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil
 …
 Han Jue sat on the lotus throne and looked at
 the blank domain after returning to the third
 Dao Field.
 The Chaotic Consciousness and the Immeasurable Destruction Venerable attacked.
 They joined forces to send the Ultimate Evil
 These Dao Creators did not go back on their
 word. They knew the situation and would be stupid not to use such a good opportunity. Shan’e and the Nine Divine Stars entered the temple. They looked at him in admiration. Han Zongdao suppressed his excitement and asked, “Progenitor, how much strength did you use to deal with the Ultimate Evil Chaotic
 Devil?”
 Han Jue smiled. “Of course, I did my best.”
 “Impossible! I think you’re very relaxed!”
 Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil can’t withstand a single blow from you. Is he dead?” Han Jue said, “He’s not dead. He’s just expelled. He’s really strong and can’t be killed.
 His body contains a power that can destroy the Chaos. It’s precisely because of this that we transcendent existences don’t dare to rashly attack. Once we’re forced to a corner, that power will erupt and the entire Chaos will cease to exist.”
 The Nine Divine Stars looked at each other, feeling even more reverence for the Chaos. They originally thought that they could already see through the Chaos, but they did not expect
 there to be many existences they did not know. Han Xuan’ao said, “Progenitor, tell us your story again? We want to know how you became so powerful.”
 The other descendants nodded desperately and stared at him expectantly.
 Han Jue smiled benevolently. “Then tell me. The last time I talked about the Ancient Desolate, I started from the conflict between
 the Ancient Desolate and the Heavenly Dao…”
 As Han Jue talked about the past, the tragedy at the bottom of the Chaos began to spread. Too many cultivators had died in this battle. It covered the various factions of the Chaos, including the other Great Dao World domains.
 This battle made the mighty figures of the
 Great Dao World realize that they were not strong enough. They didn’t have the right to dominate the Chaos.
 The Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil’s existence also traumatized them. After all, he did not die, he had only been expelled. Time passed slowly.
 Han Jue became 220 million years old and
 obtained another Creation Heaven’s Chosen
 attempt.
 Peace had returned to the Chaos after millions
 of years. However, Han Jue’s Dao Field became lively.
 Dao Sovereign, Zhao Xuanyuan, Jiang Yi, Han Tuo, Han Yunjin, and the other personal disciples and sons arrived. They all wanted to accept Han Jue’s teachings
 again, but he was in seclusion. They could only wait in the Dao Field.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and didn’t go out. Instead, he started to check his emails. [Your good friend, the Formless Transcendent
 a
 Deity, was cursed by a mysterious curse.] [Your good friend Huang Zuntian suffered backlash from a mysterious mighty figure. His soul was damaged.]
 [Your disciple Su Qi spread bad luck, causing a
 world to collapse and reincarnation to be destroyed.]
 [Your son Han Huang was attacked by a Chaotic
 Evil Devil] x89827763
 [Your good friend, the Ultimate God of
 Punishment, was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure.]
 [Your good friend, the Holy Mother of Order, received a dream from a transcendent
 existence.]
 [Your good friend Zhao Shuangquan received a
 dream from your enemy, the Ninth Chaos. His
 cultivation has increased.]


 Compared to the past, the frequency of evil devils appearing had greatly decreased. However, the number of transcendent existences had increased greatly.
 It seemed that the Dao Creators had begun to take action.
 Han Jue thought silently as he read the emails.
 It was unknown what the Ninth Chaos was thinking after he repelled the Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil.
 Be it using the Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil to kill the Dao Creator or using it to fulfill Zhao Shuangquan’s wish, it was very difficult to realize his intention now.
 Han Jue didn’t go out and continued his seclusion after reading the emails.
 The Chaos was in the midst of a revival. Evil devils were still wandering around. The various factions were nurturing new core forces.
 Ancient Primordial World.
  Huang Zuntian curled up in the endless purple Qi. His soul was wrapped by chains formed by purple symbols and could not move.
 A blurry figure appeared in front of him. It was Primordial Origin.
 Primordial Origin looked at him and asked, “The Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil has been
 expelled from the Chaos. Guess who did it?” “Han Huang?”
 What else could he do?
 Primordial Origin said, “Han Huang’s father, the Divine Might Heavenly Sage. The Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil who suppressed the entire Chaos was helpless in front of him.”
 Huang Zuntian was silent.
 Primordial Origin said, “Fortunately, I’m not arrogant. If I go out early, I’m afraid I won’t be able to escape death. We should enter seclusion in the Ancient Primordial World. I’ll return your body when we truly surpass the Great Dao Supreme Realm.”
 Huang Zuntian smiled. “Are you returning my body or a new one?”
 “It’s the same. You wouldn’t be here today if
 not for me. You should repay me.’
 “But you’re too ambitious. You don’t just want
 “Hmph. I naturally have to create the
 Primordial Chaos if I’m the Primordial
 Fiendcelestial. The prerequisite for creating the Primordial Chaos is to destroy the Chaos, just like how the Chaos replaced the Primordial Chaos. Therefore, on this point, I’m the true Primordial Fiendcelestial, and that Han Huang is only a thief. He doesn’t have the Primordial Fiendcelestial’s ambitions.”
 Huang Zuntian fell silent again.
 He knew that he couldn’t convince Primordial Origin. This fellow had already lost his mind.
 However, sometimes, thinking about Primordial Origin’s words, they were not
 unreasonable. If the Chaos could replace the
 Primordial Chaos, why couldn’t the Primordial
 Chaos counterattack?
 Perhaps because he was a Chaotic lifeform, he had an innate sense of distance from the
 Primordial Chaos.
 Primordial Origin vanished, leaving behind a
 sentence.
 “The Divine Might Heavenly Sage will be my greatest enemy when I create the Primordial Chaos. I will use him as my target to cultivate.”
 Huang Zuntian did not reply, but his heart was filled with disdain.
 It’s impossible for you to catch up to Master no matter how much you cultivate.
 I have to think of a way. Although I’m suppressed, the nebulous Primordial Qi here can nourish my soul. Perhaps this is also an
 In the third Dao Field.
 Dao Sovereign, Jiang Yi, Zhao Xuanyuan, Han
 Tuo, Yi Tian, the Black Hell Chicken, Yang Tiandong, Murong Qi, and so on gathered here. Most of the personal disciples of the Hidden
 Sect were here.
 With the agreement of Han Jue’s clone, the other three Divine Punishers under Han Tuo also entered the Dao Field.
 They all underwent Absolute Purification the moment they entered.
 body. The third Dao Field had never been so lively. Shan’e and the Nine Divine Stars also appeared to receive their seniors.
 The personal disciples didn’t dare to underestimate these ten juniors cultivating beside Han Jue. To be chosen by him, they were definitely geniuses among geniuses. “Han Tuo, why do I feel that their potential is
 not inferior to ours?” Yi Tian winked and asked
 with a smile.
 Han Tuo said disapprovingly, “Father had just attained the Dao when he gave birth to me.
 What cultivation level was he at when he gave birth to Han Yunjin? His potential will naturally only be higher than mine.”
 Most of the descendants of the Han family
 descended from Han Yunjin. Han Jue had five
 children. Han Tuo, Han Huang, Han Qing’er, and Han Ling were all busy cultivating. Only Han Yunjin did not think much of cultivation and helped the Han family expand.
 This time, Han Yunjin came back to cultivate
 because he wanted to visit his mother, Li Yao. Han Jue and Li Yao were both ascetics, but they
 gave birth to a carefree son like him. It was shocking.
 The personal disciples reminisced about the
 past. After a long time, Jiang Yi suddenly suggested
 sparring in the simulation trial. The disciples
 agreed, so they began to spar in groups. Time passed.
 Another ten million years passed. Han Jue’s Creation Heaven’s Chosen accumulated nine more times, but he had no intention of using them.
 experience had never fallen behind.
 Han Jue first checked his emails. His circle of friends became much quieter after
 the personal disciples returned.
 Han Jue stood up and walked out of the Daoist temple after reading the emails.
 The disciples were all cultivating and it was
 The disciples of the second Dao Field and the
 main Dao Field could hear it. There were more than a hundred million disciples in the Hundred Peak Immortal River. Everyone in the
 Hundred Peak Immortal River seemed to have lost their voices and instantly fell silent. The lecture ended five thousand years later.
 Han Jue and the women chatted in the Daoist temple to resolve their cultivation problems. They benefited greatly from a few of his words.
 Xing Hongxuan said, “Husband, I’ve been having a dream recently. It keeps repeating.” Han Jue smiled and asked, “What dream?” It was strange that they could still dream at
 their cultivation level.
 Xing Hongxuan hesitated.
 “Tell me,” Han Jue urged. Qingluan’er, Xuan Qingjun, Fairy Xi Xuan, Li Yao, Dao Comprehension Sword, and Chang Yue’er looked at her in surprise, curious about the dream.
 Xing Hongxuan said, “I dreamed of another you repeating your life in the mortal world.”
 Han Jue raised his eyebrows and asked, “Be more detailed.”
 “That’s right. I saw a youth born in the mortal world. He’s also from the Jade Pure Sect and has experienced the same thing as you. He’s constantly growing, but I can’t see his true appearance. However, his actions are different from yours. Although it’s the same experience,
 Han Jue asked in his mind, “Who was Xing Hongxuan dreaming of?” [Unable to derive this karma. Perhaps there is
 no such karma. Perhaps the other party has an
 Ultimate Dao Treasure.]
 What the heck? Were there so many Ultimate Dao Treasures?
 Han Jue said, “Show us your dream.”


 Xing Hongxuan waved her sleeve and cast a spell. A screen of light appeared in front of everyone and began to show her dream.
 In the dream, a youth rode his sword forward. In front of him was a peerless demon trampling on a ruined city filled with smoke. The wails and screams of countless people resounded through the sky.
 The youth wore white clothes. He raised his hand and pointed. It was actually the Heaven Earth Mystic Yellow World Piercing Sword Finger. Sword Qi followed the tip of his finger and shot out. From ten thousand miles away, it pierced through the head of the unparalleled demon, causing blood to splatter through the yellow sky.
 Han Jue had a strange expression.
 It had to be said that this youth indeed had his taste.
 “Strange, nothing like this is happening in the Heavenly Dao.”
 Chang Yue’er counted with her fingers. The situation in the Heavenly Dao did not match the scene in the dream.
 There were many Jade Pure Sects in the
  but
 they could not deduce it at all.
 Fairy Xi Xuan stared at the dream and said,
 “Perhaps it isn’t happening now.”
 The women continued to watch.
 That was a good idea.
 Xing Hongxuan’s eyes lit up. “Huang’er will marry and have children?”
 Han Huang had a heart of stone. All these years, there had been no woman around him. He seemed to look down on women.
 Only Han Jue knew that Han Huang felt that he was not from the same race as all living beings, so he didn’t marry.
 It was just like how it was very difficult for a person to marry chickens and dogs. Even if they were all the same after transforming, the pride in Han Huang’s bones did not allow him to do that.
 “Perhaps. Who can predict marriage?”
 Han Jue smiled and stood up. Then, he left the Daoist temple, leaving the women to discuss curiously.
 Women were all gossipy. They were all curious about what kind of woman Han Huang would
 marry.
 On the other side.
 Transcendent Domain, Creation Emperor
 Court.
 In the dark hall, faint white flames burned at the edge. Thunderclouds appeared in the sky. Han Huang sat in a mysterious pool. Beside him stood the Primordial Divine Spear. Purple dragons wrapped around it and were nourished by the water.
 Footsteps sounded and Han Ling, who was
 wearing a graceful golden dress, walked over. She wore a phoenix crown and a mysterious jade stone hung on her forehead. It emitted a dazzling light and covered her peerless appearance. Behind her long dress floated a row of Emperor Soldier shadows. They were like guards and were inseparable from her.
 Han Ling sighed softly. “That Ultimate Evil
 Chaotic Devil is indeed powerful. Even if ten of me help you, I’m not his match. It’s mainly the difference in cultivation realm.”
 “But how long has it been since the Ultimate
 Evil Chaotic Devil’s birth?”
 “His background shouldn’t be that simple. Even Father can only expel him.”
 “No matter what his background is, he’s still
 stronger than us. This is the truth. We have to work hard to surpass him!”
 Han Huang spoke firmly. Han Ling could only
 sigh again.
 Han Ling turned around and left, leaving behind a sentence: “Second Brother, your focus
 Han Huang opened his eyes and looked at her
 back, frowning.
 He did not refute but fell into deep thought.
 Chaos, Nine Extremes Orthodoxy.
 Zhao Shuangquan, the Nine-Headed Divine
 Spirit, and Yu Yuan meditated facing each other. Yu Yuan saw Zhao Shuangquan’s ugly expression and asked, “Dao Lord, what do you want to say?”
 Yuan’s true identity. He was the successor of
 the First Chaos’ will and would be possessed by the First Chaos sooner or later. However, he had to hide this truth. For this, he nurtured Yu Yuan vigorously and let him receive treatment that far exceeded what he had received in the
 Creation Emperor Court. “The Nine Extremes Orthodoxy lacks top mighty figures the most. I remember an
 existence who was the previous leader of the Divine Spirits. His name is the Primordial Ancestor God, and he has strength that’s not
 inferior to the Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil.” The Nine-Headed Divine Spirit smiled leisurely. Zhao Shuangquan raised his eyebrows. “Where
 is he?” “He was cursed by the Dark Forbidden Lord
 and only has a wisp of his will left. He’s still in the blank domain. I’ll think of a way to revive him. He was once my right-hand man and will listen to me.”
 “Oh? You were so powerful in the past?”
 “Cough cough, I once controlled the Chaos.” “Then why are you in such a situation?” Zhao Shuangquan and Yu Yuan looked at the Nine-Headed Divine Spirit in confusion. The Nine-Headed Divine Spirit was embarrassed and did not answer.
 Zhao Shuangquan narrowed his eyes and asked, “Who is it?”
 The Nine-Headed Divine Spirit said, “Divine
 Might… However, this is in the past. I was careless back then.”
 Zhao Shuangquan did not ask further. After
 seeing the scene of the Divine Might Heavenly Sage suppressing the Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil, he knew that the Nine-Headed Divine Spirit’s defeat was not in vain.
 Yu Yuan did not interrupt. It was unknown what he was thinking. “One is not enough. What I want is strength
 The Nine-Headed Divine Spirit looked bitter. Brat, do you really think there are many existences like the Primordial Ancestor God?
 If not for the Divine Might Heavenly Sage’s appearance, the Primordial Ancestor God would be considered an invincible existence in the
 Chaos.
 even curse the Primordial Ancestor God to
 death?” Yu Yuan asked. The Nine-Headed Divine Spirit rolled his eyes. “How mysterious is the Dark Forbidden Lord? Even Divine Might was cursed by him. You want to subdue him?”
 Yu Yuan said, “The Dark Forbidden Lord
 doesn’t dare to show himself. He must be
 afraid. He might be more confident if we join forces with him.”
 “That’s easy to say. How can we rope him in?” “The Nine Extremes Orthodoxy can directly believe in the Dark Forbidden Lord and wait for
 him to take the initiative to contact us. We can also recruit the Dark Forbidden Lord’s believers. As for the negative effects, we can
 fabricate his legend and beautify him. There aren’t many people who truly hate the Dark Forbidden Lord in this era.” Zhao Shuangquan’s eyes light up.
