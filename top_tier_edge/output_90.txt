 In the dark void of the myriad worlds.
 Countless illusions bloomed like epiphyllum. They grew from nothing to big and dissipated like fireworks.
 Han Huang was among them. Two different rainbow lights wrapped around his body like two souls. He could vaguely see a human figure.
 He slowly opened his eyes and frowned.
 “Why can’t they fuse?” Han Huang muttered to himself, his heart filled with doubts.
 His cultivation level could no longer increase. He could only think of another way.
 He had also established his own world in the depths of his soul. However, it would take too long to develop into a Great Dao World. It’d take so long that he felt that it was almost impossible.
 The time needed to develop from the soul world to the scale of Shi Tian and the Chaos was not as simple as seas withering and stones rotting.
 Han Huang thought of the mysterious power hidden in his bloodline. Could he fuse with the two Supreme Rules if he relied on that power?
 He immediately tried.
 Soon, he obtained a trace of the Ultimate Origin Power. Something pleasantly
 surprising happened. The two Supreme Rules began to fuse under the Ultimate Origin Power’s pressure. Although it was very slow, it did exist.
 “Indeed, there are no rules I can’t subdue!”
 Han Huang smiled and began to enjoy the process of fusing the Supreme Rules.
 At this moment, the Ultimate Origin Power suddenly stopped, stunning him.
 He discovered that no matter how he
 mobilized it, he could not summon that
 Han Huang panicked.
 Could it be that his mysterious power had been devoured by the Supreme Rules?
 Impossible!
 That power was invincible!
 Han Huang calmed down and continued to try.
 Several hundred years later, he finally sensed the mysterious power again. This time, the mysterious power no longer disappeared when he fused with the Supreme Rules.
 he understood something.
 He couldn’t lose himself if he couldn’t
 Wouldn’t he be finished if this power
 suddenly disappeared in a battle to the death in the future?
 Han Huang suddenly felt a lingering fear.
 Could this power be a trap?
 This possibility was not low!
 Han Huang thought of countless possibilities. There were the enemy’s schemes, his father’s favor, and so on. However, in the end, he could only decide not to use this power easily in the future.
 …
 [Detected that you are 90 million years old
 and your life has taken another step forward. You have the following choices:]
 [1: Exit seclusion immediately and help the Ultimate Origin World devour other Great Dao Worlds. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment,
 a Primordial Fragment, a Creation Spirit Stone, and a chance to upgrade the system function.]
 Han Jue opened his eyes and silently chose the second option.
 Although the opportunity to upgrade the
 system function was precious, it would attract countless troubles.
 Han Jue didn’t want to make enemies for now.
 His cultivation level had increased greatly again after millions of years. His understanding of the Ultimate Origin
 With the forced help of the Transcendent, Consciousnessless, and Shi Tian Great Dao Worlds, the Chaos’ development speed far exceeded that of before.
 From the Chaos, one could tell the situation of
 the Ninth Chaos.
 Han Jue looked at Shan’e and followed him to the Daoist temple of the Hundred Peak Immortal River alone. He took out the Book of
 Misfortune and started cursing the Ninth
 Chaos.
 No one could see this action, not even his woman and children!
 If he chased away Shan’e, he was afraid that it
 would lead to problems, so it was best to hide and do it quietly.
 A familiar touch caused Han Jue to smile.
 Sigh.
 Even as a Dao Creator, I’m still so sinister.
 Although it was shameless, it was really satisfying.
 Han Jue began to curse with all his might and checked his attributes panel. Although he no longer needed to care about his lifespan, he
 felt that he still had to be cautious to prevent himself from going overboard.
 He would exhaust it one day no matter how
 much lifespan he had.
 Five days later, Han Jue’s lifespan began to decrease rapidly.
 In the end, Han Jue consumed 1 quadrillion years of his lifespan. He put down the Book of Misfortune after cursing the Ninth Chaos until his Dao heart was in chaos.
 He only wanted to delay the Ninth Chaos and
 not curse him to death.
 If the Ninth Chaos died, all living beings in
 the Chaos and the Heavenly Dao would be destroyed.
 There was no need to do that. Han Jue still yearned for peace.
 He would not suppress all living beings or other cultivators if he was invincible. He put away the Book of Misfortune and returned to the third Dao Field. Shan’e had already woken up and wasn’t cultivating anymore. Seeing him, he immediately stood up and asked, “Progenitor, where did you go?”
 “Hmm?”
 Han Jue raised his eyebrows.
 Shan’e trembled in fear and hurriedly said,
 “I’m just worried that you…
 ||
 I’m getting arrogant! How dare I question the progenitor!
 “I went to see my disciples. I have countless
 such Dao Field and have nurtured countless disciples,” Han Jue sat down and replied casually.
 Shan’e felt deep veneration. He added, “Progenitor, I discovered a
 terrifying figure when I was studying the
 curse. The Dark Forbidden Lord is very likely at the end of karma. It’s too terrifying. Just looking at his back is enough to make me fear and kneel.”
 Hearing this, Han Jue asked curiously, “What does it look like?”
 Shan’e waved his hands and revealed what he saw.
 Han Jue saw a black shadow appear in the illusion. It was as if his back was facing the
 sun. He couldn’t see his true appearance, but his figure was extremely blurry.
 It was not him and had nothing to do with his
 descendants and disciples.
 He began to deduce and discovered that he could not.
 Han Jue was interested.
 “I want to know who the black shadow that
 Shan’e saw is?”
 [You can’t detect this karma. It might not
 exist or have an Ultimate Dao Treasure.]
 “Is there a second Book of Misfortune?” [Unable to detect the karma.]
 Han Jue tried asking in other ways but to no avail.
 This was interesting!
 He could even deduce the Ninth Chaos. There
 was actually something more mysterious than it.
 He asked who the strongest person was again. After deducting 10 quadrillion years of his
 lifespan, he learned that it was still the Ninth Chaos.
 Could it be that this person came from the future? Han Jue fell into deep thought. Shan’e still described the pressure he felt at
 that time. “The other party didn’t sense you?” Han Jue asked.
 Shan’e shook his head. “Probably not. In any case, I was so frightened when I saw him that
 I retracted my will and didn’t dare to peek anymore.’
 Han Jue said, “It’s fine. Continue. This is your path.”
 He would use Absolute Purification to help Shan’e if something happened. He had already extracted a wisp of Shan’e’s
 soul to facilitate revival, so it could be said to
 be foolproof. There was no need to worry. “Yes, yes…”
 Shan’e nodded and hesitated. Han Jue started to check his emails.
 Seeing that the progenitor was ignoring him, Shan’e immediately said, “Progenitor, I’ve attained the Great Dao!”


 “Oh? Not bad,” Han Jue responded and praised.
 Shan’e was depressed. “Progenitor, I’m a Great Dao Sage! Those seniors told me that I have already reached the peak of the Chaos when I passed the door of the Great Dao!”
 Han Jue smiled. “That’s the peak of the Chaos. It’s not my expectations for you, understand?”
 Shan’e was stunned. “Isn’t the Great Dao Sage Realm enough?”
 Han Jue said, “To the Chaos, it’s indeed enough. But not to me. I have many Great Dao Sages under me. There are even many existences that surpass the Great Dao Sage Realm.”
 Shan’e was stunned.
 He knew that the progenitor was very strong, but he didn’t know that he was the Divine
 Might Heavenly Sage.
 Apart from the people Han Jue specially
 treated, all living beings had already
 forgotten his name and only knew the Divine
 Might Heavenly Sage.
 Shan’e came from the lower realm, so he naturally didn’t know that the Divine Might Heavenly Sage was Han Jue.
 The personal disciples Han Jue had brought him to see before didn’t mention this, either. They felt that it was natural and there was naturally no need to forcefully mention it.
 Han Jue smiled. “Do you want to enter a simulation trial with me?”
 Shan’e instantly smiled. “Alright! Progenitor! I’ll surprise you!”
 Without another word, Han Jue immediately pulled him into the simulation trial.
 A breath later, Shan’e opened his eyes. He was in a daze. His body trembled and his face was filled with fear.
 Han Jue continued to check his emails.
 After a long while…
 after he finished reading all the emails.
 Han Jue frowned. Was he too ruthless?
 He immediately said, “Shan’e?”
 His voice was like a thunderclap, recalling in
 the mind of Shan’e, waking him up.
 Shan’e came back to his senses and sat on the
 ground. His bearing was not of a Great Dao
 Sage but similar to a mortal.
 Han Jue snorted. “Is that all you’ve got? I thought you were strong. Stop posturing.” Shan’e didn’t know what posturing was, but it
 was probably bragging.
 He lowered his head in shame. The previous battle was like a nightmare that could not go
 Han Jue said, “Cultivate well and don’t slack off. You’re still far from it. As long as someone is stronger than you, what happened to you when you were young might happen again. Do you understand?”
 Shan’e paled as he hurriedly nodded.
 He immediately teleported to the main Dao
 Field.
 Shan’e heaved a sigh of relief and smiled
 bitterly.
 “Shan’e, Shan’e. You’re ridiculous. How dare
 you challenge the progenitor?”
 Shan’e was filled with regret.
 Half a day later.
 Han Jue fetched Fairy Xi Xuan and Chang
 Yue’er.
 Xing Hongxuan took the initiative to
 entertain them and talked about the past of
 the Jade Pure Sacred Sect. The three women
 sighed.
 Han Jue left and didn’t disturb them from
 catching up. If Chang Yue’er wanted to go out and wander around, a clone in the Dao Field would send her out.
 The universe of stars outside the third Dao
 Field was already extremely abundant. There
 were all sorts of cultivation systems and civilizations. If she was bored, Chang Yue’er could go and play. Her life would not be in
 danger. After all, this was Liu Bei’s jurisdiction.
 Thinking of the universe of stars, Han Jue
 thought of Hong Jun, who had acknowledged Liu Bei as his master.
 Hong Jun had already left for tens of millions
 of years and had not been heard from since. Han Jue sat on the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus and began to deduce him. He discovered that Hong Jun was not in the Chaos but had arrived at the Transcendent Great Dao World. He had preached for ten million years and created his
 own lineage. He was clearly walking the path of the Dao Ancestor.
 Han Jue naturally wouldn’t interfere in Hong
 Jun’s actions. Since ancient times, the Dao Ancestor had never schemed against him and even tacitly agreed to give him the Heavenly Dao. The two of them helped each other and
 Han Jue watched for a while and suddenly saw
 Han Huang.
 Han Huang was transcending the Great Dao
 World and fighting for another Supreme Rule.
 He had just succeeded!
 Was he gathering the Supreme Rules of the
 various worlds?
 Interesting.
 Han Jue could see that the Primordial World
 had already been established in the depths of Han Huang’s soul. Han Jue grew nostalgic after seeing that familiar scene. Primordial Chaos was enough for Han Huang
 to develop for countless years.
 Han Jue wouldn’t stay in the Ultimate Origin World. Other than constantly raising his cultivation realm, even his physique had to constantly transform. He would leave the other Dao Creators far behind and form an arbitrary advantage.
 Han Jue didn’t want to restrain Han Huang
 but let him cause trouble.
 He had long accepted a wisp of Han Huang’s
 soul to facilitate his revival. He believed that his son also had his own methods. However, only the soul fragment in the Dao
 Field could help him revive if he angered a Dao Creator.
 Then, Han Jue closed his eyes and continued
 cultivating.
 Shan’e also adjusted his state of mind and meditated again. His gaze on Han Jue became
 firm.
 “Progenitor, just you wait. I won’t disappoint
 you!” Shan’e swore in his heart that he could not lose face anymore.
 Creation Emperor Court, Heavenly Hall.
 Han Ling sat on a high seat with a dignified posture. Her gaze landed on the eight people
 in the hall.
 Han Ye, Han Yao, and Han Bashen were all
 here, as well as the other five Great Dao Sages.
 “My ancestor Han Huang is too strong. I can’t snatch him at all. Why don’t we find the Supreme Rules of the Consciousnessless Great Dao World?”
 Han Yao suggested helplessly.
 Han Ye snorted, but he did not refute. Han Huang’s strength almost traumatized him. There was indeed no need to fight to the
 death.
 Han Bashen smiled and said, “I think that
 Supreme Rules are useless other than causing trouble.”
 Han Ling said, “This trip doesn’t mean that you must obtain the Supreme Rules. I just want you to get used to it and sense the top strength of the Chaos. After this battle, you
 Court
 should be able to put away the arrogance in your hearts. Next, the Creation Emperor plans to recruit cultivators, especially Freedom Sages. The more, the better.
 “Han Yao, lead the five Dao Emperors to the netherworld. I want to establish a force there. You have to gain a foothold no matter what
 method you use.” Han Yao immediately cupped his hands and accepted the order. Then, he left with the five
 Great Dao Sages.
 Han Ye and Han Bashen were also about to leave when Han Ling stopped them.
 After Han Yao and the other three disappeared, Han Ling said, “I’m preparing to open up our Great Dao World in the netherworld. What do you think?” Han Ye was stunned. “In the netherworld?” “The netherworld separates the living and the dead, but it’s difficult for a Sage to appear there, so it’s ignored by the living world. I think that the netherworld is feasible. The netherworlds of the various Great Dao Worlds are connected. I feel that there’s a mystery
 hidden here. I’ll leave the matter of recruiting Freedom Sages to you. You can use your other identities and infiltrate the netherworld. Don’t tell Han Yao.”
 Han Ling instructed. She raised her right
 hand and waved it gently. Two Emperor Soldier shadows landed on Han Ye and Han Bashen. Immediately after, they covered them and transformed into Emperor Soldiers.
 Han Ye sized himself up and clicked his tongue in wonder.
 Han Bashen asked curiously, “Your Majesty, what should we do when we go to the
 netherworld?”
 Han Ling’s expression did not change as she
 said, “I’m looking for a treasure called the Ultimate Origin Cultivation Potential. It’s hidden in the Yellow Spring. I don’t know where it is, but I’ve deduced that by obtaining the Ultimate Origin Power, one can obtain
 supreme creation.”


 Five million years later, a violent fluctuation appeared at the edge of the Ultimate Origin World in the blank domain. Fortunately, there were no living beings nearby and no one sensed it.
 The living beings in the Ultimate Origin World had yet to gain the ability to sense the situation outside.
 The reason for all of this was naturally because Han Jue’s cultivation had improved again.
 The trip to Shi Tian had given him a lot of inspiration. His cultivation progress was actually faster than before.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and looked satisfied.
 The late stage of the Dao Creator Realm was still far away, but not that far away.
 He looked at Shan’e beside him. He was still cultivating.
 After this kid was stimulated, his cultivation state was clearly more serious. Han Jue was very satisfied.
 “The next Chaotic Assembly is about to begin. Should I let him participate?”
 Han Jue thought about it and hesitated for a moment before deciding to give up.
 It was better for this kid to stay here. There was no need for all his impressive
 descendants to shine.
 Han Jue started to check his emails.
 In the past few years, the most active were the Creation Emperor Court and the Life faction. Han Huang was busy fusing the Supreme Rules and had not received any news recently.
 Without Han Huang, the Chaos and Shi Tian were even more lively.
 The dark clouds above their heads dissipated before they dared to act boldly.
 Han Jue felt that something related to him had been moved when he was in the middle of cultivation. Because it didn’t affect him much, he didn’t care and had the time to deduce.
 “Eh?!” Han Jue suddenly exclaimed. He discovered something strange.
 The netherworld of the Ultimate Origin World
 actually fused with the netherworld of the
 various Great Dao Worlds, forming an
 independent plane. At first glance, the
 netherworld was larger than any world
 because the Great Dao Worlds had yet to fuse
 together.
 Someone had already infiltrated the Ultimate Origin World through the Chaotic
 Netherworld.
 How strange. No living being had established
 the netherworld in the Ultimate Origin World. Could the netherworld have its own rules?
 Back then, Empress Houtu had only established the cycle of reincarnation and led the Heavenly Dao into the netherworld?
 The ones who infiltrated the netherworld of
 the Ultimate Origin World were Han Ye and Han Bashen. No wonder Han Jue felt that it didn’t affect him much. If it was an unknown aura, with his instincts, he would definitely feel disgusted. A trace of disgust from a Dao Creator was enough to crush a Great Dao Sage.
 It turned out that the cultivation potential formed by the Ultimate Origin Power had been born in the netherworld of the Ultimate Origin World. There were only two currently, and one of them had been snatched away by
 Han Ye and Han Bashen.
 The so-called Ultimate Origin Cultivation Potential was only formed by the settling of the Ultimate Origin Power. It was nothing.
 Of course, this power was definitely unfathomable to the Great Dao. Even someone as strong as Han Huang was obsessed.
 However, how did these two brats find the Ultimate Origin Cultivation Potential? Han Jue continued to deduce and discovered that the source of this karma was Han Ling.
 Han Ling could actually deduce the Ultimate Origin Cultivation Potential. As expected of a bloodline relative. However, he didn’t know if Han Ling had guessed that it was related to
 him. After understanding it, Han Jue didn’t care anymore. He stretched lazily and relaxed his
 body.
 Shan’e opened his eyes. “Progenitor, you’re
 awake.”
 His tone was respectful. It was different from
 the past, making Han Jue a little helpless. Could it be that the previous suppression was
 too much?
 “I can preach the Dao to you and help you.”
 Han Jue left a clone to preach the Dao while
 his main body went to visit his Dao
 Companions.
 A thousand years later.
 Han Jue finished his lecture and Shan’e woke
 up.
 Shan’e sighed. “Progenitor is indeed the progenitor. Your lecture surpassed my ten million years of cultivation. Furthermore, it
 gave me a deeper understanding of the future
 cultivation path.”
 Han Jue said, “No matter what, you have to always maintain a humble and cautious heart. Let me tell you about my past.’
 Shan’e immediately became interested. He sat in front of Han Jue and waited expectantly.
 Han Jue started from when he was young. He had said this many times to different people, but every time he said it, it would not cause
 annoyance. At the same time, this was also for himself to hear.
 He must never forget how he survived back then.
 Previously, the system had already let him see
 how the people who had grasped the system
 in the past died. Some were as cautious as him, but after feeling invincible, they began to relax and were still doomed.
 Soon, Shan’e was entranced, as if he was in Han Jue’s shoes and facing those dangers. Although the progenitor was too cautious and even a little timid and unreasonable, he would still help when the people around him encountered a calamity.
 Shan’e felt that this was the person he wanted
 After Han Jue finished speaking, Shan’e said respectfully, “Progenitor, I understand your intentions.”
 Han Jue smiled. “Go curse someone now. His name is Han Fenjue. He looks like this.” He waved his hand and a figure that looked
 like him appeared. Han Fenjue was a soul fragment he had
 thrown into the mortal world a thousand years ago. Under his deliberate suppression, Han Fenjue only had the cultivation of a Great Dao Supreme, but he had lost his memories and did not know good or evil. Shan’e was stunned. He was not stupid. He
 knew at a glance that the other party was related to the progenitor.
 He took a deep breath and began to activate the power of the Curse Origin Star.
 The curse power activated!
 Han Jue showed a frown.
 Why was there a delay?
 Could it be because Han Fenjue was too
 strong?
 Another few days passed. Shan’e’s face turned pale and his body began to tremble.
 It was the backlash from Han Fenjue. Han Jue immediately took back Han Fenjue’s
 soul fragment and memories surged into his mind.
 Han Fenjue did not deduce whether it was
 good or evil. He could only follow the curse and trigger a backlash.
 Han Jue looked at Shan’e in surprise. Could this kid really be like the Book of Misfortune?
 It seemed that the Curse Origin Star was deeply affected by the Book of Misfortune. The Book of Misfortune would consume his origin lifespan, but what about Shan’e?
 “Progenitor… My cultivation level has fallen…”
Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m Shan’e was terrified, his tone filled with uneasiness.
 Cursing consumed cultivation?
 Han Jue thought for a moment. That made
 sense.
 He consoled him. “It’s fine. Just cultivate
 again. How much did you lose? If you go out
 and train, how much cultivation will you lose when you encounter enemies?”
 Shan’e felt that it made sense, and his expression softened.
 Han Jue smiled as he stared at him.
 This kid would be his secret weapon. Not bad!
 Han Jue asked, “You will walk on the path of
 cursing in the future. Have you thought of a
 new name? Just like the Dark Forbidden Lord. No one knows his true identity.’ Shan’e’s eyes lit up. He thought for a moment
 and said, “I’ll be called the Forbidden Lord of Misfortune. How about that?”
 “It’s alright. It’s different from the Dark Forbidden Lord, but from the name, it makes people feel that you’re related to him. At that
 time, the Dark Forbidden Lord can help you share the pressure.”
 “Yes, Progenitor. Don’t worry. I’ll surpass the
 Dark Forbidden Lord sooner or later.”
 “I look forward to that day.”
 impossible for this brat to surpass him. Shan’e added, “I saw that mysterious figure again just now. He seems to want to help me
 curse.”


 “Is that so? What happened?” Han Jue asked.
 He was indeed puzzled by that mysterious karma existence.
 He could rely on the system to deduce the Dao Creator, but some existences could not, such as the Dao Ancestor.
 This was the interesting thing about existence.
 Sometimes, some things could not be defined by cultivation level.
 Shan’e scratched his head. “He stared at me and cursed. He even reached out. Other than that, nothing else happened.”
 Han Jue narrowed his eyes. That mysterious existence was clearly entangled with Shan’e.
 Could it be that the mysterious existence was related to Shan’e?
 If that was the case, he had to be wary in the future.
 He would purify Shan’e every once in a while.
 Han Jue chatted with him for a while more before
 continuing to cultivate.
 Time passed.
 The Chaos changed drastically when Han Jue reached 100 million years old. The current Chaotic Heroes appeared in large numbers and occupied an area. It became more and more exciting.
 The Creation Emperor Court was the most famous. Its rise was so fast that countless ancient giants were shocked.
 On this day.
 Creation Emperor Court, Heavenly Hall.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor led a group of Divine Generals over. Han Ye and Han Bashen stood in front and protected the platform where Han Ling was stationed.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor looked at her and sighed. “I knew that the famous Emperor would definitely be someone I’m familiar with. However, I didn’t expect it to be you. Back then, you didn’t
 have any ambitions in my eyes.”
 Han Ling’s expression was indifferent as she
 chuckled. “Heavenly Emperor, you and my father are old friends. I’ll listen to you if you have anything to say.”
 The two of them called themselves emperors, and the atmosphere was quite subtle.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor smiled helplessly. “This person is very important. I have no choice but to look for you. If you’re unwilling, then…”
 “I agree!”
 Han Ling interrupted.
 Han Ye was stunned. Han Bashen also hesitated.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor did not expect Han Ling to agree so quickly.
 Han Ling said, “I don’t need rules. If anyone feels
 that I didn’t do well, they can leave. However, correspondingly, they will obtain the Creation Emperor Court’s hatred. I don’t care much about many people, so the karma involved is very small. The chances of being abandoned after joining the Creation Emperor Court are very small, but betraying the Creation Emperor Court will definitely not end well for them.”
 Her words were very domineering, decisive, and
 filled with killing intent, causing the Divine Generals behind the Evil Heavenly Emperor to
 frown.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor looked at her deeply and said, “Thank you, Emperor. From now on, if anything happens to the Creation Emperor Court, send someone to inform me at any time. I will definitely support you with all my might.” Han Ling smiled. “That’s good. From now on, the
 Heavenly Court will be an eternal friend of the Creation Emperor Court. We will go through thick and thin together.”
 She glanced at Han Ye and Han Bashen, who immediately accepted the order.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor was secretly shocked. Han Ye and Han Bashen’s reputations had already been exposed. They were both ruthless figures, especially Han Ye. He couldn’t hold back his killing intent at all. The slaughter had already reached a terrifying level.
 These two ferocious people were so respectful to Han Ling and even a little nervous.
 Emperor Court’s Ultimate Origin Cultivation Potential? This item is extraordinary.”
 “Ultimate Origin Cultivation Potential? What is
 that?”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor was interested.
 Han Ling waved her right hand. In an instant, the
 scene in the Heavenly Hall changed. The ground turned into a lake and countless lotuses appeared. They were of different sizes and colors. It was as beautiful as a dream.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor looked up and suddenly saw a red spirit herb that was as red as blood. The
 twisted figure of the grass looked like the same
 person.
 “Eh?”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor raised his eyebrows
 curiously.
 He exclaimed as he walked over, “How can this
 be?!” The Divine Generals were surprised, not understanding why the Evil Heavenly Emperor was shocked.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor turned to look at Han
 Ling and frowned.
 Han Ling smiled and said, “This cultivation potential can allow transformation. Once it transforms, it will have the ability to change
 everything. If Your Majesty has the intention, when
 it develops intelligence, I will send it to the Heavenly Court for nurturing under Your Majesty
 for thirty million years. At the same time, it will contribute to the Heavenly Court.”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor frowned and asked,
 “From the netherworld.”
 “The netherworld… is it related to him?”
 “Perhaps.”
 “But…”
 “Your Majesty, are you really not tempted?”
 “Alright, leave it to me. I can rest assured.”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor looked at the Ultimate Origin Cultivation Potential again and still frowned.
 Han Jue had just entered seclusion for more than
 two million years when he encountered someone visiting him in his dreams.
 [The Evil Heavenly Emperor sent you a dream. Do you accept?]
 [The Evil Heavenly Emperor sent you a dream. Do you accept?]
 [The Evil Heavenly Emperor sent you a dream. Do
 you accept?]
 Han Jue frowned. Could it be that the Evil
 Heavenly Emperor was in danger?
 He deduced and discovered that the Evil Heavenly
 Emperor was in the Numinous Palace and was not in any danger.
 He hesitated for a moment before agreeing to the
 dream.
 The dream was still in the forest outside the Jade Pure Sacred Sect.
 Evil Heavenly Emperor immediately started to talk
 about the Ultimate Origin Cultivation Potential upon seeing him.
 “The Ultimate Origin Cultivation Potential looks identical to you. I’m worried…”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor sighed with a worried
 expression.
 Han Jue didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. The Ultimate Origin Cultivation Potential had
 transformed into him?
 Speaking of which, this was his Dharmic powers. It
 was normal to transform into him.
 He smiled. “I understand. Ling’er shouldn’t be
 plotting against me, but it’s indeed not a good thing that the other party looks like me.” “I’m just worried. After all, many of my sons have
 betrayed me.” The Evil Heavenly Emperor shook his head.
 The two of them chatted for a while before ending
 the dream.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and started to calculate the Ultimate Origin Cultivation Potential. The Ultimate Origin Cultivation Potential had already developed intelligence, but the resentment was too strong and the killing intent had already been nurtured.
 Could it be related to the netherworld?
 His Ultimate Origin Cultivation Potential had
 absorbed too many ghosts’ grudges after staying
 in the netherworld for so long.
 huge problem in the future.
 No.
 I can’t let it look like me.
 He did not directly erase the Ultimate Origin Cultivation Potential. He wanted to see what Han Ling wanted to do.
 Since he had nothing to do, he wanted to calculate the Ultimate Origin Cultivation Potential’s future. “I want to know what the strongest state of the
 Ultimate Origin Cultivation Potential is.” [1 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do
 you want to continue?]
 Dao Creator?
 Impossible…?
 Han Jue frowned and immediately chose to
 continue.
 His consciousness entered the illusion.
 He discovered
 that he had arrived above the
 Ultimate Origin World. Not far ahead was the
 Chaos. The two Great Dao Worlds were about to
 collide.
 “This is the Ultimate Origin!”
 A wild laugh sounded. Han Jue turned around and
 saw a black-robed man who looked similar to him standing above the Ultimate Origin World, laughing wantonly.


 Why is the Ultimate Origin Cultivation Potential standing in my Ultimate Origin World?
 Han Jue looked at the black-robed man in confusion.
 The black-robed man looked at the Chaos ahead, his eyes filled with madness.
 At this moment, a domineering aura came from the chaos. Its aura was very unfamiliar to Han Jue.
 “Hmph, Ultimate Origin Fiendcelestial, do you think you can do whatever you want just because you obtained the Divine Might Heavenly Sage’s legacy?”
 It wore an Emperor Crown that looked like the head of a Qilin. Its eyes emitted a blood light, like an ancient war god who had slaughtered its way out of purgatory.
 “How arrogant! How impudent!” the Great Dao Divine Spirit shouted angrily. In Han Jue’s opinion, his aura had already reached the perfected Great Dao Supreme.
 Han Jue had seen all the perfected Great Dao Supremes in the Chaos. He had tried to spy on those mighty figures hiding in the dark and noted down their auras and faces, but he had never seen this person.
 It seemed that this was a junior. The current time was too far from Han Jue.
 The Great Dao Divine Spirit suddenly pushed out his palms. The power of the Great Dao poured out with a monstrous force. Countless beams of light burst out from the entire Chaos and attacked in the direction of the Great Dao Divine Spirit’s palms. The scene was extremely spectacular and vast, like a Great Dao World suppressing the Ultimate Origin Cultivation Potential.
 “Hahaha-“
 The Ultimate Origin Cultivation Potential laughed wantonly. Facing the terrifying torrential power of the Chaotic Great Dao, he was fearless and even
 looked forward to it.
 The illusion shattered.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and looked dissatisfied.
 It was the same every time. It ended before the main event.
 It seemed that this battle was the limit of the Ultimate Origin Cultivation Potential. He would either lose or go downhill.
 Tsk tsk, to be powerful enough to challenge the Chaos, the Ultimate Origin Cultivation Potential could be considered successful. At least, the future generations would remember his might for countless years.
 Forget it for the time being.
 These juniors all had an impressive future. There was no need for him to interfere.
 Fate would deal with him if he went astray.
 After thinking, Han Jue closed his eyes and continued cultivating.
 Year after year passed.
 Ten thousand years passed quickly.
 This was equivalent to a nap to Han Jue.
 [Detected that you are 100 million years old and your life has taken another step forward. You have the following choices:]
 [1: Absorb the Chaos immediately. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment, a Primordial Fragment, a Creation Spirit Stone, and a chance to upgrade the system function.]
 [2: Cultivate in a low-profile manner and maintain your original intention. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment, a Primordial Fragment, a Creation Spirit Stone, and an Ultimate Origin Spirit Stone. A chance to upgrade the system function.]
 [You have obtained a Creation Heaven’s Chosen attempt.] Excited, Han Jue immediately chose the second option.
 [You chose to cultivate in a low-profile manner and obtained a Great Dao Fragment, a Primordial Fragment, a Creation Spirit Stone, an Ultimate Origin Spirit Stone, and a chance to upgrade the system function.]
 [Ultimate Origin Spirit Stone: An evolution of the Heavenly Dao Spirit Stone. It can help Dharma treasures advance. No matter how strong the Dharma treasure that is advanced is, it will attach itself to you and will always be controlled by you.]
 Han Jue’s eyes flashed with joy.
 Good stuff!
 He didn’t dare to give his Heavenly Dao Spirit
 Stone to the Book of Misfortune because he was afraid that it would devour him.
 Now!
 He immediately teleported to the main Dao Field and took out the Book of Misfortune and the
 Ultimate Origin Spirit Stone.
 The Ultimate Origin Spirit Stone had the same appearance as the Heavenly Dao Spirit Stone, but it was dark red.
 Han Jue immediately fused it with the Book of Misfortune.
 [Do you want to use the Ultimate Origin Spirit Stone to upgrade the Book of Misfortune?]
 Yes!
 [Beginning to upgrade]
 The Book of Misfortune and the Ultimate Origin
 Spirit Stone disappeared at the same time. He was filled with anticipation.
 Next, he waited here.
 He could test how terrifying the Book of
 Misfortune was when it advanced to an Ultimate Supreme Treasure.
 At this moment…
 [The Ninth Chaos sent you a dream. Do you
 accept?]
 Ninth Chaos?
 Why at this juncture?
 Han Jue cautiously asked, “Will my life be in danger
 after I accept it?”
 Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [No]
 Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief. He had to be cautious when facing a Dao Creator.
 He silently chose to accept the dream. The dream was a blank domain. He saw the Ninth
 Chaos again. It was still so mysterious that his true appearance could not be seen.
 The Ninth Chaos said, “Han Jue, I want to ask you
 about an existence.”
 “Oh? There’s an existence you don’t know about?”
 Han Jue asked with a smile. He couldn’t show nervousness, or a flaw would appear. However, he indeed did not feel any pressure. He had already used the Mystical Destiny Book to change the Dark Forbidden Lord’s identity.
 “The Dark Forbidden Lord. It’s said that you’ve also been cursed by him?” Ninth Chaos asked.
 Han Jue frowned. “That’s right. To be precise, many cultivators of the Heavenly Dao have been cursed by him. In the past, I thought that the Dark Forbidden Lord was a spy of the Chaotic forces. Could it be that he even cursed you?”
 The Ninth Chaos said, “Of course not. It’s just that I
 Han Jue said in a low voice, “There are indeed many cultivators in the Heavenly Dao who use books as Dharma treasures, but there are too many ranges and their cultivation levels are very weak. The strongest is Fuxi. He has the River
 Diagram and the Luo Book and is the Dao Ancestor’s disciple.”
 The Ninth Chaos said, “The cultivation level of the
 Dark Forbidden Lord shouldn’t be strong. He only obtained an Ultimate Dao Treasure. You should know how powerful it is. Perhaps it can’t threaten a
 Dao Creator, but at that time, it could block karma and prevent the Dao Creator from sensing it. Your Dao Field should be an Ultimate Dao Treasure, so when you were weak, others couldn’t find you.” Han Jue shook his head. “Senior, are you suspecting me? I cursed you in the Dao Field? But you can visit me in my dreams, which means that the karma of my Dao Field is not that strong.”
 The Ninth Chaos was silent.
 [Ninth Chaos has a favorable impression of you. Current favorability: 1 star.]
 What the heck?
 He could even develop a favorable impression?
 Could it really be a test?
 Han Jue was surprised, but he didn’t dare to let his
 guard down. One-star favorability was nothing.
 The Ninth Chaos said, “I’ll give you a mission to
 investigate the Dark Forbidden Lord. I’ll give you an opportunity once you find out who he is, an opportunity that can allow a Dao Creator to go
 higher!”
 His tone was calm, but it was filled with confidence.
