Outside the 33rd Heaven.
In the Pangu Hall. Pan Xin sat on the 36th-grade Chaotic Green Lotus and looked disdainfully at a man kneeling in front of him. This man wore a black robe. His hair was disheveled and his face was old. At this moment, his face was ashen and his eyes were empty. “Jin Shen, oh Jin Shen, weren’t you very proud in the past? Do you still think I’m an ant?” Pan Xin asked mockingly. Jin Shen did not answer and continued kneeling.
He didn’t hate the Sages because this was reality!
He had also used his power to suppress others in the past. Now, the tables had turned.
However, he didn’t regret it. He could only blame Pan Xin for being lucky and obtaining Pangu’s inheritance. Looking at the silent Jin Shen, Pan Xin suddenly felt bored.
Before he returned, he had thought of at least ten thousand ways to deal with him. However, when Jin Shen knelt in front of him, the hatred in his heart suddenly dissipated. He knew that Jin Shen was not really convinced, but was forced by the other Sages. He suddenly understood. If Jin Shen really wanted to kill him, why did he suppress him so many times? Although Pan Xin thought of this, he didn’t want to pursue the reason. No matter which Sage it was, as long as they were in the Heavenly Dao, he couldn’t kill them.
Besides, he knew his limits. He had a foul mouth in the past. Other than the new Sages, almost all the other Sages had been offended by him. If he really wanted to settle scores, it would be too troublesome. However, he couldn’t easily let Jin Shen go. If that happened, where would his face go?
He was a Pseudo-Sage. How could he have heard wrongly? Jin Shen was shocked. After a while, he came back to his senses and asked, “Why?” Pan Xin said calmly, “You’ve already been handed over. Other than me, who else can you follow?” Jin Shen had a bitter expression. That’s right. The Sages behind him had already given up on him. Who else could he follow?
Jin Shen gritted his teeth and said, “The Sage will let bygones be bygones. That’s the benevolence of the Sage. Since the Sage is willing to support me, I naturally won’t refuse. I’ll be at your disposal in the future.”
Pan Xin smiled in satisfaction. Taking down Jin Shen was only the first step. His true goal was to control the entire Sage circle. He wanted to dominate the Heavenly Dao!
In the Human Imperial City, Han Yu held an iron plate and studied it repeatedly. There were all sorts of strange words printed on the iron plate. Even Han Yu couldn’t recognize them. This was obtained by Han Yu from the Earth Immortal World. It was very hard. Even Long Hao couldn’t destroy it.
The head of the Han family was not Han Yu, but Han Yu’s son. The young master was naturally Han Yu’s grandson. Han Yu also took good care of his grandson. It was mainly because of Han Jue’s influence that he always felt inexplicably close to the younger generation. Han Yu raised his eyebrows and looked over.
He suddenly exclaimed. “Grand Unity Golden Immortal, but his soul is at the Deity Realm. Strange.” Han Yu had already reached the Six Mystic Divine Origin and could see through the soul. He asked, “Where is the other party from?” The green-robed man said, “This child has recently made a name for himself in the Immortal World. It’s said that he’s the reincarnation of a Calamity Race expert and is extremely talented. Although he’s a Grand Unity Golden Immortal, he has killed several Immortal Emperors.”
This man had a cold expression and powerful blood essence. He emitted a ferocious aura and was struggling with all his might. However, the Dharmic powers of the Six Mystic Divine Origin were not something he, a Grand Unity Golden Immortal, could break free from. Han Yu waved his hand and gestured for the man in the robe to leave.
Then, his gaze landed on the man in the cloth garments. Seeing that the young master’s opponent had been subdued, the green-robed man heaved a sigh of relief and immediately left. “Who are you?” Seeing that he couldn’t break free, the man asked in a low voice.
Han Yu said, “I’m Han Yu of the Han family. The karma between you and my grandson is neither great nor small. There’s no need to fight to the death. Let it go. How about I take you in as my disciple?” Han Yu!
He wants to interfere in the matters of the juniors?” Han Yu shook his head. “If this really goes on, you’ll kill my grandson. The Han family will definitely hunt you down and even cause a conflict between the humans and the Calamity Race. The Calamity Race has been keeping a low profile after entering the Heavenly Dao. Do you want to cause chaos because of this?”
The man was silent. These words were very dangerous to reply to. “I haven’t taken in a disciple yet. It’s not to resolve the conflict,” Han Yu continued. The man was a little tempted.
In the previous calamity, he was almost the strongest existence below the Sages. Later, he became a disciple of the Immeasurable Merit Divine Might Heavenly Sage and obtained the Sage status. If he became Han Yu’s disciple and had the chance to interact with Li Daokong, he had a chance to interact with the Sect Master of the Hidden Sect, Immeasurable Merit Divine Might Heavenly Sage.
He was confident in his talent and needed to find an impressive backer. In the end, he would be stronger than his mother!
The Second Guardian of the Hidden Sect was recruiting disciples outside the Hundred Peak Immortal River. The cloth-robed man had asked around and only found out that they were in-name disciples, so he lost interest.
If he started as an in-name disciple, he would be too inferior to the Sect Master of the Hidden Sect.
If he became Han Yu’s disciple, he would only be three generations inferior to the Sect Master. The Sect Master of the Hidden Sect, Li Daokong, Han Yu, and him. He would be a fourth-generation disciple! In a flash, the man thought of many things. He looked up at Han Yu and said, “Disciple Tian Yong greets Master!”


 Another thousand years passed. Han Jue opened his eyes in a good mood. After reaching the late stage of the Freedom Primordial Chaos Realm, he still needed to cultivate persistently and strive to attain the Great Dao as soon as possible. It had to be said that the Primordial Fiendcelestial’s talent was indeed terrifying. Even at such a high realm, he could still sense visible improvement. Han Jue stood up and headed to the 33rd Heaven. Several years ago, Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du had informed him and agreed to meet at the Universal Hall after his seclusion. After Han Jue entered the hall, Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du immediately informed the other Sages. The other Sages did not have the strange cultivation rules like Han Jue and could be summoned at any time. As for breaking through, Qiu Xilai had already forgotten the taste. To them, the Sage Realm was already the limit. It was very difficult for them to continue.
 Pan Xin also came.
 Seeing Han Jue, he was stunned.
 Han Jue had already retracted his divine light and revealed his unparalleled appearance. Under the Time Dao Robe’s contrast, his temperament was extraordinary “It’s you!”
 He remembered Han Jue. Back in the Sword Dao River, he had felt that this child was talented and even wanted to take him in as a disciple.
 So the Sect Master of the Hidden Sect was this kid.
 At that time, his cultivation level… Pan Xin was shocked, but he smiled on the surface.
 The two of them had not seen each other for a long time. If not for what he saw today, Pan Xin wouldn’t even remember Han Jue.
 Han Jue smiled and nodded. In the boring years, Pan Xin had contributed a lot to his entertainment.
  He still remembered Pan Xin’s back facing him in the Sword Dao River. His shoulders were loose and his hands were doing something.
 Pan Xin sighed. “I didn’t expect you to be the Sect Master of the Hidden Sect.” Han Jue said politely, “Senior’s return is the Heavenly Dao’s fortune. In the future, the Heavenly Dao will still need your protection.”
 Pan Xin smiled even more and found Han Jue very pleasing to the eye.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du did not speak. Emperor Xiao pondered. The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate glanced at Sect Master Tian Jue. Seeing that his expression did not change, he did not think too much about

 Pan Xin was happy because Han Jue was expressing his goodwill. He had already begun to fantasize about subduing him and unifying the Heavenly Dao. He knew very little about Han Jue’s actions after attaining the Dao. The Sages naturally wouldn’t say much. After all, it was more or less a little embarrassing.
 Han Jue’s status was not obtained by currying favor, but by his fists. Heavenly Venerate Wufa, Qiu Xilai, the Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage, Li Muyi… They were all Han Jue’s stepping stones! After the Sages arrived, Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “With the addition of Pan Xin, the providence of the Heavenly Dao has increased greatly. Now, there are two more Sage positions available. Today, we will discuss this.”
 The position of a Sage was very important. Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du definitely couldn’t decide this on his own. Actually, even if he didn’t say it, the other Sages could sense it. As the Heavenly Dao became stronger, the Sages in the future would definitely form circles and fight equally. Emperor Xiao was the first to speak, “It’s time to give our Devil Race a Sage position. Since ancient times, whenever the Heavenly Dao was about to collapse internally, it was always our Devil Race who stood up and became everyone’s target. We let all the living beings of the Heavenly Dao unite and resolve karma.” Han Jue sighed.
 In that case, the Devil Race was actually the scapegoat.
 It was not considered taking the blame. In order to attract hatred, the devils had indeed done many sins.
CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m Qiu Xilai snorted. “Our Western Sect has two Sage Seats since ancient times. Previously, in order to appease your Devil Race, the Dao Ancestor had already cut off a Sage Seat of the Buddhist Sect. It’s time to return it, right?” Pan Xin said domineeringly, “Two more seats are available because of me. I’m already a Freedom Sage. I need to have one seat!”
 His tone was unquestionable and left no room for discussion.
 Fang Liang was also fighting for the Hidden Sect. If the Hidden Sect did not want it, he would give it to the Heavenly Dao Sect. In any case, he had to
 fight.
 Han Jue listened for a while and felt bored. He stood up and left.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du didn’t stop him. It was a good thing that Han Jue didn’t try to fight with them for the Sage Seat. After walking out of the Universal Hall, Han Jue didn’t return to the Hundred Peak Immortal River. Instead, he wandered around the 33rd Heaven. With the Chaotic Supreme Treasure, he wasn’t afraid of being attacked.
 Passing by Li Daokong’s Dao Field, Han Jue saw two people kneeling in front of the door. One of them was Han Yu.
 Han Jue appeared behind them and asked, “Long time no see.”
 The two of them were shocked and subconsciously turned around.
 When they first saw Han Jue, they were all stunned.
 Tian Yong turned to look at Han Yu and discovered that he resembled Han Jue.
 Han Yu also discovered this. Why was this person so similar to him?
 He asked carefully, “You are?” He couldn’t see through Han Jue’s cultivation level, so he naturally followed him. Han Jue smiled. “Can’t you recognize my voice?” Thinking of something, Han Yu’s expression changed drastically. He hurriedly knelt down and said excitedly, “Ancestor!” Seeing Han Yu kneel down, Tian Yong also knelt down.
 Han Jue glanced at Tian Yong and found that his eyebrows were a little familiar. He counted with his fingers and realized that he was the Heavenly Calamity Emperor’s son. Han Yu asked excitedly, “Why are you here?”
 I see!
 I look so similar to my ancestor!
 No wonder his ancestor had saved him. No wonder Li Daokong had taken him in as a disciple. No wonder he had encountered so many mighty figures who treated him well for no reason.
 “I came to take a walk. How have you been?” Han Jue smiled with a kind expression. For some reason, after breaking through to two hundred thousand years old, Han Jue’s mentality began to change. Especially when he saw his descendants personally, he couldn’t help but feel happy.
 Han Yu was flattered and began to talk about his experiences. He did not deliberately talk about the difficulties. With Li Daokong around, it was indeed very difficult for him to encounter a huge crisis. Tian Yong stayed quietly at the side, very curious about Han Jue’s identity. After chatting for a while, Han Jue left. Han Yu was still very excited and couldn’t stop smiling He knew of his ancestor’s existence, but this was the first time he had seen him with his own eyes. This feeling was extremely wonderful. Tian Yong asked curiously, “Master, your ancestor is?”
  Han Yu said, “Don’t ask what you shouldn’t ask!” Tian Yong curled his lips.
 Hehe.
 How mysterious. My mother is a Sage who has attained the Dao with her strength. Am I as pretentious as you?
 On second thought, Tian Yong realized that he was indeed hiding this. Many cultivators were sitting quietly in the Sage Dao Field. It was not as cold as before.
 Two hours later, Han Jue returned to the Daoist temple.
 It had to be said that going out personally had indeed improved his mental state. However, it was only limited to the Heavenly Dao. Although the Time Dao Robe could resist a Great Dao level expert’s attack, what if he encountered an existence that surpassed the Great Dao? There’s still a chance things may go wrong!


 In the Dark Forbidden Zone, a continent floated quietly. Countless demonic birds circled the edge of the continent. Even transformed living beings in armor could be seen patrolling.
 The continent was very vast. There were mountains and rivers everywhere. The sea was located in the center.
 Zhou Fan was stunned. In the next second, he frowned.
 Although he owed the other party, who was far stronger than him, Zhou Fan wouldn’t back down. Seven Dao Sage said calmly, “Do you think that you’ve been revived many times because of the Heavenly Dao?”
 “What do you mean?”
 His fearless personality was developed because he could revive infinitely. He even thought that this was his talent.
  “Every time the Heavenly Dao wants to eliminate you, I am the one protecting you with great Dharmic powers. Your birth is my will!” Seven Dao Sage said expressionlessly, but his tone was heavy. Thunder rumbled in the hall. Zhou Fan’s expression changed drastically as if he had been struck by lightning. Seven Dao Sage stood up and said, “Zhou Fan, you are my pawn. I can create you, I can save you, I can also eliminate you and suppress you. Destroying the Heavenly Dao is your innate mission. It’s irresistible!”
 Zhou Fan’s expression changed. His hands clenched into fists. He looked up at the Seven Dao Sage and asked with a burning gaze, “Was it your scheme that I went crazy back then?”
 Seven Dao Sage was silent. Zhou Fan’s anger was instantly ignited.
 He had once gone mad and killed his good friend, Mo Fuchou. That was a scar in his heart that would never heal. When he learned that he was only a puppet, he wondered if there was something wrong with what happened back then.

 Every time he thought of Mo Fuchou, Zhou Fan would fall into endless self-blame.
 Mo Fuchou was the most important person to him. Ever since he first joined the cultivation sect, Mo Fuchou had been taking care of him.
 Unexpectedly…
 Boom
 Zhou Fan erupted with a terrifying aura as flames visible to the naked eye burned around him. He glared at the Seven Dao Sage and asked, “Why are you plotting this?” The Seven Dao Sage snorted coldly. Endless pressure descended, instantly pressing Zhou Fan to the ground. “The strongest path is to sever all ties. He’s only a mortal. His potential is far from being able to walk side by side with you. I asked you to kill him so that you can eliminate the hidden danger as soon as possible and prevent him from being used by your enemies. Wouldn’t everything go smoothly for you in the future?” Seven Dao Sage snorted. Zhou Fan’s opportunities to revive were all controlled by him. In his opinion, it was just the death of a mortal. What was the big deal?
 If not for the fact that Zhou Fan was his Dharma idol, he wouldn’t have said anything! Zhou Fan tried his best to stand up, but he couldn’t move at all. His eyes were bloodshot as he stared at the Seven Dao Sage and roared hoarsely, “Why? Why must it be me?!”
 Seven Dao Sage said, “It’s impossible for your master to save you. In your life, when has he ever attacked you? He even almost killed you. If not for me, you wouldn’t be here today. I hope you won’t be stubborn!” Zhou Fan still hated him. He growled, “Don’t say such hypocritical words. I only know that a life for a life. It’s only right and proper. You caused my brother’s death. I must kill you!” “A life for a life? Ridiculous. How many people have you killed?”
 “They can’t kill me, just like I can’t kill you. But as long as you don’t kill me, I’ll kill you one day!” Zhou Fan’s voice was filled with endless hatred.
 Seven Dao Sage waved his hand, and a golden bell descended from the sky, directly suppressing Zhou Fan.
 “How laughable. A chess piece dares to attack its master? “Your only backing is me. You will understand sooner or later.”
 Seven Dao Sage smiled disdainfully and sat down with his eyes closed. Even if Zhou Fan became a Sage, he was not his match.
 If not for the fact that Zhou Fan was a Dharma idol he had nurtured for a long time and he could not bear to kill him, how could he allow Zhou Fan to say such big words?
 Han Jue only learned about Zhou Fan being suppressed a thousand years later. After his seclusion ended, he habitually checked his emails and happened to see this. (Your disciple Zhou Fan was attacked by your enemy, Seven Dao Sage. He was severely injured.] (Your disciple Zhou Fan was suppressed by your enemy, Seven Dao Sage.]
 Han Jue was stunned.
  What was going on? Did the two of them fall out? Han Jue immediately used the derivation function. After consuming three billion years of his lifespan, he saw the illusion of Zhou Fan and the Seven Dao Sage confronting each other. When he opened his eyes again, Han Jue sighed. What a good Zhou Fan! He was not convinced! But Seven Dao Sage, how dare you look down on me?
 Han Jue took out the Book of Misfortune. He knew that if he cursed the Seven Dao Sage crazily, he would expose his identity as the Dark Forbidden Lord.
 But so what?
 Zhou Fan’s unyielding attitude moved him. How many years had it been? Han Jue had never been hot-blooded or fought for his life.
 “Disciple, wait. You’re not alone.”


 In the Dark Forbidden Zone, a continent floated quietly. Countless demonic birds circled the edge of the continent. Even transformed living beings in armor could be seen patrolling.
 The continent was very vast. There were mountains and rivers everywhere. The sea was located in the center.
 At this moment, on a desolate plain, lightning interweaved and gathered on a figure. It was Zhou Fan! Zhou Fan’s upper body was naked as he sat on the ground. No matter how the lightning struck him, his expression did not change. His body was like a rock and did not tremble at all. “Return to the hall.” A voice entered Zhou Fan’s ears. He directly transformed into a bolt of lightning and shot into the sky, disappearing. At the end of the plain, a mountain peak towered into the clouds. On the peak sat a majestic palace. It was sinister and terrifying, like a chaotic ferocious beast. A bolt of lightning rushed into the hall and transformed into a human before landing on the ground. Zhou Fan looked up and asked, “What is it?” Following his gaze, there were steps ahead. There was a huge stone chair on the hundreds of steps. A black-robed man sitting on the stone chair slowly opened his eyes. If Han Jue was here, he would definitely recognize him. Seven Dao Sage! Seven Dao Sage looked down at Zhou Fan and said, “You’ve already attained the Dao. What are your plans next?” Zhou Fan said, “It’s all thanks to you. I owe you a favor. Tell me, how should I repay you? Of course, the premise is that it can’t go against my principles and bottom line!” After attaining the Dao, Zhou Fan became even more confident. Seven Dao Sage said, “If I ask you to break the Heavenly Dao, are you willing?”
 Zhou Fan was stunned. In the next second, he frowned.
 Although he owed the other party, who was far stronger than him, Zhou Fan wouldn’t back down. Seven Dao Sage said calmly, “Do you think that you’ve been revived many times because of the Heavenly Dao?”
 “What do you mean?”
  “Every time the Heavenly Dao wants to eliminate you, I am the one protecting you with great Dharmic powers. Your birth is my will!” Seven Dao Sage said expressionlessly, but his tone was heavy.

After consuming three billion years of his lifespan, he saw the illusion of Zhou Fan and the Seven Dao Sage confronting each other. When he opened his eyes again, Han Jue sighed. What a good Zhou Fan! He was not convinced! But Seven Dao Sage, how dare you look down on me?
 There was nothing to say!
 Han Jue took out the Book of Misfortune. He knew that if he cursed the Seven Dao Sage crazily, he would expose his identity as the Dark Forbidden Lord.
 But so what?
 Zhou Fan’s unyielding attitude moved him. How many years had it been? Han Jue had never been hot-blooded or fought for his life.
 “Disciple, wait. You’re not alone.”


 He had also been cursed by the Dark Forbidden Lord before, but it ended in less than five days. This was the first time it had lasted more than five days, and the power of the curse had begun to increase.
 The Dark Forbidden Lord wanted to attack him?
 Why was that?
 Seven Dao Sage looked at the golden bell in the hall. He suddenly thought of something and narrowed his eyes. He thought of the guesses of the Dark Forbidden Lord.
 He was enlightened. “So you’re the Dark Forbidden Lord. No wonder I couldn’t find you. It seems that what the Dao Ancestor said was true. The variable of the Great Dao Calamity… Dark Forbidden Lord…”
 Seven Dao Sage’s eyes flickered as he began to circulate his energy to resist.
 The Dark Forbidden Lord was notorious. He had to be cautious.
 After all, the Chaotic Deity and Cundi were already examples.
  In order to guard against the curse of the Dark Forbidden Lord, he was already prepared. The black robe fluttered as strange lights spread out from Seven Dao Sage’s body, forming a halo that enveloped his body. The curse power weakened greatly. Seven Dao Sage heaved a sigh of relief and smiled disdainfully. He wanted to rely on curses to dominate the Chaos?
 Impossible!
 Inside the Daoist temple. Han Jue cursed as he stared at his attributes panel and emails.
 He had already lost 3 quadrillion years of his lifespan, but he still did not see anything happen to Seven Dao Sage. This fellow was not simple! Han Jue didn’t dare to underestimate the other party. This fellow’s reach was too far. In order to nurture Zhou Fan, he had spent 200,000 years. Who knew if he had other pawns?
 No matter what, even if the Dao Ancestor appeared today, Han Jue had to kill the Seven Dao Sage. He was too arrogant!
 You bullied my disciple and even mocked me for not daring to attack? Han Jue cursed with all his might. 4 quadrillion years! 5 quadrillion years!
 (Because of your curse, your enemy, Seven Dao Sage, had his Dao heart shattered.]
 Heh!
 In the hall.
 The Seven Dao Sage’s expression was extremely gloomy. His body was like a phantom that kept fluctuating as if it would disappear at any moment.
 “Damn it, why is his curse so strong? Did he sacrifice living beings? Did he sacrifice the entire Heavenly Dao?” Seven Dao Sage muttered to himself. He looked up and saw that the Heavenly Dao was still there.
 He couldn’t figure it out. However, he shouldn’t think about this now.
 No!
 If this continued, he would follow in the footsteps of the Chaotic Deity and Cundi!
 Boom
 Seven Dao Sage’s body exploded and dissipated into dust.
 Immediately after, he regathered his body with a pale face.
 At this moment, a black wind swept into the hall and transformed into a black shadow that landed in front of him.
 Seven Dao Sage frowned and asked in a low voice, “Who are you?” Seeing the other party transform into a black shadow, he subconsciously thought of the Dark Forbidden Lord.
 Seven Dao Sage asked, “What’s your relationship with the Dark Forbidden Lord?” The black shadow replied, “It doesn’t matter who I am. I’m here to remind you that you can’t block his curse. If you wait any longer, you’ll die.” Seven Dao Sage was silent. The black shadow continued, “Kill yourself and leave behind a remnant soul. Follow me. I can protect you and take revenge on the Dark Forbidden Lord in the future.” Seven Dao Sage said in a low voice, “What a joke. Go with you?”
 The black shadow was silent. Seven Dao Sage’s body exploded and then recondensed again. He couldn’t hold on any longer!
 The black shadow said, “I’m the Curse Fiendcelestial. The Dark Forbidden Lord is good at using the power of my Great Dao. I will definitely eliminate him. Only by following me can you avoid his curse!”
 Curse Fiendcelestial? Chaotic Fiendcelestial!
 Seven Dao Sage’s pupils suddenly dilated. He didn’t expect a curse to attain the Dao. In his mind, wasn’t cursing the Dao of Karma? Another wave of violent curse power attacked. The Seven Dao Sage knew that he had no time to hesitate. He immediately self-destructed, leaving behind a wisp of his remnant soul that flew towards the Curse Fiendcelestial.
 The Curse Fiendcelestial raised its hand and waved. It took Seven Dao Sage away and disappeared from the hall.
 At the same time.
 Han Jue felt the power of the curse being absorbed by a strange force. This feeling was unprecedented. He saw an email.
 (Your enemy, the Curse Fiendcelestial, is absorbing your curse power.]
 Curse Fiendcelestial!
 Han Jue immediately stopped.
 This fellow had been missing since he was born. Han Jue didn’t expect him to find Seven Dao Sage. Fortunately, the emails showed that the Seven Dao Sage had died, leaving only a remnant soul. A pitiful Great Dao Divine Spirit who had schemed for countless years had died just like that. Han Jue asked in his mind, “Is the Curse Fiendcelestial my match?”
 (150 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [Not for the time being.)
 Han Jue asked, “Will it be dangerous for me to save Zhou Fan now?”
 (3 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [Not for the time being.) Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief and immediately sent a dream to Zhou Fan.
 In the dream. Zhou Fan opened his eyes and saw him. He wasn’t surprised, but his expression darkened.
 Han Jue asked, “What’s wrong?” Zhou Fan smiled. “It’s nothing, Master. I just became a Sage recently. When I return, I will definitely strengthen the Hidden Sect!”
 He looked smug and became as high-spirited as before. Han Jue was speechless. Was this kid still acting?
 That made sense.
 If not for Han Jue having the system, he really wouldn’t have been able to deduce his situation.
 Zhou Fan began to talk about his fortuitous encounters without mentioning the Seven Dao Sage. It was obvious that he didn’t want Han Jue to worry.
 He only felt guilty toward Han Jue.
 After being his disciple for so many years, he had never repaid Han Jue. Now, he had caused such trouble.
 Han Jue interrupted, “Hurry up and use the Invocation Technique!”
 Zhou Fan was stunned.
 He instantly understood that he sent a dream because he was in trouble.
 He was touched.
 “Master, you…” Zhou Fan wanted to continue.
  Han Jue said, “Hurry up!” There was so much nonsense. If he waited any longer, there might be a change. Han Jue could use the Invocation Technique to summon all the disciples who had grasped the technique back. He couldn’t summon them individually. He was only saving Zhou Fan now, so there was no need to make such a big fuss.
 “I was…”
 “Seven Dao Sage, I know. He’s already gone!” “Huh?”
 Zhou Fan was shocked. Han Jue directly removed the dream.
 Soon, a black vortex appeared in front of him. Han Jue stepped in and appeared in front of Zhou Fan. They were covered by a golden bell. Zhou Fan had a spell cast on him and lay on the ground, unable to move. Han Jue waved his sleeve and directly removed Zhou Fan’s restriction, shattering the golden bell.
 The Seven Dao Sage had already fled. The array formation left behind was naturally weak. Of course, ordinary Sages couldn’t break through this bell.
