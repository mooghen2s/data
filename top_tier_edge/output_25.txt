 Space collapsed and was reconstructed.
 Even from afar, the vast Dharmic powers were terrifying
 Apart from Xu Dudao, there were other cultivators nearby. Anyone below the Pseudo-Sage Realm would be crushed into dust on the spot.
 Han Jue observed carefully.
 Life and the Chaotic Fiendcelestial were both Great Dao Sages. Han Jue felt that they were stronger than Ancestor Xitian.
 That made sense. Their value was higher than Ancestor Xitian and the Great Dao Sages in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End.
  The Chaotic Fiendcelestial had the body of a human and the head of a tiger or leopard. A sinister python was coiled around its waist, and dozens of huge skulls floated behind it. There were all sorts of things. At first glance, it looked like a bloodthirsty demon that had run out of the land of extreme evil.
 Not bad!
 Han Jue noticed that the Chaotic Fiendcelestial’s attack landed on Life as if it was a phantom. It passed through him, unable to cause any damage.
 Han Jue silently noted down Life’s figure and tried to see if he could deduce it later.
 A sinister smile suddenly sounded. It was extremely cautious.
 Life suddenly jumped away and raised his four arms. A dazzling light suddenly burst forth, causing everything to lose its color.
 Even Han Jue lost his vision.
 The illusion shattered.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and frowned.
 It ended so quickly. Did that mean that the Chaotic Fiendcelestial would be defeated after that move?
 Han Jue asked in his mind, “Who is this figure in my mind?”
 [The other party has a special Supreme Treasure that cannot be deduced.]
 “Then, can I insta-kill him?”
 [The other party has a special Supreme Treasure that cannot be deduced.]
 From the battle just now, Life was indeed strong, but it was not powerful enough to exceed his understanding.
 He could fight!
 “Continue cultivating and try to kill him as soon as possible.”
 Han Jue thought.
 Time passed quickly.
 Another ten thousand years passed.
 Han Jue came to the second Dao Field and let Li Yao out.
 Li Yao had already transformed into the Undying Fiendcelestial. Han Jue took out a robe and let her wear it.
 “How do you feel?” Han Jue asked with a smile.
 He retracted Li Yao’s authority in the simulation trial and the Myriad Worlds Projection to confirm the confidentiality.
 Li Yao tidied her clothes and said seriously, “Very good. Compared to before, I’ve been reborn. Thank you.”
 Han Jue said, “What’s there to thank between us? Cultivate in my Daoist temple in the future.”
 Li Yao looked around and asked in surprise, “Where are we?”
 She scanned with her divine sense and was even more surprised.
 Including her, there were already eleven Chaotic Fiendcelestials in the second Dao Field!
 Han Jue waved his hand again and released the Void Fiendcelestial.
 Han Jue brought them out of the Daoist temple and gathered all the Fiendcelestials in front of it.
 Murong Qi, Guan Bubai, Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial, and the others were very excited to see Li Yao and the Void Fiendcelestial.
 Another new member!
 Han Jue introduced them to each other and let the Fiendcelestials sit down. He then began to preach.
 Han Jue spoke very seriously this time. He wanted to help Murong Qi, the crimson fox, the Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial, and Guan Bubai attain the Dao in one go. As for the others, they would strive to improve as much as possible.
 Although Li Yao was a Pseudo-Sage, she was still a distance away from attaining the Dao.
 This lecture lasted for five hundred years.
 After Han Jue finished his lecture, he told the Fiendcelestials to disperse.
 Li Yao followed him back to the Daoist temple. She was still thinking about the Dao technique Han Jue taught, and it was extremely beneficial.
 Han Jue waved his hand and took out a Heavenly Puppet, placing it in a corner.
 “If there’s anything you need, inform me through him,” Han Jue reminded. As more and more Fiendcelestials appeared, it would definitely not be as easy to manage as before. There might be a conflict that even Murong Qi could not mediate.
 Chaotic Fiendcelestials were a warlike race!
 Li Yao nodded.
 Han Jue then returned to the main Dao Field.
 He sat on the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus and heaved a sigh of relief.
 The next time he opened his eyes, Murong Qi and the other three should be able to succeed.
 The Fiendcelestial Army officially set sail.
 (Your good friend Evil Heavenly Emperor was attacked by a Chaotic Fiendcelestial and was severely injured.)
 (Your son Han Tuo was attacked by the descendants of the Fiendcelestial] x9033218
 [Your grand-disciple Chu Shiren was attacked by the descendants of the Fiendcelestial] x634489
 (Your good friend Ancestor Xitian has reconstructed the Great Dao. His cultivation has increased greatly.)
 (Your good friend Xu Dudao received a dream from a mysterious mighty figure. His cultivation has increased.]
 (Your good friend Shi Dudao accidentally entered a spatial crack and his cultivation weakened.]
 (Your good friend Immortal Emperor Samsara has entered the Chaotic Spring. His soul has been cleansed and his providence has increased greatly.)
 (Your good friend Huang Zuntian has obtained the power of Primordial Origin. His providence has increased greatly.]
 Huh?
 Why is Chu Shiren hanging out with the Heavenly Court?
 Heavenly Emperor, you keep poaching my talents!
 Han Jue secretly heaved a sigh of relief.
 Chu Shiren followed the Evil Heavenly Emperor and should be fine.
 He understood the Evil Heavenly Emperor. He would rather die than let his people die.
 The reason why Han Tuo could cultivate so quickly and even surpass Han Jue’s personal disciples was because of the Evil Heavenly Emperor.
 Han Jue continued reading.
 His good friends had their own opportunities, and some were unlucky.
 However, Huang Zuntian’s cultivation was indeed increasing. Since it was the path he chose, Han Jue had no reason to stop him.
 He read the emails with relish.
 This meant that the Great Dao Sage also liked to surf the web.
 After reading the emails, Han Jue immersed himself in cultivation.
 He wanted to break through a minor realm before Life came!
 In a purple space, countless figures were fighting
  Space distorted and mixed with white beams of light, like an illusion.
 Although he had the upper hand, his expression was solemn.
 This battle had lasted for more than five thousand years. He couldn’t take it anymore.
 He turned around and saw that Han Tuo and Zhou Fan were still fighting.
 That’s right, the Heavenly Court and the Great Dao Tower had joined forces again. This time, the Great Dao Tower had also brought many Hidden Sect disciples, including Qin
 Ling.
 Qin Ling’s performance was also eye-catching. His halberd attacked with unstoppable force.


 Han Tuo waved his halberd and shouted, “Yi Tian, save my grand-disciple!”
 Zhou Fan had contacted Li Xuan’ao. The latter had sent Hidden Sect disciples to train, and among them was Qin Ling. Li Xuan’ao had emphasized this fellow. After Zhou Fan learned of it, he told Han Tuo. After he learned of it, Han Tuo paid special attention to Qin Ling, as if he was making up for his debt to Han Yu.
 “Alright!” Yi Tian shouted and suddenly appeared above the troll’s head from millions of kilometers away. He swung his staff angrily and broke the troll’s arm.
 Qin Ling broke free and looked at him gratefully. Yi Tian grinned and swung his staff at the troll’s head again. The ten-thousand-foot-tall troll was sent flying.
 The power he displayed excited Qin Ling.
 After fighting for so long, he was also very tired, but he was more excited.
  He had finally found the life he wanted.
 That was to battle!
 On the other side.
 Zhou Fan and the Evil Heavenly Emperor landed on a huge jade flute. The Evil Heavenly Emperor was severely injured. His lower body was gone and his waist was covered in blood. A strange black aura surrounded his wound, preventing him from healing his body in a short period of time.
 “Damn it, why are the Chaotic Fiendcelestials so difficult to deal with?”
 Zhou Fan cursed. He looked at the Evil Heavenly Emperor and asked, “Your Majesty, what’s your backing? What tricks do you have? Hurry up and tell me! My subordinates can’t die in vain!”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor frowned. He struggled for a moment and opened his right hand. It was a bone fragment.
 “I can only ask him to help again.”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor sighed.
 Zhou Fan asked curiously, “Who is it?”
 He squeezed his right hand, and the bone fragment shattered into dust.
 Zhou Fan was even more curious. “What’s your relationship with the Inauspicious Divine Emperor? This is not the first time you’ve asked him for help.”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor sighed again. “He’s my biological father.”
 Zhou Fan was stunned.
 The Inauspicious Divine Emperor!
 So fast!
 Zhou Fan was secretly shocked. It seemed that the Inauspicious Divine Emperor was really the Evil Heavenly Emperor’s father.
 The living beings of the Heavenly Court and the Great Dao Tower had seen the Inauspicious Divine Emperor before. Seeing his appearance, their morale immediately soared!
 The Chaotic Heavenly Road quietly stretched across the Dark Forbidden Zone. It was the only light in the darkness.
 On one of the paths, Shi Dudao and Li Daokong meditated with their backs facing each other.
 Shi Dudao suddenly opened his eyes and frowned.
 Li Daokong seemed to sense something and also opened his eyes.
 “You sensed it?” Shi Dudao asked softly.
 The two of them were ten thousand miles apart.
 Li Daokong replied, “Something is spying on
 us.”
 With that, he stood up.
 Shi Dudao did the same.
 Li Daokong suddenly appeared beside him, and the two of them looked in the same direction.
 Following their gaze, it was still dark and there was nothing there.
 After a long while…
 A sneer came from the darkness. “Heavenly Dao Sages? You’re really weak. If not for you staying in the Chaotic Heavenly Road, you would already be dead.
 “I’m a Primordial Chaos Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal like you, but I can easily tear the two of you apart.”
  Shi Dudao frowned.
 Li Daokong said expressionlessly, “Isn’t this provocation too weak?”
 Shi Dudao replied, “In the current Heavenly Dao, one doesn’t need the Primordial Purple Qi to attain the Dao.”
 “The Primordial Purple Qi is not only to attain the Dao. It’s a key, a key to the Source of Chaos. Do you know why the previous Heavenly Dao Sages could attain the Great Dao Sage Realm?”
 The mocking tone changed to one filled with bewitchment.
 Li Daokong and Shi Dudao were silent.
 He sneered and snorted. “Don’t you want to know who Life is? Come and fight me.”
 Li Daokong frowned, “Are you Life?”
 “I’m not, but I know who Life is. Actually, there’s more than one Life.”
 “What do you mean?”
 “Come out and fight me. The eldest disciple of the Human School, the First Guardian of the Hidden Sect, is so cowardly? Have you heard of Divine Lord Peacock? He dared to attack a Sage when he was only a Pseudo-Sage. You’re far inferior to him. You’re not worthy of being called prodigies!”
 The mocking laughter became hysterical.
 Shi Dudao sent a voice transmission to Li Daokong, “This fellow is abnormal. Don’t be fooled.”
 Li Daokong replied, “He’s using us as a breakthrough point. If we refuse, he will definitely find other Sages. Why don’t we take the risk? I have a special method to contact the Sect Master.”
 Shi Dudao frowned and hesitated.
 Li Daokong stepped forward. “Don’t go back on your word.”
 “Come! Li Daokong! The legendary Great Dao Sword Sage. I wonder if the young you has the bearing of a Sword Sage!”
 The sneer became extremely excited.
 Li Daokong flew out of the Chaotic Heavenly Road. Shi Dudao gritted his teeth and followed closely behind. The two of them vanished into the darkness.
 Han Jue opened his eyes, indicating that another ten thousand years had passed.
 It was not easy for him to be so powerful, but he actually did not have a chance to show his strength.
 He missed the time when he saved Han Tuo.
 That felt really good.
 Han Jue began to observe the Immortal World.
 The dynasty of the Human Race had already transformed into an empire. The Human Emperors were all above the nine heavens. The Human Race already had more than a thousand dynasties that were conferred throughout the Immortal World. Other than sending geniuses to the Chaotic Heavenly Road, these dynasties also sent cultivators to the mortal world to preach.
 Above the empire was the Human Emperor Temple, which controlled the prosperity of the Human Race.
 It was the same for the Providence Sect. It became stricter.
 There were already more than three hundred Pseudo-Sages and nearly ten thousand Zenith Heaven Golden Immortals in the Immortal World.
 The development in the past two hundred thousand years had exceeded the previous calamities. It was mainly because there were no Sages suppressing them and the Chaotic Heavenly Road was seeking Chaotic resources. The increase in the providence of the Heavenly Dao also caused the Spirit Qi in the Immortal World to constantly increase.
 Han Jue stood at the peak of the Heavenly Dao and looked down at the myriad worlds, taking in all the forms of living beings.
  He was in a good mood.
 This was his territory!
 Han Jue checked the emails and saw an email the moment he opened it. He instantly frowned.
 [Your good friend Li Daokong was attacked by a mysterious force and transformed into Life.]
 Transformed into Life?
 Was this the Life he had been worried about?
 There was more than one Life?
 Han Jue immediately checked Li Daokong’s profile picture.


 Calamity Life Controller?
 What happened to him?
 Han Jue frowned. He had no choice but to use the derivation function to ask what a Calamity Life Controller was.
 (1 trillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 (Calamity Life Controller: Great Dao Providence Divine Authority, just like the Connate providence of the Heavenly Dao. Other than identity, it is also a form of authority, a divine authority that can stir the calamity and not be affected by karma.]
  Great Dao Divine Authority?
 Han Jue thought of the Chaotic Deities. Could it be that they all grasped a Great Dao Providence Divine Authority?
 Then, Han Jue sent a dream to Li Daokong.
 The dream quickly formed.
 Han Jue saw Li Daokong in the void. The latter was dressed in black and his black hair was naturally disheveled. He had a cold expression, and a black sword pattern could be seen between his eyebrows.
 The current Li Daokong did not look like a good person.
 Li Daokong opened his eyes, his pupils overflowing with killing intent.
 Seeing that it was Han Jue, his killing intent instantly retracted.
 Li Daokong said in surprise, “Sect Master, you sensed that something happened to me?”
 Han Jue usually didn’t look for him.
 According to the time, Han Jue should have just finished his seclusion. He sent a dream to him so quickly, which meant that he was really worried about him.
 Li Daokong was touched.
 Han Jue usually looked distant and calm to everyone, but he would never hide when they encountered trouble.
 Zhou Fan had described Han Jue’s shocking move to them in the Myriad Worlds Projection.
 Han Jue said, “Tell me.”
 Li Daokong spoke truthfully. In order to obtain information about Life, he was deliberately provoked by a mysterious enemy. In the end, he and Shi Dudao were quickly defeated by the other party. When he woke up again, Li Daokong came to a special space. He was the only one in the space. He was soaked in a pool and his body and soul were modified by a strange force. He could not move.
 “More than one Life?” Han Jue asked.
 Li Daokong nodded. “That’s right. I saw more than three individual Lives. They took turns to check the changes in my cultivation, but I couldn’t see their faces clearly. It was very strange. I clearly saw them, but I couldn’t remember their faces.”
 Li Daokong hesitated for a moment and then said, “Probably not. If that really happens to me, I’ll contact the Hidden Sect immediately.”
 Han Jue nodded. “Remember, don’t force yourself. The Invocation Technique I taught you is not a forbidden technique. You can summon me.”
 “Sect Master, don’t worry. I still want to take a look and search for more information.”
 “Mm.”
 Han Jue directly removed the dream to avoid being discovered.
 Inside the Daoist temple. Han Jue opened his eyes and frowned.
 More than three Lives had already appeared?
 Life was a force?
 Han Jue couldn’t understand and decided not to think about it. Anyway, Li Daokong was safe for the time being.
 Even if Li Daokong was caught off guard and enslaved, Han Jue still had Absolute Purification and the Primordial Heavenly Prison to use.
 Han Jue came to the second Dao Field and observed the cultivation situation of the Fiendcelestials.
 He was not disappointed. Murong Qi, the crimson fox, the Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial, and Guan Bubai had all successfully attained the Dao.
 Han Ming, the Time Fiendcelestial, the Traversal Fiendcelestial, and the Fog Fiendcelestial had all stepped into the Pseudo-Sage Realm.
 Han Jue’s gaze landed on Yang Du.
 This fellow had yet to reach the Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm. The restriction on his potential was too great.
 He had to work hard for a period of time before he would cherish the favor Han Jue gave him.
 Li Yao opened her eyes and saw him beside her. She hurriedly stood up.
 Seeing how happy she was, Han Jue also became happy.
 He was quite useful to the people around him!
 Several days later, Han Jue returned to the main Dao Field and continued cultivating in seclusion.
 Since no one took the initiative to ask him for help, he would cultivate in peace.
 It would be best if no one needed his help or found trouble with him. Then, he could continue cultivating until he reached the
 peak.
 Outside the 33rd Heaven, in the Universal Hall, Sages gathered.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du asked, “There’s still no news of Li Daokong and Shi Dudao?”
 Pan Xin shook his head. “No, they left the Chaotic Heavenly Road. There are no traces of destruction. They probably went to seek opportunities.”
 Heavenly Venerate Wufa snorted. “They are really straightforward. They usually have nothing to do in the Heavenly Dao.”
 The other Sages agreed.
 In the past, they felt that it was good that Li Daokong and Shi Dudao did not fight for power. However, as the Heavenly Dao developed and became better and better, there were more and more places that the Sages needed to be responsible for. They began to envy the two of them.
 So what if they developed Providence Sects?
 Cultivation was the key.
 Just like Han Jue.
 They were active, but their disciples were always poached. Occasionally, there would even be signs of rebellion.
 “Recently, a large number of descendants of Pangu have appeared in the Immortal World and the myriad worlds. Fellow Daoist Pan, tell me about the situation.” Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du changed the topic.
 This meeting was mainly about the internal affairs of the Immortal World, so he didn’t inform Han Jue.
 Pan Xin’s expression was ugly. “I’m not sure either, but they indeed all have Pangu’s bloodline. I suspect that Giant God Pangu might not be dead. He’s staring at the Heavenly Dao in the dark. He might even be the Heavenly Dao.”
 The Sages were moved.
 Fang Liang said, “Impossible! The Heavenly Dao is not Pangu. The spirit of the Heavenly Dao has already fused with me. It is a separate intelligence and is still rejected by the rules of the Heavenly Dao.”
 The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate said, “How’s the potential of these descendants?”
 Jin Shen said, “Very strong. Almost all of them are geniuses.”
 “Isn’t that a good thing?”
 Jin Shen looked worried.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du also frowned. This was indeed troublesome.
 They couldn’t directly capture them, because these descendants had their own relatives, friends, and even factions. If they captured all of them, it would probably alarm all living beings.
 At that time, how would they explain it?
 Would they say that Pangu was an enemy?
 All living beings of the Heavenly Dao owed the Giant God Pangu a favor.
 Pangu transformed into all living beings and created the world!


 He glanced at the other Sages and continued, “Pangu is already very far away. We can no longer spread his legend. Isn’t the trend of geniuses now? Immeasurable Merit Divine Might Heavenly Sage became a Sage in thirty thousand years. If this matter is spread to all living beings, won’t it motivate them?
 “Focus the worship and reverence of all living beings on the Immeasurable Merit Divine Might Heavenly Sage. It can also prevent Pangu’s descendants from overturning the Heavenly Dao in the future.”
 His words caused the Sages’ expressions to change.
 He was using this opportunity to suppress Pangu and push Han Jue up! What a lackey!
 Jin Shen, Emperor Xiao, and the South Extreme Heavenly Venerate cursed.
 Qiu Xilai was really pretentious, but they didn’t dare to refute him directly.
  The Heavenly Dao Sages who remained now more or less had some feelings and principles. The truly shameless, shrewd, and evil Sages had already been destroyed by Han Jue.
 Fang Liang said, “I think Fellow Daoist is right. This is indeed a good method. After all, my Grandmaster doesn’t need such a reputation at all. Even if he gives it to you, it won’t affect the current Heavenly Dao. If it were anyone else, they might be arrogant and suppress the Sages, but my Grandmaster won’t. You should have already felt it.”
 The Sages nodded.
 That was the truth.
 All the Sages who were used by Han Jue were a threat to him.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du, Emperor Xiao, Jin Shen, and the South Extreme Heavenly Venerate asked themselves. Han Jue indeed didn’t make things difficult for them. Even if the difference in cultivation level was already great, he wouldn’t put on airs when talking to them.
 The Sages began to express their agreement.
 Emperor Xiao looked at Pan Xin in surprise. This fellow actually supported him, and he was not forced to. He was even passionate.
 This fellow really joined Han Jue!
 In his opinion, Pan Xin and Qiu Xilai were fighting for favor.
 Emperor Xiao quickly adjusted his state of mind. In that case, he would help Pan Xin fight for favor and try his best to gain Han Jue’s trust so that he could live better in the Heavenly Dao in the future.
 The Sages began to plan how to suppress Pangu’s descendants and establish the legend of the Divine Might Heavenly Sage.
 Pan Xin was the most eager. Because he was also a descendant of Pangu, it was easier for him to approach the other descendants.
 The Sages were secretly envious, especially Qiu Xilai. They didn’t expect that they would only benefit Pan Xin.
 In a gray and mysterious space, Li Daokong sat naked in a pool. The outside of the pool was filled with dense mist and one could not see the distance. The water in the pool was hot, green, and sometimes purple.
 Plop!
 A figure suddenly landed beside Li Daokong, but the water did not splash.
 It was Shi Dudao!
 Shi Dudao quickly adjusted his posture. His aura was weak and his hair was messy. It was obvious that he had been beaten up.
 Li Daokong said in surprise, “You’re not dead?”
 Shi Dudao stabilized his breathing and rolled his eyes at him. “You really want me to die? Dog, if I didn’t listen to you, would I have suffered such a calamity?”
 Li Daokong was not embarrassed and even smiled.
 At this moment, Life’s voice sounded.
 Li Daokong frowned and asked, “What is Darkness?”
 Life replied, “Before the Chaos is Darkness. Darkness is the true appearance of all of this. You still have to stay here for at least a million years. Don’t forget to cultivate diligently.” “So long?!” Shi Dudao shouted, but Life did not answer.
 He knew Han Jue’s potential the best. The current Han Jue was only 300,000 years old and could already resist the Great Dao Sages.
 A million years later, he would kill people like slaughtering chickens and pigs!
 Shi Dudao smiled bitterly. “I have to stay in the same pool as you for a million years. It’s better to kill me.”
 Li Daokong snorted. “Then kill yourself.”
 “Hehe.”
  The two of them fell silent.
 After a long while…
 Shi Dudao asked, “How many Lives have you seen?”
 Li Daokong said, “What about you?” “The Heavenly Dao is in danger.”
 They had been easily suppressed by one Life, let alone at least five. How strong were they? Moreover, if these Lives all controlled powerful forces, how terrifying would they be when gathered together?
 Li Daokong said, “Cultivate first. We have no choice.”
 “Mm.”
 Chaos, Heavenly Court.
 After more than ten thousand years of development, the Heavenly Court found a space and established a new location. The palace was dotted with stars and the Heavenly troops patrolled in formation. In the center of the Heavenly Court was the Numinous Palace.
 In the hall, immortals gathered. It was even more lively than the Heavenly Dao Heavenly Court in the past.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor sat on the Emperor’s throne and quietly listened to the argument between the Literature Immortals and the Heavenly Generals.
 Three Deity Realm experts stood in the front row but did not interrupt.
 Not only did the Heavenly Court need to constantly fight, but it also needed the Literature Immortals to manage the internal affairs and govern the various worlds and races under them.
 Unlike the Heavenly Dao Heavenly Court, there were no Sage factions, so the quarrels in the Heavenly Court were still benign and did not affect harmony.
 Chu Shiren was also among them, but he was not a Literature Immortal, but a Heavenly General.
 “Tsk tsk tsk—”
 A strange laugh suddenly entered the Numinous Palace, cutting off the immortals’ voices.
 All the immortals shut up and turned around. There were no guests outside the hall, nor were there any strangers.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor frowned.
 The strange laughter sounded again. “Heavenly Court? Nothing much. I am Life. Evil Heavenly Emperor, do you dare to make a bet with me?”
 Life?
 The immortals were in an uproar. This name had often been heard in the Chaos recently. The Heavenly Court was attacking the Chaotic Fiendcelestials, and so was Life.
 However, unlike the difficulties of the Heavenly Court, Life had already subdued three Chaotic Fiendcelestials alone.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor snorted. “What bet?”
 Han Tuo, Yi Tian, and Black Heaven General kept using their divine sense to search for Life, but they couldn’t capture its aura at all.
 “I sent a Chaotic Fiendcelestial to attack the Heavenly Court. If the court can last for a year, I will give this Chaotic Fiendcelestial to the Heavenly Court. If the Heavenly Court is defeated, the court will surrender to me!”
 Life smiled disdainfully. The immortals were furious and began to hurl accusations.
 Although they couldn’t see Life, this was the Heavenly Court. How could they allow outsiders to be arrogant?
 Furthermore, the other party was clearly here to find trouble!
 Yi Tian cursed. “Damn it, you’re hiding. Come out and fight me first!”
 Life did not answer them.
  The Evil Heavenly Emperor’s eyes flickered. He did not agree immediately.
 He was puzzled. The other party seemed to be confident in defeating them. Since he was so strong, why didn’t he show himself?
 There was only one possibility!
 Life was not as strong as the Chaotic Fiendcelestial he sent, so he beat around the bush!
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor smiled. “This bet is meaningless. The Heavenly Court no longer thinks highly of the Chaotic Fiendcelestial. How about we change the bet?”
 Life’s voice sounded, “How?”
 “You and I will each send a prodigy at the Primordial Chaos Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm to fight. If you win, the Heavenly Court will belong to you. If you lose, that prodigy will belong to the Heavenly Court. From now on, you are not allowed to disturb the Heavenly Court!”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor had a confident expression before provoking disdainfully, “I wonder if Fellow Daoist Life dares to agree?”


 Life was also filled with confidence.
 He wanted to defeat the Evil Heavenly Emperor and the Heavenly Court’s confidence before subduing them!
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor said proudly, “In ten thousand years. It will be in the Heavenly Court!”
 “Alright! I’ll wait for you for ten thousand years. I want to see what kind of prodigy your Heavenly Court can send!”
 Life laughed wantonly. His laughter became softer and softer as if he was leaving.
  Yi Tian stood up and said, “Looks like the Heavenly Court needs me. Then I…”
 “Tuo’er, this battle will depend on you.”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor interrupted without waiting for Yi Tian to finish.
 Yi Tian’s smile froze.
 The Heavenly Generals couldn’t help but laugh.
 Han Tuo took a step forward and cupped his fists. “I must defeat him even if I die!”
 His eyes were firm and confident.
 He was no longer the same as before!
 All the immortals of the Heavenly Court were the same. Han Tuo used battle after battle to prove himself!
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor nodded in satisfaction and continued to discuss the previous question. The Numinous Palace became noisy again.
 The entire Heavenly Court did not seem to care about Life.
 Ten thousand years passed like smoke. Time passed, but it was also like a dream.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and frowned.
 He was already 350,000 years old. His 300,000th birthday seemed like yesterday.
 Han Jue began to look forward to the system choice reward triggered at 400,000 years old.
 He began to observe the Heavenly Dao.
 He discovered that his providence had increased greatly. Countless Divine Might Heavenly Sage statues and temples had been erected in the Immortal World and the myriad worlds.
 He pinched his fingers to deduce. So the Sages were promoting his legend.
 During a lecture, Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du told the geniuses that the strongest prodigy in the Heavenly Dao was Han Jue, who had attained the Dao at 30,000 years old.
 This matter quickly spread throughout the Immortal World and the myriad worlds after the lecture.
 The reputation of the Hidden Sect also soared!
 Han Jue frowned.
 He did not want to be so high-profile.
 He continued to deduce and learned that it was to suppress Pangu. His brows relaxed.
 It had to be said that this plan was not bad!
 Shifting attention was the best way to suppress someone!
 Han Jue discovered that Li Xuan’ao was rushing towards the Hundred Peak Immortal River. He would probably arrive in a few hours.
 He moved him into the Daoist temple.
 Li Xuan’ao landed on the ground and was stunned.
 He was still flying at full speed and then appeared in front of Han Jue in a panic.
 Such methods…
 Filled with reverence, Li Xuan’ao hurriedly bowed.
 Every time he saw Han Jue, Li Xuan’ao felt that he was even more unfathomable.
 He had heard Zhou Fan mention before that Han Jue was at least a Great Dao Sage!
 “What is it?” Han Jue asked.
 Li Xuan’ao said, “Zhou Fan and I have already established perfect cooperation. Currently, we have already established 300 teleportation arrays that can directly lead to the Great Dao Tower…”
 He first introduced the recent development of the Hidden Sect and finally said, “Recently, many geniuses who have obtained Pangu’s inheritance have appeared in the Immortal World. These geniuses are all walking the body cultivation path. The Hidden Sect has also taken in a batch of them. I want to use the Hundred Peak Immortal River to capture their hearts.”
  Han Jue said, “Make the arrangements. Bring them along in ten thousand years. You can also choose another batch of outer sect geniuses. There are about a hundred thousand spots.”
 Li Xuan’ao was pleasantly surprised and hurriedly thanked him.
 The Hundred Peak Immortal River was filled with Spirit Qi. Just entering was a huge opportunity!
 Han Jue waved his hand and sent him out.
 The reason why he had opened up 100,000 spots this time was to guard against attacks
 The Immortal World did not lack Immortal Emperors and Deity Realm existences, but it still lacked Zenith Heaven Golden Immortals, Pseudo-Sages. Especially Pseudo-Sages.
 Currently, the personal disciples had already begun to break through to the Pseudo-Sage Realm. The weakest Chang Yue’er was also at the late-stage Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm.
 With Spirit Qi that far exceeded the Heavenly Dao and the lecture of the Great Dao Sage, even a pig had hope of rising with time. Furthermore, the potential of the personal disciples of the Hidden Sect was not bad. There was no lack of peerless geniuses.
 Han Jue started to check his emails.
 The emails over the past ten thousand years were not much different from the past, but he still read them with relish.
 [The Evil Heavenly Emperor sent you a dream. Do you accept?]
 Since Han Jue had nothing to do, he accpeted the dream.
 He entered the dream.
 The scene was a forest outside the Jade Pure Sacred Sect from a long time ago. The sun was just nice, shining down through the cracks in the leaves, landing on Han Jue and the Evil Heavenly Emperor. However, the two of them were no longer the same as before. The Evil Heavenly Emperor smiled. “Do you remember this place?”
 Han Jue said, “Of course I remember.”
 “I didn’t expect you to still remember after so many years.”
 “Actually, it feels like less than a hundred years have passed to me.”
 Hearing Han Jue’s words, the Evil Heavenly Emperor was stunned for a moment before understanding.
 That’s right.
 This kid had always been in seclusion. The things he had experienced might not be as many as what mortals encountered in their lives.
 Han Jue smiled and asked, “Your Majesty, what is it? Just say it. You don’t usually reminisce with me.”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor rolled his eyes and said, “You’re still the same as before. Boring. I indeed have something to tell you. Do you know about Life?”
 Han Jue narrowed his eyes. “I don’t.”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor continued, “Thousands of years ago, Life came to the Heavenly Court and made a bet with me. Both sides will send Primordial Chaos Zenith Heaven Golden Immortals to fight. If the Heavenly Court loses, we will have to submit to Life.”
 Han Jue was surprised. Another bet!
 Why did he like to gamble so much?
 “I plan to send Tuo’er to fight him.” After saying that, the Evil Heavenly Emperor paused for a moment, wanting to see Han Jue’s reaction. Unfortunately, Han Jue’s expression didn’t change, so he couldn’t guess.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor continued, “I want to invite you to take action and capture Life!”
 Han Jue asked, “Isn’t it a duel?”
 Han Jue remained silent.
 He had to go to the Heavenly Court for this battle. He was a little scared.
 Once he went out, it meant danger.
  However, if he rejected, the Evil Heavenly Emperor and Han Tuo would definitely be in danger, just like Li Daokong.
 Han Jue couldn’t guarantee that Life wanted to subdue the Evil Heavenly Emperor and Han Tuo. What if they died?
 It would be fine if Han Jue was really weak. He would be helpless.
 But he was already very powerful!
 The Chaotic Deities had no reason to deal with him for the time being. As for the Chaotic Deities, even if he couldn’t defeat them, he could still escape.
 In an instant, Han Jue thought of countless possibilities.
 He said, “Alright!”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor was touched. He knew Han Jue’s personality. He didn’t expect him to immediately agree without hesitation.
