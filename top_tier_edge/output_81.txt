 All the mighty figures and the geniuses of the Ten Absolutes in the hall understood that the Ultimate God of Punishment was saying that the world below the bottom of the Chaos would threaten the Chaos!
 The Chaos looked peaceful, but there was a huge danger hidden beneath it!
 Dao Sovereign frowned. He didn’t expect the Ultimate God of Punishment to know of the existence of the Consciousnessless Great Dao World. Under such circumstances, the Number One Deity still wanted to rope in the Chaotic geniuses. It was undoubtedly a fool’s dream.
 The Ultimate God of Punishment spread this matter intending to unite the Chaotic geniuses.
 The mighty figures in the hall also discussed.
 “I’ve indeed heard that the bottom of the Chaos was once a prison.”
 “The world below is not smaller than the Chaos. Could there be many mighty figures hidden there?”
 “What are you afraid of? To be suppressed by the Chaos, his strength is definitely far inferior to it.”
 “That’s right. Actually, he means to prevent trouble.”
 “I think it’s good. The Chaos is vast. There’s no need for us to fight. You can go underground if you want to fight for resources.”
 The mighty figures were not afraid after hearing this. Instead, they began to praise the Ultimate God of Punishment.
 The Ultimate God of Punishment made the rules meaningful, and the intention of the Chaotic Assembly also sublimated.
 Han Huang looked at the other nine geniuses and said, “At that time, we’ll split into one-on-one battles. We won’t bully others with numbers.”
 Dao Sovereign, Murong Qi, Guan Bubai, and the Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial nodded. They had expressed their stance in public.
 The other five geniuses nodded. At this point, they all understood each other’s strengths. There was no need to pretend to be arrogant and attract trouble.
 For a time, the atmosphere in the hall softened.
 The battle of the Ten Absolutes was no longer a battle between geniuses. They might encounter experts from the world below.
 While the mighty figures were discussing, the Ultimate God of Punishment also explained to Han Jue with a voice transmission.
 Of course, this rule was still beneficial to the Hidden Sect. The Ultimate God of Punishment killed two birds with one stone. Not only did he give Han Jue face, but he also guarded against the underground world.
 Han Jue had no objections. He also wanted to see the Consciousnessless Great Dao World’s foundation.
 “Master, do you feel it?” the Ultimate God of Punishment asked with a voice transmission again.
 Han Jue was puzzled, but he didn’t ask. Instead, he observed the bottom of the Chaos.
 as
 From the Consciousnessless Great Dao World?
 The Chaotic Consciousness could not sit still anymore?
 Han Jue was filled with anticipation.
 He was looking forward to the battle between the Chaotic Consciousness and the Ninth Chaos.
 As for the Chaos, he couldn’t be bothered.
 What a joke. The value of the Ninth Chaos and the Chaotic Consciousness were a hundred times different. How could the Chaotic Consciousness defeat the Ninth Chaos? If the Ninth Chaos was not destroyed, the Chaos would not die.
 The Ultimate God of Punishment sent a voice transmission, “If there’s really an existence below that we can’t defeat…”
 Han Jue nodded slightly and didn’t say anything
 Han Jue naturally wouldn’t deal with the Chaotic Consciousness, but it was fine if it was an existence below the Chaotic Consciousness.
 Although the Chaotic Consciousness tried to rope him in, Han Jue liked the Ninth Chaos more.
 The Ninth Chaos was like a mighty figure. He usually didn’t care about the Chaos and was busy cultivating. The Ninth Chaos was the earliest and most experienced Dao Creator.
 From the looks of it, the Chaotic Consciousness was inferior to the Ninth Chaos.
 As for the Ninth Chaos, Han Jue didn’t really believe it. If not for the Dao Field, the Ninth Chaos would definitely eliminate him.
 The Ten Absolute geniuses meditated and began to cultivate and recover.
 The Ultimate God of Punishment did not care about the mysterious Spirit Qi, as if waiting for the Consciousnessless Great Dao World to take the bait.
 Unfortunately, he didn’t know what he was facing.
 Han Jue didn’t remind him. If he knew, he wouldn’t dare to do it.
 There was no need to expose many things. The Ultimate God of Punishment’s role was only to stabilize the Chaos and delay the Consciousnessless Great Dao World.
 The Chaos and the Consciousnessless Great Dao World were nothing in Han Jue’s eyes.
 He cared more about the Ultimate Origin World.
 A month later.
 The Ultimate God of Punishment left with the Ten Absolutes. The other mighty figures continued to wait in the hall. The Ultimate God of Punishment’s clone was also in the hall, making it convenient for him to cast a spell and let the Ten Absolute City watch the battle.
 Dao Sovereign was very nervous along the way. He had received the Number One Deity’s favor and made a fake promise. Would he be exposed if he bumped into him?
 Guan Bubai was looking forward to it. He smiled proudly and asked, “Do you think we will encounter the geniuses of the underground world?”
 The Great Heavenly God King snorted. “How can there be prodigies in the wilderness? Even if they are talented, they are still worms. It’s not surprising.”
 Dao Sovereign thought to himself, “There are indeed no geniuses, but I didn’t see any worms.”
 The four of them had stayed in the Consciousnessless Great Dao World for millions of years. Other than the vengeful spirits and the Number One Deity, they had really not encountered any living beings.
 He thought that the Consciousnessless Great Dao World was barren and there were no living beings at all.
 However, the Number One Deity indeed intended to overturn the Chaos.
 The ten geniuses began to chat and get to know each other. Before that, they had cold expressions and treated each other like enemies.
 Soon, the Ultimate God of Punishment brought them to the ground. In front of them was a bottomless black hole.
 The group jumped in.
 Dao Sovereign knew that something was wrong. The Ultimate God of Punishment had really discovered the entrance to the Consciousnessless Great Dao World.
 He had still been hoping that the Ultimate God of Punishment had not discovered the true Consciousnessless Great Dao World.
 After entering the world, the ten geniuses began to look around, their Sage Sense sweeping across.
 The Ultimate God of Punishment stood above the clouds and cast a spell at the same time as his clone in the hall, transmitting the scene in front of him into the hall. Not only the hall, but the sky above Ten Absolute City also appeared.
 All the living beings in the city were excited, knowing that the Eternal Peak battle was about to begin.
 “Are they really going to fight a chaotic battle?”
 “Then the Hidden Sect is going to win.”
 “Tsk tsk, why would the other factions agree? Are they really afraid of the Divine Might Heavenly Sage?”
 “That’s right. If they tolerate it now, won’t the geniuses of the Hidden Sect take the Eternal Peak of the Chaotic Assembly in the future?”
 “Ridiculous, ridiculous.”
 “You useless birds should stop chirping. What if you can’t bear it? Do you want to fall out with the Divine Might Heavenly Sage?”
 In the Consciousnessless Great Dao World.
 The ground was desolate and endless. The sky was covered in dark clouds, and faint thunder could be heard.
 The Ten Absolute geniuses did not delay and quickly dispersed.
 Guan Bubai cursed. “It’s time to fight! Let’s fight for victory first. Just kill them if any worms really attack!”
 Han Huang looked at Formless World and said, “Come, I’ll defeat you first!”


 Formless World naturally did not refuse Han Huang’s challenge. They were all peerless geniuses who wanted to reach the peak of the world, so they naturally would not avoid it.
 The other geniuses also began to find opponents.
 Dao Sovereign challenged Huang Zuntian.
 Guan Bubai challenged the Great Heavenly God King.
 Murong Qi challenged the Universe Sage King.
 The Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial fought Zhou Song’s Great Dao Heaven.
 This lineup reversed the spectators’ opinion at Ten Absolute City, and they began to praise the Hidden Sect.
 They could have ganged up, but they insisted on fighting one-on-one.
 This was integrity!
 “As expected of the Hidden Sect!”
 “Who said that the Hidden Sect is suppressing others?”
 “How powerful is the Divine Might Heavenly Sage? Does he need such a method?”
 “Tsk tsk, it must have been arranged by the Heavenly Sage. Actually, it’s not the Hidden Sect’s fault. Who asked their geniuses to be so strong? In my opinion, the Heavenly Sage still cares too much about his reputation. If it were me, I would directly make my disciple the Eternal Peak!”
 “This is going to be good. But what is thi place? It can actually withstand the Dharmic powers of ten peerless geniuses?”
 Dao Sovereign used the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority and summoned the Chaotic River of Destiny. The river meandered and wrapped around his body, covering ten million miles of land, forcing the other geniuses to retreat. The Ultimate God of Punishment also split the sky into five pieces, corresponding to five battlefields.
 Huang Zuntian thought to himself, Actually, I’m also from the Hidden Sect. We’re all on the same side.
 However, it was not appropriate. Currently, Master had no intention of revealing his cards. In that case, he had to continue acting. The more he acted, the better!
 “Great Dao Providence Divine Authority? It’s indeed impressive, but you have it, and so do
 I!”
 Huang Zuntian leaped and laughed wantonly. He opened his arms, and the black patterns on his forehead quickly turned into a black aura that enveloped his entire body.
 In the courtyard of Ten Absolute City.
 Azure Heaven Mystic’s expression turned ugly. Including him, there were already three existences who had grasped the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority!
 Azure Heaven Mystic was furious.
 Dao Sovereign was also stunned. He didn’t expect Huang Zuntian to also control the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority.
 Huang Zuntian’s eyes suddenly turned black. His crown shattered and his long hair fluttered as if he was possessed by the Devil Master. A terrifying aura erupted, moving Dao Sovereign.
 This aura was stronger than all the geniuses Dao Sovereign had encountered before! They were clearly not on the same level!
 “Very good! This is more satisfying!”
 Dao Sovereign laughed loudly. Shadows rushed out from the Chaotic River of Destiny. They were experts of the past and present, all warlike.
 On the other side, the other geniuses also fought angrily. The ground of the Consciousnessless Great Dao World shook violently. The ground kept shattering, as if the end of the world had arrived!
 Han Huang and Formless World fought with their bodies. Both sides had Dharmic powers. They were like two beams of light that constantly moved and expanded in the world. They were fearless. Wherever they passed, all existences were reduced to dust. Even the sky was torn apart by sinister spatial cracks.
 The battle between the two was the most eye-catching. Both sides had outstanding looks and temperament among the geniuses. Their strength was even more so. Along the way, the two of them were domineering and unstoppable.
 An invincible person fought another invincible person!
 Han Huang’s aura was like a rainbow. He kept using the Divine Might Great Heaven Palm, causing the world to collapse and the clouds to tear apart like smoke.
 Formless World’s robes fluttered as thirty-six jade beads of different colors surrounded him. It was as if he was wrapped in seven-colored light. Facing the domineering Han Huang, he was calm and could attack while dodging the Mystical Power.
 If Han Huang was the invincible War God, Formless World would be more like an emperor who ruled the gods. His every move had the vast aura of an emperor, as if he could resolve all the Dao techniques in the world.
 The battles between Guan Bubai, the Great Heavenly God King, Murong Qi, the Universe Sage King, the Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial, and Zhou Song’s Great Dao Heaven were also difficult to determine.
 In the hall.
 Han Jue watched with relish, while Han Ling was a little nervous.
 “Father, this Formless World is so powerful. Can Second Brother avenge Eldest Brother and the others?” Han Ling asked with a voice transmission. She couldn’t let the mighty figures hear this lest they thought too much.
 Han Jue replied, “Formless World is indeed impressive, but it’s not enough to defeat your second brother.”
 What a joke. The Primordial Fiendcelestial had a greater origin than the Formless Transcendent Deity. How could he lose to its successor!
 Formless World clearly still had hidden methods, but so did Han Huang. Until now, Han Huang had not used the power of the Primordial Fiendcelestial.
 As for the others, Han Jue felt that they had no hope.
 Unless Formless World perished with Han Huang and gave others a chance to benefit.
 The scene of the ten extreme geniuses fighting with all their might was indeed spectacular. It far exceeded all the previous battles. Seeing this, everyone in Ten Absolute City exclaimed. Some living beings even shouted the name of the prodigy they worshiped.
 At this moment…
 In the courtyard.
 Hearing this, Azure Heaven Mystic subconsciously looked around. Everyone was watching the battle and no one summoned him.
 No!
 Voice transmission?
 Azure Heaven Mystic frowned. He was about to ignore it when he discovered that the Dharmic powers in his body had suddenly frozen.
 His expression changed. Just as he was about to speak, his expression returned to normal and his eyes became extremely empty.
 He turned around and left quietly.
 Zhao Shuangquan glanced at him and thought that he was agitated, so he did not care and continued watching.
 Ji Xianshen noticed his departure. He followed him after hesitating for a moment.
 No matter what, he had brought Azure Heaven Mystic here. Although they were not master and disciple anymore, their relationship was still there.
 Originally, Ji Xianshen thought that Azure Heaven Mystic had only been agitated and wanted to go back and rest. He did not expect him to leave the city directly.
 Ji Xianshen suddenly realized that something was wrong
 “Although Azure Heaven Mystic is arrogant, he won’t forcefully enter the eternal battlefield. What’s going on?”
 Ji Xianshen frowned. He hesitated for a moment but still decided to follow.
 Boom
 Han Huang descended from the sky and collapsed an area of billions of kilometers. Countless rocks rose and the Formless World’s figure flashed, constantly rising into the sky and leaving his opponent behind.
 Han Huang looked up and mocked. “How long are you going to hide?”
 Formless World looked down at him and said, “I’m looking at your limit. It’s nothing much. Since you can’t wait, prepare to be eliminated!”
 The 36 jade beads suddenly gathered and condensed into a seven-colored sword. Formless World raised the sword and slashed. Sword Qi swept through the world.
 Han Huang did not dodge. He raised his palm and struck. The Divine Might Great Heaven Palm directly split his sword Qi into two.
 However, the remaining two sword Qi shattered, turning into countless sword Qi that descended from the sky and bombarded the ground.
 Han Huang attacked with both palms, scattering the sword Qi one after another. He soared into the sky as he stared at his opponent.
 Formless World was stunned. For some reason, Han Huang’s gaze made his heart palpitate.
 “Impossible! I’m invincible… Even the supreme existence who transcended the Chaos said that…”
 Formless World’s eyes became firm as he revealed a strange smile.


 Formless World hung in the sky. He drew a circle with his right hand. In an instant, the sky behind him suddenly changed, as if another world was connected to the Consciousnessless Great Dao World.
 This world was magnificent. The peaks were gathered and the mountains were steep. They were like huge swords piercing the sky. The world was overturned and looked even more domineering. Even the other geniuses of the Ten Absolutes who were fighting in the distance looked over.
 Other geniuses had already used the power of the Great World in the previous battles, but it was not as spectacular as this. Their auras were worlds apart.
 !!
 The spectators in Ten Absolute City were also shocked.
 Han Huang didn’t panic at all as he faced the Formless World’s Great World. Purple Qi surrounded his body. Only Han Jue could understand that it was nebulous Primordial Qi.
 This aura was enough to sweep through all the geniuses of the Chaotic Assembly!
 Who was he?
 Formless World was shocked. He had seen many Chaotic Fiendcelestials, but he had never felt such pressure.
 Han Huang leaped and suddenly arrived in front of Formless World. Their eyes met, and they were less than twenty centimeters apart.
 Formless World felt the surrounding space freeze. He couldn’t move in the slightest.
 Han Huang’s eyes emitted a purple light that swept past Formless World’s ears and directly pierced through its Great World. The Great World scattered like a mirror, and the remaining clouds in the world were swept up by the wind and torn apart, as if the sky had shattered.
 Formless World’s figure trembled and suddenly vanished.
 Han Huang turned around and saw him appear on the horizon. Black runes spun behind him. These black runes looked like a face, and a face that could not be seen made one’s blood run cold.
 Han Jue frowned.
 This power…
 He was cheating!
 The Formless Transcendent Deity did not care about morals!
 Formless World’s Mystical Power was similar to the Invocation Mystical Power. The power clearly did not belong to him.
 However, only Han Jue could understand that the power of the Dao Creator was unknown to the Great Dao Sages and the Great Dao Supremes. However, Han Jue was above all living beings in the Chaos and could sense that the level of this power was higher than that of the Great Dao Supreme Realm. What kind of power was it if it was not the Dao Creator’s?
 “This is the Formless Transcendent Technique. You’ve lost!” Formless World said coldly as he looked down at Han Huang.
 Han Huang said disdainfully, “How dare you use such tricks!”
 He attacked Formless World again.
 Above the clouds.
 The Ultimate God of Punishment looked at Formless World and frowned.
 “What’s going on? His Mystical Power actually makes me uneasy. Something’s wrong…”
 The Ultimate God of Punishment was puzzled. He had suspected that a power outside the Chaos had infiltrated Ten Absolute City. Could Formless World be one of them?
 He looked at Formless World with a subtle gaze.
 At this moment, he suddenly felt something and turned around.
 The Ultimate God of Punishment remembered Azure Heaven Mystic, a relatively outstanding prodigy in this Chaotic Assembly.
 Why was this fellow here? Could it be that he wanted to forcefully join the Ten Absolutes Battle and make a name for himself?
 Something was wrong!
 Wouldn’t he be courting death if he entered with his cultivation level?
 The Ultimate God of Punishment’s expression changed slightly.
 The fact that Azure Heaven Mystic could absorb the Spirit Qi of this world meant that he was related to this world. At least, not the Ultimate God of Punishment.
 Apart from Formless World, there was also the Azure Heaven Mystic…
 How many forces had been planted in the Chaotic Assembly?
 The Ultimate God of Punishment was about to take action when a voice entered his ears, causing him to pause.
 The battle of the Ten Absolutes lasted for several days. The first prodigy to be eliminated was Dao Sovereign.
 Dao Sovereign was defeated by Huang Zuntian and almost died. Fortunately, the Ultimate God of Punishment took action and sent him back to Ten Absolute City.
 “It’s fine. The other party is the Life Lord, a famous figure. Even Li Daokong and Ancestor Xitian work under him.”
 Fang Liang smiled, his eyes filled with envy.
 He had not even entered the top ten thousand. Dao Sovereign’s achievements were already unimaginable in his opinion.
 Dao Sovereign was even more displeased. He was about to curse when he suddenly fell silent.
 The Number One Deity’s voice entered his ears. His originally depressed mood became nervous.
 What happened?
 Didn’t he say that he only needed to rope in geniuses in this Chaotic Assembly?
 Dao Sovereign thought the Number One Deity clearly wanted to attack Ten Absolute City.
 He wasn’t the only one. Zhao Xuanyuan, Jiang Yi, and Lao Dan also revealed ugly expressions. They had probably received the same voice transmission.
 “Aren’t we pretending?”
 “As expected, the Number One Deity has ill intentions. But what are we afraid of with Master around?”
 “That’s right. What will happen to the Hidden Sect if we leave just like that?”
 “How can we really betray the sect?” “Although the Number One Deity mentioned Sect Master, Sect Master didn’t instruct us to act recklessly.”
 The three of them quickly discussed and decided to stay.
 Dao Sovereign called Han Jue in his mind. With the latter’s cultivation, he believed that Han Jue could sense it.
 Indeed.
 Not long after, Han Jue’s voice sounded in Dao Sovereign’s ears, “What is it? Tell me in my dreams.”
 Dao Sovereign immediately meditated and started dreaming
 In the dream.
 Dao Sovereign told him everything.
 Han Jue smiled upon learning that the Number One Deity had used his name to trick his disciple.
 He despised the Chaotic Consciousness even more.
 Such methods were really not presentable.
 “I understand. Stay in the city for the time being. I’ll take care of everything,” Han Jue said softly.
 The dream shattered. Han Jue continued to watch the battle on the surface and asked in his mind, “Can I overturn the Chaos if I help the Chaotic Consciousness?”
 (1 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?)
 Continue!
 [No]
 Tsk tsk, how decisive!
 It seemed that the Chaotic Consciousness had also underestimated the Ninth Chaos’ power.
 Since it was a dead end, Han Jue naturally couldn’t leave.
 Although the Chaotic Consciousness had roped him in, it had plotted against his disciple.
 The Ninth Chaos at least promised to ensure the Heavenly Dao’s safety.
 The other Dao Creators would be found by the Ninth Chaos once they attained the Dao. Then, their Great Dao World would be suppressed. However, Han Jue had a Dao Field that could protect him.
 


 Dao Sovereign and the other three continued to watch the battle after they decided not to leave Ten Absolute City. They weren’t even worried about danger.
 Number One Deity couldn’t directly destroy Ten Absolute City no matter how terrifying his conspiracy was.
 Most of the top forces in the entire Chaos were gathered in Ten Absolute City. It was not enough even if the Number One Deity brought his Destruction Authority Generals with him!
 After Dao Sovereign lost, Universe Sage King followed suit.
 !!
 The battle between Formless World and Han Huang was still at a stalemate. Both sides were ferocious, causing the spectators to guess that they might perish together in Ten Ultimate City.
 Instead, Huang Zuntian, who had defeated Dao Sovereign, began to rest. Murong Qi, who had defeated the Universe Sage King, was not in a hurry to attack.
 There were still five people left, after all. They couldn’t fight one-on-one. A chaotic battle was inevitable, especially after the battle.
 Formless World used the Formless Transcendent Technique to always have the upper hand, but he could not defeat Han Huang. This caused his supporters to sweat.
 The world collapsed and rumbled. Formless World repelled Han Huang again, but he still did not gain the upper hand.
 He even felt like he was being played.
 He became even more furious.
 The next day, the Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial defeated Zhou Song’s Great Dao Heaven, but he was also severely injured and could not recover in a short period of time. That day, Guan Bubai was defeated by the Great Heavenly God King, and the Ultimate God of Punishment sent him back to Ten Absolute City.
 Similarly, the Great Heavenly God King was also severely injured and began to meditate and recuperate.
 Only Formless World and Han Huang were still fighting
 The battle continued.
 Days passed.
 Formless World and Han Huang were still fighting. The two of them kept moving the battlefield and crazily destroyed the ground along the way.
 Huang Zuntian, Murong Qi, the Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial, and the Great Heavenly God King were still waiting.
 Murong Qi and the Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial looked at each other and stood
 up.
 At this moment, the Great Heavenly God King’s voice sounded, “Three of you, why don’t you enter the battle and defeat Formless World? I can tell that Han Huang is not his match. If we fight again, can one of us be Han Huang’s or Formless World’s match?”
 “If Han Huang is defeated during our battle and Formless World begins to recuperate, wouldn’t that be even worse?”
 Murong Qi and the Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial were silent.
 The Great Heavenly God King’s goal was Formless World. They would naturally be unwilling to deal with Han Huang.
 At this point, they could actually tell that Han Huang was really not Formless World’s match.
 as
 What would happen if they continued to fight one-on-one and Han Huang lost?
 Huang Zuntian’s voice floated over, “Actually, one-on-one is enough. In the Chaos, it’s impossible to survive and fight one-on-one forever. Most of the time, it’s a chaotic battle or a few against many. Instead of considering here, let’s all participate in the battle. I think the cultivators of Ten Absolute City are also waiting for this scene.”
 Murong Qi and the Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial looked at each other and saw the intention in each other’s eyes.
 That was indeed the case!
 Just like that, the four peerless geniuses soared into the sky and rushed towards Han Huang and Formless World.
 The Ultimate God of Punishment frowned as he watched the battle from afar.
 The Ultimate God of Punishment fell into a dilemma.
 He recalled the voice’s words and felt extremely conflicted.
 A cry of surprise sounded in Ten Absolute City because the six geniuses had begun to fight!
 “This should have happened long ago. It’s too boring to fight one-on-one!”
 “Who gave the Hidden Sect pressure previously?”
 “The true Eternal Peak should be able to win even when facing a dangerous situation where they are outnumbered, just like the Divine Might Heavenly Sage!”
 “Formless World is in danger!”
 The six prodigies fought together and separately. Their Mystical Powers were violent and they fought whoever they saw. The scene was extremely chaotic. Even if Formless World was caught off guard, fortunately, there was the Formless Transcendent Technique to protect him.
 Murong Qi and the Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial were very straightforward. They even attacked Han Huang. Not only was Han Huang not angry, but he was even more excited.
 “Very good! Awesome!”
 Han Huang laughed wantonly. He took out a divine weapon and attacked the center of the battlefield next.
 While the six geniuses were immersed in the chaotic battle, the Number One Deity suddenly appeared behind Azure Heaven Mystic.
 The Ultimate God of Punishment glanced at him, but he did not stop him.
 The Number One Deity directly fused into Azure Heaven Mystic’s back. Immediately after, he opened his eyes and stood up, walking towards the entrance to the Chaos.
 Thunderclouds rumbled in the sky.
 Soon, he jumped into the black hole and disappeared.
 On the other side.
 In the hall.
 The Ultimate God of Punishment’s clone sent a voice transmission to Han Jue, telling him about his agreement with the Number One Deity.
 Previously, the Number One Deity had contacted him and said he hoped he could turn a blind eye. He wanted to overthrow the Chaos and not hurt it.
 Han Jue was speechless.
 Why was this fellow so gullible?
 After listening for a while, Han Jue understood that the Number One Deity had mentioned the Primordial Ancestor God.
 The Primordial Ancestor God had also suppressed the Number One Deity in the past. Both sides empathized and learned that there was a higher existence behind the Chaotic Will. This leader of the Divine Spirits could not sit still. Furthermore, the Number One Deity said that the Divine Might Heavenly Sage, Laozi, and the other mighty figures had already formed an alliance, so he tacitly agreed.
 The Number One Deity mentioned Dao Sovereign and the other two as well as Azure Heaven Mystic, saying that it was precisely because the Divine Might Heavenly Sage agreed that he could give the inheritance to the four of them. Therefore, the Ultimate God of Punishment believed him and didn’t ask Han Jue, afraid that it would delay his plan.
 “If this fails, I’ll say that you don’t know anything. I’ll take full responsibility. If you succeed, you can cultivate well and there won’t be any dark clouds above your head.” The Ultimate God of Punishment sent a voice transmission.
 Han Jue’s opinion of the Ultimate God of Punishment rose.
 How sensible.
 The Ultimate God of Punishment’s clone immediately split into a soul. The two of them moved very quickly. With their cultivation levels, they could do it without anyone noticing.
 Han Jue continued to watch the battle after putting away the Ultimate God of Punishment’s soul.
 The next day, he felt a spatial fluctuation at the edge of Ten Absolute City. Someone was using a formation to trap the entire city.
 The Number One Deity’s goal was to trap Ten Absolute City and sever the Supreme Rules.
 Ten Absolute City had gathered 90% of the mighty figures of the Chaos. As long as they were trapped, there would be no obstruction when the Number One Deity attacked the Supreme Rules.
 As for the Ninth Chaos, even if it revived, two transcendent existences would stop it!
 


The mighty figures in the hall also sensed it when Ten Absolute City was isolated by a mysterious array formation.
They looked at the Ultimate God of Punishment and Han Jue.
The Ultimate God of Punishment said, “Continue watching.”
The mighty figures could only suppress their uneasiness and continue watching the battle. However, they were secretly sending voice transmissions and asking their subordinates to investigate the situation.
Soon, the cultivators in Ten Absolute City also sensed that something was wrong.
“What’s going on? I can’t leave the city!”
“Could it be that they’re afraid that we’ll interfere with the Eternal Peak battle?”
“That’s not right. I can’t sense the aura of the battlefield at all. This means that it’s not at the bottom of the Chaos!”
“The Ultimate God didn’t speak. Nothing should happen, right?”
“Don’t panic. 90% of the major factions of the Chaos are gathered here. How can anything happen?”
In the courtyard.
The geniuses of the Hidden Sect also began to discuss this matter.
The Black Hell Chicken shouted, “What are you afraid of? With Master around, nothing will happen even if the sky collapses.”
Han Tuo and the four Divine Punishers looked at each other. They smelled danger. This was their intuition after countless years of experience in battles.
Li Xuan’ao said, “The battle at the top of the world is still ongoing, which means that it’s fine. Otherwise, the battle will be stopped.” The others nodded and focused on the sky.
Formless World, Han Huang, Huang Zuntian, Murong Qi, the Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial, and the Great Heavenly God King were still fighting. Countless Mystical Powers were being hurled around. The scene was extremely chaotic, but it was also filled with visual shock. The cultivators in Ten Absolute City watched with relish.
This chaotic battle was too passionate and entertaining. It far exceeded the previous one-on-one battles.
At the same time.
Azure Heaven Mystic, who had been possessed by the Number One Deity, arrived in front of the Ten Absolute City. He raised his right hand, and an endless black aura rushed out from his palm and soared into the sky. It pierced through layers of space through the Chaotic Void. It surpassed the three thousand Great Dao and arrived under the Seven Supreme Rules.
The black aura condensed into a black pillar of light. Figures rushed out of the black pillar of light. They were the Destruction Authority Generals.
Soon, the number of Destruction Authority Generals exceeded 100,000. They attacked the Seven Supreme Rules crazily. The new Destruction Authority Generals also attacked. The Seven Supreme Rules trembled violently as the three thousand Great Dao fell into chaos.
In the hall.
Many mighty figures looked up. They all panicked when they saw the Destruction Authority Generals attacking the Supreme Rules.
Their
power was based on the Chaos. If the Chaos collapsed, even if they could live, they would lose their power and status.
“Ultimate God! Heavenly Sage! Look at the
Supreme Rules!”
“Could it be that the worlds below the Chaos
have begun to take action?”
“What should we do?”
“Ultimate God, why aren’t you doing
anything!”
The other Great Dao Sages began to panic even though they could not see the situation above the three thousand Great Dao.
The Ultimate God of Punishment’s clone said, “Go and protect the Supreme Rules!” With that said, the Great Dao Supremes
quickly vanished.
However, they were stopped above Ten Absolute City, unable to break through the
array formation.
They panicked even more and used their full strength to break the formation. For a time, the entire Ten Absolute City began to shake violently. All the living beings looked up and saw the mighty figures trying to break the formation. They immediately realized that
something was wrong with the formation! For a time, there were all sorts of guesses in Ten Absolute City. Some even cogitated that the Ultimate God of Punishment wanted to harm them.
Dao Sovereign and the other three were silent. They didn’t explain to their fellow disciples and watched as the wind blew and the clouds surged.
A Great Dao Supreme returned to the hall and said anxiously, “Heavenly Sage! Ultimate God! Please do something, or we won’t be able to break through the formation!”
He followed and prepared to act.
Han Jue hesitated.
Should he act?
Would it be pretentious? After all, the Ninth Chaos definitely knew his strength. Although the array formation outside was strong, even the Nine-Headed Divine Spirit could easily break it.
No!
In the Ninth Chaos’ opinion, he should not be able to defeat the Nine-Headed Divine Spirit.
Then, let’s act.
Han Jue stood up and said, “Ling’er, stay here and don’t walk around.”
He followed them to the sky above Ten Absolute City. The mighty figures worked together to break the array formation, but
they couldn’t move it at all. Han Jue discovered that this array formation was indeed impressive. It was very difficult to break through with a Great Dao Supreme’s strength. At the very least, one had to be half-step into the Creator Realm to have hope. As expected of the Chaotic Consciousness.
He carefully controlled his Dharmic powers and waved his palm.
On the other side, in the Consciousnessless Great Dao World.
Huang Zuntian’s expression changed drastically. His Great Dao Providence Divine Authority quickly dissipated, causing his
Dharmic powers to decrease.
The Great Heavenly God King found an opportunity and shot out a bone truncheon. It pierced through Huang Zuntian’s chest and nailed him to the ground. Immediately after, bone weapons rushed out from the bone truncheon and surrounded Huang Zuntian. They raised their weapons and stabbed them into the ground. Ghost aura spread and formed a sealing formation, preventing
Huang Zuntian from moving. “Damn it… Why is this happening…” Huang Zuntian gritted his teeth, not understanding why the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority had suddenly failed.
The Great Heavenly God King did not pity him. He appeared above him and gathered all his Dharmic powers in his palm, preparing to
end Huang Zuntian.
The Ultimate God of Punishment immediately sent Huang Zuntian out, indicating that he
was eliminated.
At this moment, the attention of the entire Ten Absolute City was already attracted by the mighty figures attacking the array formation. Huang Zuntian’s elimination only disappointed his supporters.
Azure Heaven Mystic stood outside Ten Absolute City looking at the mighty figures above with a mocking expression.
He said loudly, “Everyone, show yourselves!” With that said, thunderclouds suddenly appeared and enveloped the entire bottom of the Chaos. The mighty figures above Ten Absolute City stopped, including Han Jue. They looked up and saw a faintly discernible mighty figure appear in the thundercloud. It was even larger than the entire Ten Absolute City. The part of its body that was revealed was enough to make people despair.
Han Jue immediately used the simulation trial to check his surroundings.
[Formless Transcendent Deity: Early-stage
Dao Creator, Chaotic Deity, Above Order,
Transcends Everything.]
It was him!
The Evil Heavenly Emperor’s backer! Han Jue showed a frown.
The aura emitted by the Formless Transcendent Deity was extremely terrifying.
At least, Han Jue felt that he was not his
match.
“Open!”
An extremely dignified shout resounded through the world. Immediately after, the entire bottom of the Chaos began to shake as the sky rose higher and higher.
To be precise, the bottom of the Chaos was decreasing!
The Ultimate God’s clone was moved. He turned to look at Azure Heaven Mystic outside
the city and asked with a voice transmission, “Fellow Daoist, what are you doing? Didn’t
you say that you wouldn’t hurt the living beings in Ten Absolute City?”
Azure Heaven Mystic replied, “Sorry, I have to wipe out all living beings if I want to truly
destroy the Chaos!”
The Ultimate God of Punishment’s expression
changed drastically. He couldn’t be bothered to scold him and sent a voice transmission to
Han Jue.
Han Jue was not surprised.
Very good. Since you’re so cruel, don’t blame
me for being heartless!
the Ten Absolute Geniuses below. Then, he waited for the Ninth Chaos to make a move.
Dao Creator VS Dao Creator.
Meanwhile, he had to face the mysterious
Number One Deity!
