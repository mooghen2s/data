 Han Huang frowned and revealed an impatient expression.
 “Then I won’t care about you. You deserve to die if that happens. I won’t be able to take care of you once I start a war with my old enemy!”
 Han Huang snorted and focused on the materials in front of him. As he kept casting
 spells, the materials began to fuse. He used his Dharmic powers as a furnace to refine something.
 !!
 The woman in the immortal dress did not say anything else. Instead, she flew to the meteor beside her and meditated.
 Peace returned to the void.
 Han Huang was focused on what he was doing, and the woman in the immortal dress looked at him from time to time, her heart fluttering.
 Time passed quickly.
 A million years passed.
 The two of them sat here. Han Huang no longer refined Dharma treasures and just meditated.
 Until one day.
 He suddenly opened his eyes, a ferocious glint in them.
 He stood up and revealed a wild and sinister smile. He muttered, “You’re finally here. You’ve really made me wait!”
 The woman in the immortal dress in the distance opened her eyes and stood up. She asked nervously, “You’re leaving?”
 Han Huang glanced at her and said, “That’s right. I want to fight an extremely strong opponent. Do you want to die? I’ll fulfill your wish. At that time, the aftermath of the battle will turn you into ashes.”
 The woman in the immortal dress bit her lips and did not leave with Han Huang in the end. She looked at Han Huang’s departing figure with a faint expression and sighed slightly. “Why do you dislike me so much? Are you really afraid that I’ll burden you?”
 Han Jue opened his eyes and a sharp look flashed across his eyes.
 The first thing Han Jue did after waking up was to check his emails.

 …
 So many numbers!
 Was the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity
 here?
 Han Jue didn’t sense Han Huang using the Ultimate Origin Power, so he didn’t end his cultivation early. He didn’t expect him to be surrounded.
 He deduced that Huang Zuntian had yet to appear. Now, Han Huang was surrounded by the entire Chaos. In order to help him, Han Ye had also followed him.
 Primordial Fiendcelestial and the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity’s protagonist!
 all living beings, he appeared very stable. He
 by him.
 His battle achievements spread widely in the Chaos, Transcendent, Consciousnessless, and Shi Tian, shocking everyone!
 All living beings saw the birth of an invincible person. He was soaring and unstoppable! Han Jue was relieved. He had not nurtured this kid in vain. He had finally killed his way out.
  The Primordial Fiendcelestial and the Creation Heaven’s Chosen. At the same realm, Han Jue had to make sure Han Huang swept through all enemies.
 “Progenitor, you’re awake. Ancestor Han
 Huang is surrounded. Do you know?” Shan’e asked carefully.
 He was also a Great Dao Sage and could naturally sense and see the chaotic battle. All
 these years, he had not cultivated much and had only been watching the show.
 He wasn’t the only one. Xing Hongxuan and
 the other women were also watching the battle. They were all worried for Han Huang, but they
 were all confident in him now. Han Huang was too strong!
 As expected of the Primordial Fiendcelestial!
 Han Jue smiled. “Of course, I know.” With that, he vanished and arrived at Xing
 Hongxuan’s Daoist temple. At this moment,
 Qingluan’er, Xuan Qingjun, Fairy Xi Xuan, and Chang Yue’er gathered here. A screen of light floated in front of them, revealing Han
 Huang’s figure.
 The vast void was filled with blood Qi and
 corpses. Countless mighty figures rushed out from every corner of the Chaos and attacked Han Huang. One after another, they were like moths rushing to the flame.
 Han Huang was like the Giant God of Creation as he revealed the true body of the Primordial Fiendcelestial. His body was billions of feet tall and his white hair fluttered wantonly. The muscles on his upper body were terrifying and the armor and pants of his lower body were
 already dyed blood-red. His eyes emitted a
 blood light that swept through the Chaos. Countless purple dragons formed by the Primordial Purple Qi coiled around his body
 and resisted countless powerful enemies for him. This scene was really as if Pangu was alive, or even worse!
 Behind Han Huang, Han Ye held the World
 Piercing Divine Origin Bow and shot ten thousand arrows in one star. He was also
 small.
 Han Jue appeared beside Xing Hongxuan, scaring the five women.
 asked curiously.
 Han Jue smiled. “Of course, I’m here to see our son.”
 Chang Yue’er said excitedly, “Junior Han, Huang’er is too strong. There’s also Han Ye. I
 didn’t like him when I saw him in the Chaotic
 ||
 Assembly. He’s too arrogant. I didn’t expect him to dare to help Huang’er.’ The cultivator who attacked Han Huang was at
 Huang. The closest to Han Huang were Great Dao Supremes. Many existences used the power of the Great Dao World to resist, but they were still suppressed by Han Huang.
 that
 Han Jue smiled and said, “Of course. Do you see his bow? That’s a Supreme Treasure surpasses a Chaotic Supreme Treasure. I gave it to him. I’ve never misjudged someone.”
 The Ultimate Killing Star fought with the Primordial Fiendcelestial. It was a beautiful scene. At least to Han Jue, it was quite beautiful.
 Xuan Qingjun asked, “What level is above the Chaotic Supreme Treasure?”
 “An Ultimate Dao Treasure contains unimaginable danger. Han Ye’s bow can
 destroy a Great Dao World. As long as he’s strong enough, he can even shatter the Chaos with an arrow.”
 Han Jue’s reply caused the women to gasp. Such a powerful Supreme Treasure? Qingluan’er sighed. “He’s indeed worthy. The
 descendants of our Han family might not be inferior to your children.”
 Xing Hongxuan, Fairy Xi Xuan, Xuan Qingjun, and Chang Yue’er nodded.
 Han Ye had proved himself in this battle. The
  name of the Killing God had already spread in the Chaos.
 They had already fought for more than a
 even be sensed by the universe of stars. It was unsettling and terrifying.
 “Husband, can Huang’er and Ye’er win?” Xing Hongxuan asked nervously. Although the two of them were very strong, more and more
 enemies came to participate in the battle,
 including cultivators from other Great Dao Worlds.
 At this rate, the situation was not optimistic.
 No matter how strong he was, could he fight
 forever? Han Jue replied, “It depends on their
 willpower.” 


 Han Jue sighed when he saw this.
 The Chaos had developed too quickly in the past hundred million years. It was unknown if it was because the Ninth Chaos was about to break through or because of his influence.
 !!
 Be it the Great Dao Supremes or the Great Dao Sages, the number far exceeded the past eras. Thinking about it carefully, it was all thanks to the Ultimate God of Punishment. He protected the geniuses extremely well and declared that he wouldn’t kill them. In ordinary battles, even if they died, the mighty figures had ways to protect themselves and revive. They were afraid that their mortal enemies would not let them go. The Ultimate God of Punishment’s rule made it so that even if the geniuses died, they could revive.
 The survival rate of geniuses was high. With time, the number of Great Dao Sages and Great Dao Supremes would naturally increase.
 In the past, the Great Dao Sages and the Great Dao Supremes were not top-notch talents. They were all people with brilliant methods and great opportunities. It was just like obtaining the door of the Great Dao that the Great Dao Sages needed to cross. In the past, mighty figures deliberately obstructed Divine Lord Peacock.
 At that time, no matter how talented he was, it would be impossible for him to break through if he was troubled by a mighty figure.
 
 “Li Daokong is really powerful now. I used to think that he was very strong. Now, he has finally grown up. Unfortunately, he no longer belongs to the Hidden Sect.” Xing Hongxuan sighed.
 Chang Yue’er smiled. “Not necessarily. I heard that Li Daokong has killed countless living beings, but he has never touched any Hidden Sect disciple. The entire Life faction is like this. It must be his credit.”
 The women looked at Han Jue.
 Han Jue smiled and said, “Perhaps he still has the Hidden Sect in his heart, but only he knows.”
 Seeing his tone and smile, the women guessed that he was still related to Li Daokong, but they
 did not say it clearly.
 They were no longer the mortals of the past. The higher their cultivation level, the more afraid they were. Sometimes, as long as they spoke, even if there was no one nearby, they could be deduced.
 Li Daokong was not Han Huang’s match. Later, he used the Sword World, a Great Dao World formed by countless forms of swords. The sword might was vast and mighty, causing the swords of the Chaotic Heavens to tremble as if
 they were worshiping the Sword Ancestor.
 “Li Daokong, your sword is stronger than Laozi’s!”
 Han Huang laughed. He was extremely happy
 to see Li Daokong. He had received Li Daokong’s help several times when he wandered the Chaos and had a favorable
 impression of him.
 Li Daokong stepped on the sword light that was a hundred million kilometers long and looked at the insufferably arrogant Primordial Fiendcelestial figure. He sighed and smiled. “Han Huang, you’re really strong. As expected of the son of that existence. But in today’s battle, the Calamity Life Controllers and I won’t
 stop.”
 “I understand. Come, I’m willing to accept the challenge of all living beings. I won’t be
 everything!”
 Han Huang’s laughter was extremely impudent. It echoed in the Chaotic Void and
 spread extremely far.
 The spectators in the distance were all
 convinced.
 “Indeed. If he’s not the Primordial
 Fiendcelestial, who in the Chaos,
 Transcendent, Consciousnessless, and Shi Tian
 Great Dao World is worthy?”
 “Although this fellow is arrogant, he’s indeed
 extremely powerful.”
 “Is there really a huge difference between the Primordial Fiendcelestial and all living
 beings?”
 “It’s fine if it’s Han Huang. Why do I feel that
  Han Huang’s son?”
 “Junior, you’re wrong. Although they share the same origin, they’re not father and son. Han Huang is not the founder of the Han family. No matter how strong Han Huang is, he’s not the illusory Divine Might Heavenly Sage’s match.” “Han Huang is the Divine Might Heavenly Sage’s son. How can the Divine Might Heavenly
 Sage stop him from attaining the Dao? Besides, it’s impossible for the Divine Might Heavenly Sage to care about the Primordial Fiendcelestial’s fake reputation.” All living beings were discussing. At this point,
 Han Huang’s believers and were extremely fanatical.
 Han Jue left after watching for a while, leaving
 the women to continue watching the battle
 excitedly.
 After returning to the Daoist temple, Shan’e was also watching the battle with relish. They were just short of holding a handful of melon
 seeds.
 Shan’e wanted to bow upon seeing him, but Han Jue waved his hand and stopped him. “Continue watching.”
 With that, Han Jue sat on the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus. He closed his eyes and thought.
 How should he use the Creation Heaven’s
 “Forget it. I’ll wait for another ten million
 years. At that time, I’ll draw nine consecutive
 times. Nine is the limit of the Great Dao. It will definitely bring good luck.”
 Han Jue thought silently. At that time, the nine Creation Heaven’s Chosen could form a team, just like the Five Great Divine Punishers in the past. They could be nurtured to represent the
 Nine Great Sages of the Divine Might Heavenly
 Sage.
 Han Jue looked forward to it.
 It was time to add some fun to his boring cultivation years. Han Jue was a little bored after Han Ling left. As for Shan’e, he was not interesting enough. This fellow was too nervous and usually liked to torture noobs in the simulation trial, unlike Han Ling who dared to continue challenging him even if she was defeated.
 …
 Heavenly Court, Numinous Palace.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor smiled as he sat on the Emperor’s throne and listened to the immortals in the hall discuss Han Huang’s reputation.
 The Ultimate Origin Fiendcelestial was also in
 the hall. He had been sent here by Han Ling for a long time. With his potential, he quickly established himself and was now the Heavenly Court’s number one prodigy.
 Hearing Han Huang’s legend, the Ultimate Origin Fiendcelestial couldn’t help but recall the past. He didn’t know how far he was from Han Huang now.
 An old immortal stood up and interrupted the
 discussion. He cupped his hands at the Evil Heavenly Emperor and said, “Your Majesty, this is an era of great conflict. If the Heavenly Court continues to nurture an area without
 fighting, it will definitely fall behind. The legends of the Endless Era have already spread. When the Endless Era arrives, the Chaos will
 split into countless pieces. At that time, every piece will be independent. Unlike now, living beings from various domains can still interact and trade. At that time, different factions will have different providence. It’s impossible for ordinary living beings to enter rashly.” The Evil Heavenly Emperor nodded. “You’re right, but how should the Heavenly Court
 fight? Should we fight for the Primordial Fiendcelestial position or territory?” The old immortal replied, “For territory. No
  one in the Heavenly Court is qualified to fight for the Primordial Fiendcelestial position, and Han Huang is on good terms with the Heavenly
 Court. There’s no need to dispel the friendship. Fighting for territory is the most beneficial. It’s best if it’s a nearby domain. This way, when the Chaos shatters, the various places in the Heavenly Court will be close and easier to
 control.”
 The Ultimate Origin Fiendcelestial immediately said unhappily, “Who said that the Heavenly Court can’t fight for the Primordial Fiendcelestial position?” The old immortal glanced at him and chuckled.
 He did not argue, which infuriated the Ultimate Origin Fiendcelestial even more.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor scanned the expressions of the immortals and said slowly, “I’m related to the Transcendent Great World. I can enter it. At that time, I can obtain a domain
 a hundred times larger than now. What do you
 think?”
 The immortals were in an uproar.
 Transcendent?
 Wasn’t that betraying the Chaos? 


 “Yes, we will definitely be surrounded once it’s announced.”
 “It’s too far from the Heavenly Court.”
 “Your Majesty, you have to consider carefully.” “Yes, once we go to the Transcendent Great World, the relationships the Heavenly Court established in the Chaos will all be gone.”
 !!
 …
 The immortals were excited and fought to dissuade the Evil Heavenly Emperor.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor said, “The existence I know can directly move the Heavenly Court into Transcendence. As for relationships, with that existence, it surpasses all the current Chaotic relationships of the Heavenly Court.”
 Black Heaven General asked, “What about the Divine Might Heavenly Sage?”
 Although the Divine Might Heavenly Sage had not moved for more than a hundred million years, to the existences of the older generation, this was a name that represented the Supreme. His strength back then was even more exaggerated than the current Han Huang.
 The Ultimate Origin Fiendcelestial’s heart was filled with yearning when he heard the Divine Might Heavenly Sage’s name. He had never seen that supreme existence but was already fascinated by him.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor said, “The Divine Might Heavenly Sage doesn’t belong to the Chaos. He protected the Heavenly Dao. Now, he doesn’t even appear in the Heavenly Dao. Don’t you know what this means? Even people as strong as Dao Sovereign, Li Daokong, and Laozi have already established a Great Dao World. Do you think the Divine Might Heavenly Sage didn’t?
 The immortals fell silent.
 The secret of the Great Dao World had spread in the Chaos ever since the end of the first Chaotic Assembly. The fact that the Chaos was the greatest Great Dao World was no longer a secret. This caused all living beings to guess. Could it be that the Chaos was created by a transcendent existence?
 The old immortal who had spoken earlier said, “In that case, we’ll listen to Your Majesty’s arrangements. The entire Heavenly Court will follow Your Majesty to the death!”
 With someone taking the lead, the others naturally followed. The immortals were afraid that if they were slow, they would anger the Evil Heavenly Emperor.
 “Then we’ll go to the Transcendent World!”
 “Perfect. Transcending the savage land requires us immortals to lead.”
 “That’s right, Your Majesty is right.”
 “In the future, it will be an Endless Era. The
 “We should unify the Transcendent World once
 we descend upon it, right?”
 The immortals turned extremely quickly and
 began to discuss how to dominate the
 Transcendent World.
 The Ultimate Origin Fiendcelestial secretly despised them. How hypocritical.
 He looked at the Evil Heavenly Emperor and wanted to say something, but he was afraid that it was not suitable.
 What would happen to him if the Heavenly Court went to the Transcendent World?
 He was only staying in the Heavenly Court for
 the time being. He had always thought of himself as from the Creation Emperor Court.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor saw through his thoughts and said, “The Creation Emperor Court, our ally, will also go to the Transcendent World and support the Heavenly Court.”
 The gods were in an uproar and became even more excited.
 The Creation Emperor Court could be said to be
 the greatest force in the past tens of millions of years. Han Ye was still fighting with Han Huang. His strength shocked the entire Chaos.
 The Ultimate Origin Fiendcelestial was stunned
 and was even more surprised than them.
 Why would the Emperor join the Transcendent
 World?
 Shouldn’t she create her own Great Dao World?
 Time passed quickly for Han Jue.
 [You have obtained a Creation Heaven’s Chosen
 attempt.]
 He first looked at the Chaos. The battle had
 already ended. With Han Huang and Han Ye’s victory, no matter how many factions participated, they were not Han Huang’s match. However, although this battle was over,
 the various factions were still brewing a greater
 attack.
 Han Jue could deduce that the four Great Dao
 Worlds had begun to connect and wanted to
 join forces to deal with Han Huang. As for Primordial Origin and Huang Zuntian, they never appeared, making him feel
 regretful.
 Han Jue thought for a moment and still sent
 Huang Zuntian a dream.
 Although he couldn’t deduce where Huang
 Zuntian was, he could still visit him in his
 dreams.
 In the dream, Huang Zuntian looked extremely
 haggard, but he still asked Han Jue, “So it’s
 you. Long time no see. I’m pursuing a huge opportunity in a mysterious place. Do you want to hear it?”
 Han Jue said, “No.”
 “Greetings, Master!”
 Huang Zuntian knelt down and cupped his
 fists.
 Han Jue said, “You don’t look good. What’s
 wrong?” Huang Zuntian was furious. “That fellow indeed has ill intentions towards me. He has already possessed my body. However, Master,
 Controller. He can’t control my body without my soul.”
 The Calamity Life Controller had such an effect?
 As expected of the Great Dao Providence Divine
 Authority!
 Han Jue said, “As expected of the person I think the most highly of. Your potential might not be as good as Han Huang’s, but cultivation never only depends on potential.” Huang Zuntian was immediately excited and hurriedly thanked Han Jue for his favor.
 Han Jue’s praise was the most important to him. It was even more meaningful than defeating Han Huang. “I’ll preach the Dao to you now and help you
 increase the Dao of Karma so that you can use it later. How about that?” Han Jue asked.
 “Of course. Thank you, Master!” Han Jue didn’t say anything else and immediately started to preach. That day, Han Jue ended the dream.
 He had used the rules of time in the dream. It
 looked like a day, but it had actually been a million years. The Dao techniques accumulated over a million years were extremely huge, but
 to the Great Dao Supreme, they were nothing and could easily withstand it. Han Jue started to check his emails. [Your daughter Han Ling has entered the
 Transcendent Great Dao World and obtained Transcendent Providence.] [Your descendant Han Yao has entered the Transcendent Great Dao World and obtained
 Transcendent Providence.] [Your son Han Huang has entered the
 Transcendent Great Dao World and obtained Transcendent Providence.]
 [Your disciple Dao Sovereign was attacked by a calamity demon] x5920572
 [Your disciple Zhao Xuanyuan…]
 …
 [Your disciple Murong Qi was attacked by a
 calamity demon] x285777
 [Your disciple Ji Xianshen has transmigrated to
 the Chaotic Future. His providence has transformed.]
 [Your daughter Han Qing’er was attacked by a
 mysterious mighty figure and was severely injured.]
 …
 Many people went to the Transcendent World!
 Is the Formless Transcendent Deity poaching from me?
 Han Jue frowned, but something was wrong.
 Han Ling and Han Huang had both gone there. Perhaps they had reached some agreement? He tried to deduce but failed to find out clearly.
 He had no choice but to use the derivation function.
 “I want to know why Han Ling went to the
 Transcendent Great Dao World.”
 [10 trillion years of lifespan will be deducted.
 Do you want to continue?] Continue!
 Han Jue entered the illusion. He opened his eyes to see a blank domain.
 Han Ling, Han Huang, and the Evil Heavenly Emperor stood in front of a mighty figure. This
 World, we are willing to open a space inside and allow you to create your Great Dao World. If you are outside, your Great Dao World will be
 led to the Chaos and eventually be devoured by it. In the Transcendent World, at least there
 will be us blocking it.”
 The Formless Transcendent Deity’s tone was indifferent as if he was talking about something that had nothing to do with him.


 “Hehe, isn’t this equivalent to giving you our Great Dao World? To catch a turtle in a jar?”
 Han Huang smiled faintly, his tone filled with mockery.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor did not speak. He didn’t plan to interrupt in this matter. He let Han Huang and Han Ling judge for themselves. The Formless Transcendent Deity replied, “Every Great Dao World has its own Transcendent Rule. My Transcendent Rule is tolerance. Furthermore, the Great Dao World that has already taken form will fuse with the Chaos and be destroyed together, turning into an Endless Era. In other words, the
 Transcendent World will no longer exist in the future. I’m helping you now because I want to give the Transcendent World a chance and give hope to all living beings.”
 Han Huang frowned.
 Han Ling asked, “Will living beings die if the Great Dao World fuses?”
 Han Ling frowned.
 In that case, it was not a good time to establish her Great Dao World.
 “You don’t have to worry. Your Great Dao World is only in its infancy and can’t be considered a Great Dao World at all. Other than being absorbed by the Chaos, it won’t affect you much. If you can enter the Transcendent World, it will help you resist the power of the Endless Era.”
 The Formless Transcendent Deity continued.
 Han Huang and Han Ling continued to ask questions. The Formless Transcendent Deity patiently dispelled their concerns.
 In conclusion, it meant that the Formless Transcendent Deity was prepared to sacrifice himself to help them. He only hoped that they could help the Transcendent living beings in the future.
 In the end, the siblings said that they would consider it. Then, the illusion shattered.
 Han Jue’s consciousness returned to reality.
 He asked in his mind, “Is the Formless Transcendent Deity sincere?”
 [1 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [Sincere.]
 Han Jue finally relaxed.
 He didn’t expect the Formless Transcendent
 Deity to have such intentions.
 It seemed that the Ninth Chaos had really forced him to a dead end.
 Once the Endless Era was established, the Dao
 Creators who had been absorbed by the Great
 Dao Creators.
 The Formless Transcendent Deity was different. Transcendent was about to be
 destroyed. He wanted to contribute to all living
 beings before the Transcendent Great Dao
 World shattered.
 This Dao Creator who transcended everything and was not affected by karma also had human
 kindness.
 It was safer to ask!
 [1 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [Yes]
 Sigh, poor thing!
 Wasn’t this like survival of the fittest? The
 Ninth Chaos had succeeded, but it had sacrificed the future of the other Dao Creators.
 In that case, Han Jue wouldn’t stop him.
 He looked at Shan’e. This fellow was still
 cultivating.
 It was time for the highlight!
 Nine consecutive Creation Heaven’s Chosen!
 Han Jue flashed into the main Daoist temple.
 He rubbed his hands and stood up to stretch his muscles.
 He was a Dao Creator, so his body naturally would not go stiff. He only wanted a sense of
 ritual.
 Sincerity was the key!
 After some activity, he sat down again. [Activating the Creation Heaven’s Chosen. A random Great Creation will appear among your
 descendants.]
 [Your descendant Han Tian has awakened an
 Innate Great Creation-Ghostly Evil Star] [Your descendant Han Xinyu has awakened an Innate Great Creation-Indulgent Fantasy Star] [Your descendant Mo Zang has awakened an Innate Great Creation-Heavenly Blessed Star] [Your descendant Han Fan has awakened an Innate Great Creation-Undying Fated Star] [Your descendant Long Minggu has awakened an Innate Great Creation-Pompous Pride Star] [Your descendant Han Xuanji has awakened an Innate Great Creation-Ultimate Comprehension Star]
 [Your descendant Han Zongdao has awakened an Innate Great Creation-Heavenly Speed
 Divine Star]
 [Your descendant Han Feng has awakened an
 Innate Great Creation-Abyss Dark Star] [Your descendant Han Wuhui has awakened an Innate Great Creation-Immeasurable Absolute
 Star]
 Han Jue looked at the series of messages in front of him. They looked good.
 He began to check them one by one. The power
 of these Great Creations was very suitable for their name. Most of them were descendants of
 the Heavenly Dao’s Han family, and there were also Han family bloodlines that wandered outside like Shan’e.
 Among them, Mo Zang was also related to an
 old friend.
 Mo Zhu was Han Jue’s fellow disciple in the
 Jade Pure Sacred Sect. The two of them shared
 a relationship.
 Sage. By chance, she met Mo Zang and deduced
 his bloodline. Seeing his loneliness, she took him in as her disciple.
 Han Jue didn’t sigh much about this. Mo Zhu
 had been cultivating diligently ever since the Mo Family dissipated. At the Pseudo-Sage Realm, she obtained Han Yu’s help and successfully attained the Dao. The reason why Han Yu knew Mo Zhu was
 because of Zhou Fan. Zhou Fan had no choice
 but to escape the Heavenly Dao Sage because of Mo Fuchou’s request. Mo Zhu knew all of this. She didn’t use her
 power because of this. Instead, she kept a low
 accepted happened to encounter Han Jue’s Creation Heaven’s Chosen.
 Han Jue sent out nine clones to find the nine
 disciples who had obtained the Creation Heaven’s Chosen.
 …
 Heavenly Dao, outside the 33rd Heaven.
 In a quiet corner sat a quiet Dao Field. There were only two female stone statues in front
 of
 Dressed in a white Daoist robe, Mo Zhu sat on a
 mat made of countless petals. Her face was cold and her temperament was otherworldly. Her black hair fluttered slightly, and a breeze seemed to be circling around her.
 In the distance, in front of a stone pillar, a blue-robed youth was cultivating a Mystical Power. He looked to be fifteen or sixteen years old and had a handsome face. His skin was
 fairer than ordinary men, looking bloodless. The blue-robed youth was suddenly moved. For some reason, he suddenly felt an endless
 stream of power surge in his body, transforming his body. This feeling was too wonderful, as if he had broken through a major
 cultivation realm.
 Han Jue appeared beside the blue-robed youth and smiled. “Your Mystical Power is cultivated like a mortal practicing martial arts. You’ve let
 down your talent.”
 The blue-robed youth was shocked and hurriedly jumped away. He asked nervously, “Who are you?”
 He immediately turned to look at Mo Zhu and shouted, “Master, there’s an enemy!” Mo Zhu opened her eyes and was stunned
 when she saw Han Jue. Han Jue didn’t turn around. Instead, he stared
 at Mo Zang and smiled. “How about I teach you
 a Mystical Power?”
 Mo Zang gritted his teeth. “No. I have a master!”
 Han Jue’s expression suddenly turned cold and
 he said with killing intent, “Can you stop me if
 I want to kill your master?”
 A terrifying killing intent locked onto Mo Zang, scaring him so much that he instantly collapsed to the ground. He was covered in
 sweat as he looked at Han Jue in fear. He had never felt such killing intent!


 Mo Zang was frightened and didn’t know what to do upon facing the murderous Han Jue.
 Han Jue said coldly, “I’ll kill your master now!” His eyes narrowed. Mo Zang saw him turn around and attack Mo Zhu. The unfathomable Mo Zhu in his eyes was directly blown away. “No-” Mo Zang shouted miserably. He suddenly stood up and rushed towards Han Jue.
 Just as he stood up, he was imprisoned by an invisible force and was unable to move.
 Mo Zang looked at him with bloodshot eyes. His eyes were filled with hatred and killing intent.
 “Stop teasing him. He’s just a kid.”
 Mo Zhu’s voice suddenly floated over. Mo Zang subconsciously glanced over. Mo Zhu, who had just been reduced to ashes, had appeared again and was walking towards them.
 Looking at Han Jue again, the coldness on his face disappeared and was replaced by a refreshing smile. Coupled with his extremely handsome face, even Mo Zang was a little absent-minded.
 “What’s happening?” Mo Zang asked in a puzzled tone upon sensing that the powerful force binding him had disappeared.
 No matter how stupid he was, he could tell that Han Jue was not an enemy. He was teasing him just now.
 Mo Zhu walked to Han Jue’s side and asked, “Are you here for him?”
 Han Jue smiled and nodded.
 Mo Zhu looked at Mo Zhou and said, “Hurry up
 and kneel down to acknowledge your
 ancestor.”
 “Ancestor?”
 Mo Zang was stunned. He naturally believed his master’s words, so he knelt down and kowtowed to Han Jue.
 Han Jue looked at him and asked, “How have
 you been all these years?”
 The two of them looked at each other in silence. The past floated before their eyes.
 Han Jue no longer cared about their past, but to Mo Zhu, the memories were vivid. Along the way, she could be said to have listened to Han Jue’s legendary deeds as she cultivated. She felt regret and helplessness, and then gradually became determined.
 Han Jue didn’t object to Mo Zhu choosing her
 family back then. Everyone had their own choices. He had never wanted everyone to
 revolve around him.
 Han Jue looked at Mo Zang and asked, “Do you
 feel the power in your body?”
 Mo Zang asked in surprise, “Could this power
 be your…”
 ||
 He could tell that this ancestor in front of him
 had a close relationship with his master. Could it be because of this relationship that his
 master accepted him?
 Mo Zang had mixed emotions.
 Han Jue smiled. “It’s good that you understand. You don’t have to say it.”
 Mo Zang was silent.
 Han Jue smiled and said, “I’ll stay here and teach you for a period of time.”
 He looked at Mo Zhu.
 Mo Zhu hurriedly said, “You can stay if you
 want…”
 She became nervous. This emotion had not
 appeared for more than a hundred million years. It was so long that she almost forgot that
 she was also alone.
 Just like that, Han Jue’s clone stayed.
 The other eight clones were the same. They
 didn’t directly save the other eight descendants of the Creation Heaven’s Chosen but gave them
 a process of acceptance.
 Han Jue’s main body returned to the third Daoist temple.
 “After some time, I’ll bring back nine
 descendants who can be considered your juniors. You’ll have to take care of them.”
 Shan’e opened his eyes.
 He asked carefully, “Could it be that they were  also…”
 “Mm.”
 Han Jue nodded. Shan’e became even more
 nervous.
 it be that the progenitor was dissatisfied with his cultivation progress?
 Han Jue said, “You don’t have to think too
 much. There will be more in the future. I can’t
 only nurture you. I’ll do this every once in a
 while. You’ll also build good karma if you can teach them and take care of them.” Shan’e felt that it made sense and immediately
 agreed.
 A hundred years later.
 Han Jue’s nine clones returned with nine
 descendants. Not only them but even Mo Zhu was brought back and stayed in the third Dao
 Field.
 Upon seeing Mo Zhu, Xing Hongxuan, Fairy Xi Xuan, and Chang Yue’er were all overjoyed. Time had passed, and it was not easy to meet
 an old friend.
 Inside the Daoist temple.
 The nine descendants of the Han family meditated side by side and looked at Han Jue in
 admiration.
 This name was the supreme word of the Heavenly Dao!
 They didn’t know about the ancestor and
 Pangu until the Divine Might Heavenly Sage was the guardian of the Heavenly Dao. They didn’t expect their progenitor to have
 such a background.
 Shan’e looked at the nine new faces and
 sighed.
 He seemed to see nine unparalleled mighty
 figures about to rise. Although these guys looked young, he could sense the mysterious power in their bodies and their limitless
 potential.
 “I’ll give you great opportunities and allow you
 to be reborn. What you have to do is cultivate here well. You are not allowed to leave without my permission. You might have to spend
 cultivation levels of the nine Great Creation cultivators all soared.
 In the end, Han Jue appointed Han Zongdao, who cultivated the fastest, as the leader. He gave them the name Nine Divine Stars, and they would only serve him in the future. Han Jue began to cultivate in seclusion. Shan’e
 left the Daoist temple with the Nine Divine
 Stars and they started to get to know each other. The Nine Divine Stars all wanted to know Han Jue’s deeds. Shan’e didn’t hide anything from them and even mentioned the other mighty figures of the Han family.
 The more Shan’e talked about them, the more
 excited they became. The Nine Divine Stars also felt their blood boil. They all targeted Han Huang and also wanted to be invincible in the Chaos.
 On the other side.
 As more and more Chaotic factions joined the Transcendent Great Dao World, the Consciousnessless Great Dao World and the Shi Tian Great Dao World also began to imitate it.
 For a time, the entire Chaos swayed. All living beings were worried that the Chaos would be
 eaten.
 At this moment, an Eternal Peak appeared and wanted to unify the Chaos.
 Assembly, Zhao Shuangquan!
 Zhao Shuangquan left the Heavenly Dao and established the Nine Extremes Orthodoxy alone. He first absorbed countless geniuses and began to expand his domain. He used the excuse of resisting the three Great Dao Worlds
 to unify them, causing countless experts to seek refuge.
 The Ultimate God of Punishment did not stop
 him, causing the Great Dao Divine Spirits to secretly wonder. The leader of the Divine Spirits had said that there was no need to unite the Chaos, so Zhao Shuangquan’s actions were
 equivalent to a slap in the face. However, the Ultimate God of Punishment did
 not say anything, and the Great Dao Divine Spirits did not dare to act recklessly. Zhao Shuangquan had already grown up and was also a Divine Punisher. His status surpassed most Great Dao Divine Spirits.
 …
 Ten million years passed quickly. Han Jue reached 160 million years old and obtained a Creation Heaven’s Chosen. The Chaotic Assembly was about to begin when the Chaos became chaotic again. The geniuses
 of the other Great Dao Worlds would
 participate this time. It was known as an unprecedented Chaotic Assembly. Its foundation and difficulties far exceeded previous ones.
