 Ultimate Origin Great Creation!
 Tens of billions of years? Then he would wait!
 Han Jue didn’t lack time now, let alone he was the only Creator Lord.
 No, after reaching ten billion years old, the system would need ten billion years to trigger the choice reward…
 In that case, the time needed would be endless…
 It seemed that it would take an extremely long time to increase the Ultimate Origin Fiendcelestial’s bloodline.
 Instead of evolving his bloodline, it was better to raise it to its current limit.
 As for the Creation Heaven’s Chosen attempt, Han Jue didn’t want to use it for the time
 being. It would definitely be very exciting to use them together when he gathered a hundred!
 A hundred consecutive draws might produce a heaven-defying junior!
 Han Jue thought silently and opened the emails at the same time.
 Even more battles broke out in his circle of friends ever since he had thrown out the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority.
 He discovered that many of his good friends had gone to the Heavenly Dao, including his children.
 Did these guys think that he had thrown the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority to the Heavenly Dao?
 Impossible!
 Do you really think I care so much about the Heavenly Dao?
 Han Jue smiled. The Great Dao Providence Divine Authority was fluid and had yet to reach the Heavenly Dao. Who could obtain it depended on their luck. He was not biased.
 After reading the emails, he looked at the blank domain.
 The Dao Mystic Realm became the most famous place in the Endless Era. The event held by Formless World was very successful. It pushed out many geniuses and also spread the Great Dao Lake’s reputation.
 under the heavens was shocked.
 The Dao Mystic Realm’s status rose. Formless World could be said to be in high spirits. He had prepared for tens of millions of years, and his name had shaken the heavens.
 Faced with the Dao Mystic Realm’s success, the other factions wanted to imitate it. For a time, all sorts of low-quality Great Dao Lakes, Great Dao Springs, Great Dao Divine Mountains, and so on appeared.
 Unfortunately, they were all inferior to the
 Dao Mystic Realm’s Great Dao Lake!
 The Great Dao Lake was the work of a Dao
 Creator!
 Furthermore, this Dao Creator was the
 greatest leader of the Endless Era.
 Han Jue understood the Formless
 Transcendent Deity’s thoughts, but he didn’t
 dislike it. It was normal to accumulate strength for himself. Furthermore, Formless World’s attitude was very good, making Han
 Chu Xiaoqi and Chen Jue escaped the siege and became one of the 33 Great Dao Sages.
 As for Han Liang, he was even more impressive. He directly attained the Great Dao Supreme Realm and became the most famous
 existence in this event. His name spread
 throughout the Endless Era, and he was thought to be the most talented prodigy now!
 The Creator Lord’s grandson was not inferior to the Primordial Fiendcelestial in terms of
 physical potential!
 Han Jue was very satisfied with his two grandsons’ performance.
 They had already set off, so he didn’t need to pay too much attention to them anymore. “You can walk your own path from now on,”
 Han Jue muttered to himself. The trace of concern he had for them vanished.
 He had already sent away many children, so he naturally would not be obsessed with a
 certain grandson.
 On the other side.
 Chu Xiaoqi and Han Liang opened their eyes almost at the same time. They frowned and felt inexplicably disappointed and panicked, as if they had lost something. They couldn’t deduce what it was.
 However, no matter how they searched, they could not deduce it.
 old.
 It could also be considered adding a hint of joy to the boring cultivation years.
 Time passed.
 Han Jue’s seclusion began to lengthen after
 he severed his ties with his grandchildren. Fifty million years passed like a dream. Han Jue opened his eyes. The environment didn’t change from 50 million years ago, but he knew that the outside had already changed drastically.
 He stretched and smiled.
 It was better to enter seclusion for a longer
 time. The increase in cultivation was obvious.
 He checked his emails as he observed the blank domain.
 [Your son Han Huang established the
 Supreme Rules and his providence increased greatly.] [Your grandson Chu Xiaoqi was attacked by
 your good friend, the Divine Robe Daoist. He
 was severely injured.] [Your grand-disciple Fang Liang created a space-time world and his cultivation increased.]
 [Your good friend Huang Zuntian received a
 dream from a transcendent existence.]
 [Your son Han Tuo was attacked by your good friend Jiang Jueshi.]
 [Your good friend Dao Ancestor has recovered
 his true body and established the Supreme
 Rules.]
 [Your good friend, the Formless Transcendent encountered the dream of your enemy, the Ninth Chaos.]
 Deity,
 [Your good friend Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana
 Deity encountered the dream of your enemy, the Ninth Chaos.]
 …
 Han Huang and the Dao Ancestor established
 the Supreme Rules!
 That meant it was only a matter of time before they became Dao Creators. Han Jue was curious about where the Dao Ancestor’s Great Dao World was.
 After deducing, he learned that it was the Great Dao World where the Dao Heavenly Race was located. That Great Dao World was still
 connected to Pangu’s Great Dao World. The
 two worlds were next to each other, like a single Great Dao World. The Dao Heavenly Race called itself the Chaos, as if they were
 continuing the incense offerings of the old Chaos.
 The Dao Ancestor had actually walked in front
 of Pangu. Interesting.
 Apart from these two, the Ninth Chaos also attracted Han Jue’s attention.
 The Ninth Chaos’ will was still in the Ultimate
 Origin Heavenly Prison and had yet to
 The Ninth Chaos’ mental demon!
 This mental demon was extraordinary. The Ninth Chaos had been split into two. No wonder this fellow had said such harsh words
 before he died.
 The mental demon temporarily stayed in the Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil’s body. He disappeared for a long time. Could it be that the mental demon was still
 plotting?
 Han Jue looked at the Formless Transcendent Deity.
 He directly spied on the dream.
 Indeed, the Ninth Chaos wanted to rope in the Formless Transcendent Deity and use the gimmick of surpassing the Dao Creator Realm to incite him. Unfortunately, he was rejected.
 The Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity also rejected him.
 However, the Chaotic Consciousness and Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction Venerable were a little tempted.
 Han Jue couldn’t deduce where the Ninth
 Chaos’ mental demon was, but it mainly involved the karma on the surface of the blank domain. He could see it.
 The Ninth Chaos probably did not expect a Creator Lord to be so terrifying. Han Jue tried to visit the Ninth Chaos’ mental
 demon in his dreams but failed.
 This way, he could not use the Dark Nightmare. Where was this fellow hiding? Han Jue could only ask after the Ninth Chaos
 was successfully enslaved. During this period of time, it was impossible
 Lord!
 needed to trigger the basic rules of the blank domain. Once he entered such a state of enlightenment, as the only Creator Lord, Han Jue would definitely sense it.
 Han Jue looked at the Great Dao Providence
 Divine Authority that was thrown out.
 No one had obtained this opportunity yet. It was mainly because this opportunity was
 hidden too well. No one could expect it to help
 of the Daoist temple, preparing to go out for a
 walk.
 He did not visit his children and descendants. Instead, he came to the Fusang Divine Tree.
 its transformed
 Ever since the Fusang Tree was split into two, body had been outside all year round. As for the Divine Tree, because it was
 given the Divine Authority by Han Jue, it now had an extremely high status in the Endless
 Era and controlled space and time.


 The Fusang Divine Tree trembled upon seeing Han Jue appear. It said respectfully,
 “Greetings, Master.”
 Han Jue asked, “Can you establish a connection with the Origin Space-time?”
 !!
 Tens of millions of years ago, Han Jue had sent a voice transmission to the Fusang Divine Tree and instructed it on this mission.
 The Fusang Divine Tree supervised space-time. How could it be worthy of being the God of Space-time if it couldn’t even maintain the Origin Space-time?
 “I can’t find the Origin Space-time you mentioned, but recently, more and more cultivators have crossed space-time. Do you think we need to set up a space-time order? Perhaps I can sense the Origin Space-time more clearly after space-time stabilizes,” the Divine Tree replied with an ashamed tone. Han Jue said, “You will set the order of space-time. I will give you authority. Don’t ask me about anything. If you don’t do well, I will give the Divine Authority to another. If you don’t do it, you are also not qualified to sit in this position.”
 The Fusang Divine Tree trembled and many leaves fell, decorating the pale void into universes.
 “I’ll work hard…”
 The Fusang Divine Tree’s voice was quite weak, like a little girl.
 Han Jue left without getting his answer.
 He originally wanted to guide the Fusang Divine Tree, but he did not expect it to be so useless. Then forget it.
 He would reward it after it achieved something.
 Han Jue didn’t return to the third Dao Field. Instead, he came to the top of the blank
 domain.
 The Formless Transcendent Deity established the Transcendent Divine Hall here,
 symbolizing his noble status. Han Jue also planned to create one, but he wanted to create a world instead.
 He established a hidden domain above the Transcendent Divine Hall. No one sensed it. Even the Formless Transcendent Deity was none the wiser.
 The difference between a Creator Lord and a Dao Creator was too great. As long as Han Jue didn’t want the Formless Transcendent Deity to discover it, it would be very difficult for him to sense it even if he stood in front of
 him.
 This method naturally used the basic rules of the blank domain.
 Han Jue entered the domain he had created. It was dark red like the sky of purgatory.
 He waved his right hand and looked at the
 blue sky. Then, he paved an endless land
 below.
 The forest covered the ground. Clouds
 gathered and rain poured down. It gathered in the valley of the mountain and formed a vast sea. A familiar environment appeared. At first glance, it looked like the mortal world.
 Han Jue left a stone statue here that contained a trace of his will. If a fated person came to this world, they would obtain a huge opportunity.
 Because this world was located above the Transcendent Divine Hall, it was very difficult to discover it.
 the situation.
 Han Jue smiled in satisfaction and
 disappeared.
 Heavenly Dao, outside the 33rd Heaven, in the
 Universal Hall.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du looked at
 someone in the hall with a helpless
 expression.
 “I really don’t know the opportunity of the
 Lord. If you can’t find it, then go somewhere else,” Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said.
 The person he was speaking to was Azure Heaven Mystic.
 Azure Heaven Mystic was once a pawn
 planted in the Heavenly Dao by the Chaotic Consciousness. His potential had once stunned the Heavenly Dao, but he fell silent after the Chaotic Consciousness attacked the Chaotic Assembly. All these years, he had been cultivating in seclusion. His cultivation level had already reached the perfected Great Dao Supreme Realm. He had no choice but to
 Azure Heaven Mystic frowned and said, “In
 that case,
 let me stay in the Heavenly Dao.” Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “Of course, but don’t bully the juniors.” Azure Heaven Mystic’s personality was too arrogant. In the past, he had made countless enemies in the Heavenly Dao. He clearly rarely killed, but his mouth was foul and annoying.
 “Hmph, I understand!”
 Azure Heaven Mystic waved his hand and left.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du smiled bitterly.
 Azure Heaven Mystic looked down at the
 something. At first, he did not care, but this
 feeling lingered in his heart and would not go
 away.
 He couldn’t figure it out, so he decided to personally visit the Immortal World. There were many Great Dao Supremes hidden
 in the current Immortal World. They were all here to find the Lord’s opportunity. Therefore, they left many inheritances in the
 Immortal World and also planted a fortuitous encounter for countless future geniuses.
 …
 Dragon Court.
 This world was surrounded by an extremely
 majestic golden dragon. The power of the coiling dragon shook the blank domain, causing ordinary factions to not dare to provoke the Dragon Court.
 A stone pavilion stood quietly above the sea of
 clouds. In the pavilion was a youth in silk blue clothes. His facial features were exquisite and his long hair was tied up under a crown. had sharp eyebrows and bright eyes, like a young immortal who had walked out of a
 painting.
 He
 Han Liang opened his eyes and looked at his hands, frowning.
 “What’s missing…” Han Liang muttered to
 himself. The more he thought about it, the more frustrated he became. He grabbed his head, causing his crown to tilt. “You don’t recognize your instincts.”
 A voice sounded and a figure appeared in
 front of him.
 Han Liang frowned and slowly stood up. He asked coldly, “Who are you?”
 He had been in the Dragon Court for some
 time. He was the strongest person here. Even Long Hao was not his match. However, he sensed danger from the aura in front of him.
 The figure replied, “You can call me the Time Lord.”
 arrogant!” Han Liang said coldly. The sky outside the courtyard changed color. He used his Dharmic powers to seal the sky to prevent
 accidentally injuring the living beings of the Dragon Court.
 The Time Lord chuckled. “It’s useless. You can’t hurt me.”
 Han Liang suddenly attacked. The stone
 pavilion exploded and the sea of clouds churned.
 However, his Dharmic powers couldn’t do
 anything to the Time Lord. He was like a shadow.
 Han Liang flashed in front of the Time Lord
 and reached out to grab him. However, his hand passed through the latter. Han Liang’s pupils constricted. He immediately used a soul attack, but it was still useless.
 He couldn’t hurt the Time Lord no matter
 what method he used.
 It was as if he was hallucinating. As if the
 Time Lord did not exist.
 Han Liang stopped and asked in a low voice, “Who are you?” The Time Lord replied, “I am time, and time is me. When the world has the definition of
 time, there will be me. I am here to lead you
 on your mission.


 “What does that have to do with you?”
 Han Liang snorted coldly, his heart filled with vigilance. The other party came for him and might attack at any time.
 The Time Lord said indifferently, “I want to lead you. I can’t let you delay your talent.”
 “How arrogant. I want to see how you will lead me!”
 !!
 Killing intent burst out from Han Liang’s eyes.
 The Time Lord suddenly disappeared and his voice echoed in the air, “Han Liang, you will understand sooner or later. I am not your enemy. The two of us will reach a consensus in the future. You will understand when you see through the essence of existence.
 “I hope you’re stronger the next time we meet. At that time, I won’t persuade you like this anymore.”
 Han Liang frowned. The Dharmic powers domain in the surrounding sky dissipated and Long Hao suddenly appeared beside him.
 He asked, “What happened just now? Why did you suddenly use your Dharmic powers?”
 Han Liang did not hide anything and told him the process of meeting the Time Lord.
 Long Hao frowned.
 From this name, he knew that the other party was not easy to deal with.
 Han Liang’s strength was already very terrifying. He couldn’t hurt the other party at all.
 When did such an expert appear in the Endless Era?
 Long Hao said in a low voice, “Go ask Master.”
 “Grandpa?”
 Han Liang’s eyes lit up. That’s right, there was nothing in the world that his grandfather did not know.
 …
 Third Dao Field.
 Han Jue opened his eyes. Another ten million years had passed.
 He called Han Liang, who was waiting outside the Daoist temple, in. Although he had clones in the Dao Field, they usually did not care about this. They were only responsible for letting people in and out and guarding the Dao Field.
 Han Liang had been waiting for hundreds of thousands of years. After entering the Dao Field, he bowed respectfully.
 For some reason, he was extremely nervous when facing Han Jue.
 The wait made him realize that they were not only grandfather and grandson. There was also an insurmountable gap between the two.
 He knew how powerful his grandfather truly was after leaving this place.
 Han Jue smiled and asked, “What is it?”
 Han Liang took a deep breath and tried his best to calm down. He looked up and said, “Grandpa, do you know the Time Lord?”
 “I know.”
 “Who is he?”
 “He’s one of your Uncle-Masters, but he has already severed karma. No one remembers him, as if he had never existed,” Han Jue replied casually as if he was talking about a small matter.
 Han Liang widened his eyes. He did not expect the mysterious and terrifying Time Lord to be from the same sect. Was the Hidden Sect so terrifying?
 Ever since he was young, the Hidden Sect disciples he had encountered had always been very kind, causing him to ignore the sect’s terrifying foundation.
 Han Liang asked, “Grandpa, what should I do?”
 Han Jue said, “What do you think?”
 “I naturally can’t listen to him. Although he’s Uncle-Master, he wants to teach me how to do things. I feel that there’s a conspiracy.”
 “Then don’t listen to him.”
 “But I can’t defeat him…”
 “Then think of a way to beat him.” “I…..”
 Han Liang was speechless.
 He wanted to say that he would deal with the Time Lord, but he knew that he couldn’t say
 that.
 It was too degrading!
 He was already a Great Dao Supreme, the publicly acknowledged strongest prodigy. Did he want his grandfather to help him every time he encountered trouble?
 How would he be able to live if news of this
 spread?
 What would his grandfather think of him? Furthermore, Han Jue’s attitude might not help him. After all, the other party was his grandfather’s disciple.
 Han Liang gritted his teeth and said, “I just want to know his identity.”
 Han Jue smiled. “He’s not that terrifying. The
 reason why you can’t hurt him is that he
 doesn’t dare to appear in front of you.” Han Liang was stunned.
 Han Jue was telling the truth. Ji Xianshen
 used a method similar to a dream, but it was
 into contact with Han Liang. This would anger his origin consciousness.
 contact with their past selves, unless the other party was a Creator Lord.
 Such a situation could also be used. It was a
 fool’s dream to go to the past and kill enemies
 he could not defeat in the future. If he was
 stronger than the enemy, he did not need to go to the past.
 In the eyes of Sages and above, space and
 time were only rules that could be controlled.
 Han Liang suddenly clapped his hands and shouted, “Damn it, so he’s deliberately mystifying things!”
 He felt relieved. That the Time Lord was not
 that terrifying.
 Han Liang hurriedly thanked Han Jue.
 After chatting for a while, he left the Dao
 Field. Han Liang was worried on the way back to the Dragon Court.
 He could feel that his grandfather no longer
 doted on him as much as before. There was a distance between them now. This distance made him almost forget that they were grandfather and grandson.
 He suddenly thought of Murong Qi’s words.
 Leaving the Dao Field might really make him regret it.
 But soon, his eyes became firm again. He, Han Liang, had to rely on himself in the
 end. He couldn’t always rely on others!
 “Time Lord, very good. You can be my whetstone!”
 Han Liang regained his confidence and was in high spirits.
 In the Dao Field.
 Han Jue began to check his emails. In his
 opinion, Ji Xianshen pretending to be the Time Lord was only a small matter. Ji Xianshen, Heavenly Venerate Xun, and Fang Liang had already gathered in the Origin Space-time and reached an agreement. What they wanted was not Han Liang, but to
 surpass the Dao Creator Realm. Han Liang’s potential was their hope. Unfortunately, they couldn’t succeed. Han Jue already saw that in the future, the three of
 them would fall at the feet of Han Huang, Primordial Origin, and Huang Zuntian. Han Jue could see too many futures. It was impossible for him to be wary of all futures. In that case, it was better to kill all living beings so that he would be left alone. However, in that case, the basic rules of the blank domain would backfire.
 Primordial Chaos, Chaos, and the Heavenly Dao. Previously, they seemed to be isolated by the blank domain, but they were actually protected. How could they stop the basic rules if they really wanted to destroy them? Putting down the matter of Ji Xianshen, Han Jue focused on reading the emails. Han Huang and the Dao Ancestor had not
 moved recently.
 It seemed they immersed themselves in the
 construction of the Great Dao World after establishing the Supreme Rules.
 Han Jue looked at them.
 Han Huang’s Primordial Chaos developed the
 fastest among the three Primordial Chaos. Its scale had already surpassed the Heavenly Dao. All sorts of rules and Great Dao were gradually being perfected, attracting an endless stream of races to join it. The Dao Ancestor encountered trouble. Back then, he had established the Dao Heavenly Race to obtain opportunities in the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity. However, now, the Dao Heavenly Race dominated his and
 Pangu’s Great Dao World. Any foreign races that joined were enslaved by the Dao Heavenly Race, causing their reputation to begin to worsen.
 How could the Great Dao World be established just by relying on one race?
 The Dao Ancestor began to think of a way to suppress the Dao Heavenly Race, but he
 couldn’t personally take action. Therefore, various Heavenly Tribulations and fates of the Dao Heavenly Race began to appear. This powerful race that wanted to dominate
 the world had no choice but to drop its
 delusions.
 Han Jue began to look forward to it. Between Han Huang and the Dao Ancestor, who could







 “Then what do you think we should target, Master? Do you want us to fight for power?”
 Chu Xiaoqi chuckled. He felt that his current life was quite good. He had nothing to cultivate and could go out with Chen Jue when he was bored.
 Huang Zuntian snorted. “I’m confused. At your cultivation level, cultivation alone is not enough. You definitely have to create your own world. Whether the world can take form depends on whether the power you nurture is strong enough. With more living beings, there will naturally be more friction. Conflict is inevitable.”
 Chu Xiaoqi was silent. He felt that it made sense, but he also felt that something was wrong.
 !!
 Chen Jue asked, “Senior, other than creating a world, is there really no other way?”
 Huang Zuntian glanced at him and said, “Perhaps, but not at the moment. Your
 Chen Jue frowned.
 With that, he vanished.
 Chu Xiaoqi and Chen Jue looked at each other and saw the confusion in each other’s eyes.
 Huang Zuntian came to talk about this?
 Chen Jue sat down again and suddenly said, “Perhaps it’s time for us to part ways.
 ||
 Chu Xiaoqi’s eyes widened. “If you want to create a force, we can join forces!”
 “We’ve worked together for long enough. It’s time to split up. Xiaoqi, everyone has to have their own goals. The so-called carefreeness is too much.”
 Chen Jue shook his head and looked into the distance. He became extremely determined. He seemed to have made a decision.
 Chu Xiaoqi wanted to say something but hesitated. Looking at Chen Jue’s side profile, his words were stuck in his throat and he
 could not say anything.
 Indeed, if they did not separate now, when would they?
 Even for couples, how many people could hold hands for tens of millions of years?
 …
 Time passed. The heavens couldn’t affect Han
 Jue no matter how they fought.
 He stayed in the Dao Field and cultivated
 quietly. Time passed quickly.
 In the past few years, the order of space-time had stabilized. Transmigrators were almost extinct. The Fusang Tree was also afraid of disappointing Han Jue. This also caused space-time to stabilize. The Fusang Tree’s cultivation level also increased. She was overjoyed and treated space-time more seriously.
 In the blink of an eye, thirty million years
 passed.
 Han Jue walked out of the Daoist temple and stretched facing the sun.
 In the past few years, his cultivation level had increased faster than before. He sensed carefully and benefited from the development of the Ultimate Origin World.
 Han Ling wanted to obtain the bloodline of
 various major factions, other geniuses of low birth began to appear. The Ultimate Origin World was no longer as calm as before. Instead, it was surging.
 Chaos was not a good thing for the major factions of the Ultimate Origin World, but sometimes, it was beneficial to all living beings, especially living beings with low backgrounds. Chaos was also an opportunity for them. Of course, regardless of whether they were in chaos, it was survival of the
 fittest.
 Han Jue disappeared and came to the Ultimate Origin World.
 This was the edge of the Ultimate Origin
 World. Blood Qi filled the void. The broken meteors formed rings. In the center of the rings floated a huge stone tablet. The stone tablet was carved with blood words. The blood Qi in this area was emitted from these blood
 words.
 A figure sat on the stone tablet. It was a white-haired man. He was slightly thin and handsome, but because he was only skin and
 bones, he looked very weak.
 “How long can you last by squeezing out your potential like this?”
 A chuckle sounded.
 The white-haired man couldn’t help but open
 his eyes. An extremely handsome man appeared in
 front of him. He subconsciously frowned. Han Jue stared at the white-haired man with
 a faint smile.
 This white-haired man was the evil devil that
 Han Ling coveted. He was the strongest talent born in the Ultimate Origin World and was even stronger than the Great Dao Fiendcelestials.
 The white-haired man frowned and asked,
 “Who are you?”
 He didn’t attack because Han Jue made him
 feel a sense of familiarity.
 Han Jue sat in front of him and smiled. “It
 doesn’t matter who I am. The point is that you’re in trouble. If this stalemate continues, you’ll reach the end sooner or later.” The white-haired man suddenly thought of
 something and asked with an excited
 expression, “You are… Grandpa Deity?” He was very excited.
 Han Jue smiled and didn’t deny it.
 The white-haired man’s potential was number one in the Ultimate Origin World and
 he was blessed by the heavens. How could Han Jue not know? However, he didn’t specially take care of him. He imitated the
 Heavenly Dao’s Chaotic Domain. Anyone with outstanding potential could enter the Chaotic
 Domain. This was how he knew of Dao Sovereign and Zhao Xuanyuan. The threshold of the Ultimate Origin World’s
 genius domain was extremely high. Currently, only the white-haired man could step into it. This person’s name was Dugu Wu. He was
 already an orphan when he was aware of himself. Fortunately, he had awakened his bloodline and stepped into the domain of
 geniuses. There, a wisp of Han Jue’s will taught him cultivation. Only then could he make a name for himself.
 If not for Han Jue, no matter how talented
 Dugu Wu was, how could he have relied on himself to cultivate until today?
 It was precisely because of the opportunities
 in the prodigy domain that Dugu Wu disdained the other factions.
 Dugu Wu kowtowed excitedly. Han Jue smiled and asked, “You know it’s me
 just by looking at my figure?” “Your aura is so unfathomable. No one can give me such a feeling in the entire Ultimate
 Origin World. Grandpa Deity, can I call you Master?” Dugu Wu asked carefully. He was already a Great Dao Supreme. Not many people could resist him in the entire Ultimate
 Origin World. However, facing Han Jue, he couldn’t resist at all.
 It was definitely the person in his memories!
 Han Jue smiled and said, “It’s been a long time since I took in a disciple.” “Master, please accept me as your disciple!”
 “Do you know my identity?”
 “I don’t know.”
 “The Emperor who wants to snatch your
 bloodline is my daughter. I created the Great Dao Fiendcelestials and the Nether Race who bullied you.”
 “What?”
 Dugu Wu was shocked and in disbelief.
 Han Jue stared at him with a smile. His
 [Dugu Wu has a favorable impression of you. Current favorability: 6 stars]
 Dugu Wu looked at him and said, “Master, you definitely won’t harm me. To be able to create the Great Dao Fiendcelestials and the Nether Race, you should be the master of the Ultimate Origin World, a supreme existence. After thinking about it, if you also like my potential and your daughter has a way to snatch it, how can you not? The reason why you didn’t stop her is also a form of training
 for me, right?”
 for so long, you should be able to sense your problem. Actually, you didn’t have to do this.” At first, the Great Dao Fiendcelestials had recruited Dugu Wu, but he was disdainful and spoke arrogantly, infuriating the other party. Therefore, they spread rumors, causing all the Great Dao Fiendcelestials to take their anger out on him. He couldn’t be bothered to explain as he yearned to fight.
 As time passed, Dugu Wu became the entire
 Ultimate Origin World’s enemy. Dugu Wu was silent. He let down his guard in front of Han Jue and sighed.
