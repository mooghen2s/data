 Breakthrough! Supreme
 Existence!
 Han Jue wasn’t confused by his Dao heart’s question.
 From the beginning to the end, he was very determined.
 “I won’t especially do anything. Instead, I’ll do whatever I want. Since I’m invincible, why set up rules for myself?” Han Jue replied. The other him nodded in satisfaction.
 A true invincible person should be unrestrained. There were no rules, strength, morals, or other restrictions.
 The other asked, “Will you continue cultivating?”
 “Yes, I will constantly climb higher and higher. I won’t consolidate my status by suppressing the juniors.”
 Han Jue smiled confidently. He would be numb sooner or later as long as he lost his ambition.
 During the Primordial Era, had anyone ever thought that several Dao Creators would appear?
 The other him, which was formed by his Dao heart, dissipated like smoke, leaving only a
 sentence.
 “The Creator Lord Realm is ahead. I wish you success.”
 In the blank domain.
 Various gaseous substances of different colors moved faster.
 Han Jue could suddenly spy on the Chaos. Time passed extremely quickly in the Chaos! A second here was a million years outside!
 Han Jue saw Han Huang attack and shock the Chaos, bringing despair to it. Then, he sent out Primordial Despair and slaughtered wantonly. Seeing that the Chaos was about to be defeated, the Ninth Chaos made a move. Other than Zhao Shuangquan and Yu Yuan, six more Chaos revived. In addition to his clone, the nine Chaos attacked together to suppress the Primordial Chaos.
 At the critical moment, Primordial Origin attacked to reinforce Han Huang. The two Primordial Fiendcelestials joined forces to resist the nine Chaos.
 The Ninth Chaos couldn’t withstand the
 pressure and began to personally interfere with the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity.
 Han Jue frowned.
 Could this be one of the tests?
 Han Jue’s eyes became firm.
 No one could interfere and burden him!
 The Ninth Chaos could revive all living beings
 in the Chaos. Why couldn’t he revive his children and disciples if he became a Creator Lord?
 Han Huang would definitely die in this Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity without his help. Not only Han Huang, but also the personal disciples who supported him.
 and disciples.
 His mind had been firm and selfish ever since
 he was weak.
 He would only help those close to him if he could. If he could not, he would only care
 about himself.
 Han Jue had a clear conscience as he looked at
 everyone around him. He didn’t owe anyone
 anything!
 Including his wife and children.
 If not for him, how could they reach this
 level!
 Lord!”
 Han Jue’s eyes became arrogant and
 confident.
 As this arrogance rose, the Qi-shaped substances along the way surged towards
 him, forging his body. His body dissipated, leaving only his soul to advance.
 All sorts of lights overflowed from his soul,
 dazzling. He could clearly feel his soul transforming.
 He felt a power that was higher than the Supreme Rules of the Great Dao World. This feeling was extremely strange.
 After walking for an unknown period of time,
 Han Jue’s soul strength reached the extreme. This was unprecedentedly powerful, making him excited.
 His soul stopped when it couldn’t take it
 anymore.
 There were still densely packed Qi-shaped substances ahead. They were still so dazzling, as if he had never stepped forward.
 Han Jue raised his right palm and muttered, “The Creator Lord controls everything. Nothing can stop him. In that case, I’ll see if
 my strength is enough.”
 Boom-
 He struck out with his palm. It was the Divine
 The extreme destructive power directly shattered everything in front of him. This blank domain shattered like a mirror. Absolute paleness entered his vision again.
 He shattered the rules of the blank domain
 with a palm!
 At this moment, Han Jue had already surpassed the Creator Lord.
 His body condensed again and began to fuse
 with his soul. The Ultimate Origin Power began to transform.
 A pillar of light shot out from his body. There
 was no end to it above or below, as if it was
 splitting the blank domain into two!
 His aura soared with unstoppable force! Han Jue was immersed.
 A figure appeared near him at this moment.
 It was the Ninth Chaos. “You… how is that possible…” the Ninth Chaos shouted in shock.
 Han Jue felt that he was too noisy. With a
 glance, he destroyed the Ninth Chaos’ body and soul. Even the remaining Transcendent Rule Insignia in every corner of the blank domain
 perished.
 In other words, the Ninth Chaos had directly
 perished! Just a glance!
 He couldn’t resist at all!
 This glance used the power of the rules of the
 blank domain, so the Ninth Chaos Transcendent Rule hidden in every corner of the blank domain had nowhere to hide and
 thus died.
 The difference between a Dao Creator and a Creator Lord was immediately revealed.
 Han Jue was calm and continued to enjoy the breakthrough.
 Not long after, the Formless Transcendent Deity and the Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity appeared.
 They looked at Han Jue in shock.
 He didn’t attack these two subordinates. The Formless Transcendent Deity said helplessly, “Why didn’t you appear earlier… Back then, the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity…’
 ||
 Han Jue already knew that even though he
 seemed to have broken through very quickly,
 a long time had actually passed. The Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity had already ended for a long time, so long that all
 living beings in the Endless Era had already forgotten the Chaos.
 Apart from his wives and children who stayed
 in Han Jue’s Dao Field, Han Huang, Ji Xianshen, Murong Qi, and the others had all died in the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity. Han Ling, Han Ye, Han Yao, and Han Bashen
 survived because they supported the Chaos. All of this was very similar to the future that
 Han Jue had deduced.
 Han Jue indifferently said, “There’s still time. You can leave.”
 The Formless Transcendent Deity and the
 Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity looked at each other in confusion.
 Could it be that Han Jue wanted to reverse space-time?
 However, this was the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity. It was independent
 of space and time. The supreme karma could
 not be reversed.
 Although they were puzzled, they had no choice but to leave.
 Han Jue grew quiet again and began to consolidate his cultivation in peace.
 This time, it took much longer to consolidate
 his cultivation.
 Another person arrived after an unknown period of time.
 It was Han Ling.
 She emitted endless divine light. She was even
 more holy than the former Holy Mother of Order.
 She looked at Han Jue and said respectfully, “Father, you’re indeed still here.”
 The pillar of light on Han Jue’s body was extremely dazzling. That terrifying power made Han Ling instinctively afraid. She was shocked.
 How strong was her father?
 Han Jue glanced at her and said, “It’s been
 hard on you all these years.”
 “Father…’
 ||
 All sorts of emotions surged into Han Ling’s
 heart, making her feel a long-awaited
 grievance.
 She wanted to say something else, but she left
 silently upon seeing that Han Jue was busy breaking through.
 Too many things had happened, pulling her away from her father.
 Han Jue understood her but didn’t say
 anything.
 He could turn everything into an illusion and reconstruct the past when he successfully
 broke through.


 After a long time.
 [You have obtained the Dominator Supreme Treasure-Dominator Brush]
 [Dominator Brush: Dominator Supreme Treasure, a transcendent Supreme Treasure higher than an Ultimate Supreme Treasure. It is condensed from the Origin Rule and contains the supreme power to define and dominate everything. It is only subordinate to the Creator Lord.]
 [The Dao Field has begun to upgrade.] Notifications appeared in front of Han Jue.
 Dominator Brush?
 Not bad, it suited his style!
 Han Jue checked his attributes panel.

 His lifespan stopped when he was
 expected of the Creator Lord Realm. His origin
 lifespan stopped flowing when he broke
 through. In fact, countless years had passed in the Chaos. Even the Endless Era had stabilized. It could be seen that this creation was truly magical.
 Han Jue sensed his cultivation and asked in his mind, “Is the system’s calculation of
 lifespan independent?”
 [That’s right. It only calculates origin lifespan
 and not relative lifespan.]
 Han Jue had no intention of asking anymore.
 With a thought, he returned to the Daoist
 temple of the third Dao Field.
 The auras of the Dao Companions were still
 there, other than Li Yao.
 Han Jue sat on the lotus throne and looked
 down at the Endless Era.
 The Endless Era was indeed exciting. A new
 Dao Creator appeared after the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity ended. It was Zhao Shuangquan. This was normal. After all, the Ninth Chaos had personally participated in the battle.
 However, all of this was meaningless in front of the Creator Lord.
 Han Jue muttered, “Ninth Chaos, I still want to fight you for real. In that case, let’s return
 to square one.”
 With that, everything in the Endless Era stopped.
 The operating planets stopped. The endless
 River of Destiny no longer surged. The bright sun no longer burned. Yin and Yang no longer spun. The figures traveling through the various space-time voids all stopped. Be it the past, the present, or the future, as Han Jue had this thought, everything stopped. Immediately after, all the scenes began to
 replay.
 Han Jue directly returned everything to before his will traveled in the blank domain. The Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity was still ongoing. The Ninth Chaos was still alive. His children and disciples were still alive.
 This was a true change, not the creation of an alternate space-time. Everything that had happened before did not exist. No one even knew that Han Jue had broken through. The Ninth Chaos didn’t know, either.
 The corners of his mouth curled up as he
 smiled playfully. “Chaos, how are you going
 to fight me?”
 What could a Dao Creator do to a Creator
 Lord?
 However, Han Jue was interested in playing with the Ninth Chaos.
 At this moment, the Chaos was still in a
 chaotic battle. Han Huang had yet to make a move. Thinking about it carefully, the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity had just begun. Han Jue didn’t plan to end everything directly. He had enough confidence to act recklessly now.
 From this life onwards, Han Jue was never
 passive when fighting the enemy. Every time
 he attacked, he definitely had the confidence to kill the other party.
 Han Jue might have been able to defeat the
 eyes. Han Jue took out the Dominator Brush.
 This was a brush printed with seven-colored
 Dao runes. The brush head was connected to the power of the three thousand Great Dao. The body of the brush was condensed from the basic rules of the blank domain. This brush could create and destroy everything. A non-Creator Lord would be reduced to ashes upon touching this brush.
 A Dao Creator might be able to revive, but a
 Great Dao Supreme wouldn’t even have a chance to revive!
 In other words, he could crush a Great Dao
 Supreme if he threw the Dominator Brush directly into the Chaos.
 Han Jue played with the Dominator Brush and felt its power.
 …
 Transcendent Domain.
 In a mysterious space.
 The Formless woke
 up.
 Transcendent Deity suddenly
 “What’s going on? What did it feel like just now? The Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity?” the Formless Transcendent Deity muttered to himself. He felt inexplicably uneasy, but he couldn’t deduce his feelings
 just now.
 Perhaps because the situation of the Chaos made him anxious, the Chaotic Consciousness and Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction Venerable chose to support the Ninth Chaos. The clones created by the two sides couldn’t
 It was unknown what he was thinking. When would he make a move?
 At this moment, he suddenly felt a powerful
 aura.
 “Han Huang… This power is already infinitely close to the Dao Creator Realm. Unfortunately, its essence has not changed.” The Formless Transcendent Deity sighed. As a Dao Creator, he could see very clearly that Han Huang had taken the wrong path. He was
 …
 In the third Dao Field, the Nine Divine Stars returned.
 Han Jue’s clone placed them in the Dao Field. They immediately came to his Daoist temple and knelt down, waiting for him to summon
 them.
 The door opened and the Nine Divine Stars entered the temple.
 They knelt down respectfully.
 Han Zongdao waved his hand and released the
 was in an extremely sorry state. He opened
 his eyes and was stunned when he saw Han
 Jue.
 Han Jue’s appearance stunned him. In a daze,
 he seemed to see Han Ling.
 Whoosh-
 The Ultimate Origin Fiendcelestial’s soul
 The Nine Divine Stars were stunned.
 Han Jue, who was checking his emails, raised
 his eyebrows. The Ultimate Origin Fiendcelestial’s soul condensed again. He had to restrain the power of the Creator
 Lord’s divinity.
 No living being could profane the Creator
 Lord, much less stare at him for long.
 The Nine Divine Stars had long developed manners. They only glanced at Han Jue before
 lowering their heads, so they didn’t feel anything.
 The revived Ultimate Origin Fiendcelestial
 was still in shock and didn’t dare to look at him anymore. “What’s going on… Who is he… Did I die just
 now?” The Ultimate Origin Fiendcelestial recalled the terrifying feeling just now. He had never
 felt such terrifying suffocation. Despair filled his heart and could not go away.
 Han Jue didn’t disperse the Nine Divine Stars. Instead, he looked down at the Ultimate Origin Fiendcelestial and said, “The Ultimate Origin Fiendcelestial is me. You’re only formed by a trace of Ultimate Origin Qi left
 behind when I created the Ultimate Origin World, but you want to steal my name. What punishment do you deserve for this crime?” The Ultimate Origin Fiendcelestial shivered,
 not knowing how to answer.
 His name was his pride. If it was anyone else,
 he would definitely be furious and risk his life
 to protect his dignity. However, he only had endless fear and no courage in front of Han
 Jue.


 Ultimate Origin Fiendcelestial?
 So there really was an Ultimate Origin Fiendcelestial!
 Just as the Ultimate Origin Fiendcelestial was about to be frightened to death, Han Jue changed the topic and said, “On account of our relationship, from now on your name will be Han Zhongyuan and you will join the Nine Divine Stars to serve me. How about that?”
 The pressure that terrified the Ultimate Origin Fiendcelestial immediately vanished.
 The Ultimate Origin Fiendcelestial felt relieved and hurriedly said, “I’m willing! I’m willing!
 At this point, the Ultimate Origin Fiendcelestial changed its name to Han Zhongyuan and the Nine Divine Stars became the Ten Divine Stars.
 Han Jue took out nine Chaotic Supreme Treasures and rewarded them to the Nine Divine Stars. These Dharma treasures were originally ordinary Dharma treasures. They were modified by him with the power of a dominator and instantly became Chaotic Supreme Treasures.
 The Nine Divine Stars were pleasantly surprised. They hurriedly thanked him and left with Han Zhongyuan.
 As for Han Zhongyuan, there was no need for Han Jue to reward him. Letting him join the Divine Stars was already a huge opportunity.
 Han Jue continued to read the emails.
 Shan’e came to visit not long after.
 He looked at Han Jue and felt a little
 embarrassed.
 Han Jue understood his thoughts and took out the Book of Misfortune.
 Shan’e was shocked when he saw this book.
 Could it be…
 He did not dare to ask.
 Han Jue didn’t explain. Other than being
 interesting, the identity of the Dark
 Forbidden Lord was meaningless to him now. Furthermore, Shan’e didn’t dare to say it.
 Shan’e obtained the Supreme Treasure and
 left happily.
 Han Jue came to Xing Hongxuan’s Daoist
 temple after reading the emails.
 There were only two people in the temple.
 Xing Hongxuan was naturally happy and immediately came over.
 “I’m already invincible.”
 Han Jue’s first sentence stunned Xing
 Hongxuan.
 He was invincible so quickly?
 Even Xing Hongxuan, who was confident in
 Han Jue, was shocked.
 Han Jue threw the space-time he had erased into Xing Hongxuan’s mind.
 She saw the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity without Han Jue’s help. She saw the Ninth Chaos and the Formless Transcendent Deity. She saw the Ninth Chaos being glared to death by Han Jue and saw Han Ling’s grievance and stubbornness.
 long time when she recalled all her memories. It was as if she had lived another life. She felt like it was a dream when she suddenly looked
 back.
 A future without her husband was really
 terrifying.
 Xing Hongxuan suddenly woke up and patted her chest. She said fearfully, “Fortunately, I didn’t listen to the other sisters. Otherwise, I would have died too. Damn it, who is that mysterious transcendent existence?”
 Han Jue smiled. “The Ninth Chaos, the existence who created the Chaos. Remember, don’t say his name, or he will notice.”
 Xing Hongxuan asked, “Aren’t you already invincible? Why are you still caring about
 him?”
 “I want to fight him. Before that, don’t disturb him.”
 “What’s the chance of winning?” “As you can see, he dies if I want him to.”
 No.
 Perhaps this was him.
 Previously, it was only because he was not
 strong enough that he suppressed his nature.
 Xing Hongxuan recalled Han Jue’s attitude when facing a powerful enemy and
 overlapped it with his current self.
 She thought of her first encounter with Han
 Jue when she was young.
 At that time, she took interest in him because
 of his handsomeness. She didn’t expect to obtain such a huge opportunity.
 Looking back, Xing Hongxuan was suddenly filled with pride. She had good judgment. Unlike other women, she was the first to like
 Han Jue and pestered him. No matter what, she didn’t leave Han Jue. She had always believed in him firmly and helped him. This
 was also the reason why he treated her the
 best.
 Xing Hongxuan and Han Jue could see through the essence of some things, but they
 Hongxuan.
 Xing Hongxuan suddenly asked excitedly, “Do
 I not have to cultivate anymore?” Han Jue raised his hand and took out the
 Dominator Brush. He waved it at her, and a mark entered her body.
 “From today onwards, anyone below the Dao
 Creator Realm will die as you wish. Therefore,
 control your thoughts. As for the Dao Creators, they can’t kill you.’
 Han Jue spoke calmly, but Xing Hongxuan was inexplicably nervous.
 The human heart was extremely sinister. Xing Hongxuan also had her own dark side. She was afraid that a thought from her would
 destroy the Chaos. She had to be careful in the future.
 Xing Hongxuan asked curiously, “What realm
 are you at now? Did you surpass the Dao Creator Realm?”
 Han Jue smiled. “Don’t ask. Leave some
 Xing Hongxuan hurriedly promised, “I won’t
 tell anyone!”
 She smiled proudly and rolled up her sleeves. “Husband, I want to go out for a walk and test how invincible I am.”
 Han Jue rubbed her head and smiled. “Go.”
 “No, there’s no hurry. Let me experience the
 invincible power first.”
 “How?”
 “Hmph, Husband only knows how to pretend.
 You definitely understand what I mean.” “Then I’ll let you experience it.
 Several hundred years later. Xing Hongxuan left the third Dao Field, and
 Han Jue began to preach the Dao to the disciples of the third Dao Field. He deliberately controlled himself, but the disciples were still reborn.
 After the lecture, Han Jue visited the other Dao Companions one by one. Fairy Xi Xuan asked curiously, “Why did Xing
 Hongxuan go out alone? What’s the matter?”
 Han Jue smiled. “She wants to mess around.” “Nonsense?”
 “You’ll know later.”
 Han Jue left after interacting with Fairy Xi Xuan for a few decades. He decided to take a walk. From now on, cultivating for hundreds of
 millions of years would not affect him much. His cultivation in the future would definitely be extremely long.
 Han Jue hid his identity. Even the Dao Creators couldn’t deduce it.
 He prepared to release his malice and experience a different life from mortals. He prepared to magnify his various emotions one by one. It happened to be the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity. It was fine to let it be more chaotic.
 Han Jue first came to Shi Tian’s domain and
 landed in a world. The divine light on his body
 retracted and transformed into an ordinary face.
 He walked around aimlessly and killed anyone he disliked.
 In just ten thousand years, Han Jue gained a terrifying reputation. From mortals to the Great Dao Supremes, he killed anyone he
 didn’t like and was called the Killing God Shi Tian.
 No one knew why Killing God Shi Tian killed for no reason. It was as if he was born bloodthirsty.
 As he killed, Han Jue’s hatred increased. The
 various factions in the Shi Tian Domain, who were originally supporting the Chaos, had no choice but to return and besiege him.
 Shi Tian’s clone also descended and blocked
 his
 path.
 “Who sent you?”
 The Immeasurable Destruction Venerable was
 majestic and domineering. Space shook the moment he appeared.
 Han Jue ignored him and continued forward. The Immeasurable Destruction Venerable was furious. He suddenly flashed in front of Han
 Jue and struck out with his palm. Han Jue’s eyes narrowed. Immeasurable Destruction Venerable’s body and soul were directly destroyed.
 The Great Dao Supremes and Great Dao Sages
 who rushed over from all directions
 immediately stopped in fear and looked at
 him in disbelief.


 Han Jue, who had released the malice in his heart, felt annoyed upon seeing the figures standing at the end of the void in all directions. He waved his right hand, and the bodies and souls of those figures were all destroyed.
 They didn’t even have time to scream!
 These ancient giants who controlled the world in Shi Tian’s domain were helpless in front of Han Jue.
 It was boring.
 Han Jue was neither happy nor sad as he continued forward.
 He prepared to travel the various Great Dao Worlds and kill. His ferocious reputation became stronger and stronger.
 [Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction Venerable sent you a dream. Do you accept?]
 Han Jue ignored the notification and continued forward.
 Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction Venerable was furious. He wanted to ignore his reputation and forcefully move Han Jue out. However, he failed.
 “Impossible…”
 Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction Venerable was moved and instantly guessed
 the other party’s identity.
 Dao Creator!
 However, the other party’s aura was
 unfamiliar to him. He couldn’t see through it and could not deduce its origin at all.
 This was different from the feeling brought by the Ninth Chaos, the Divine Might Heavenly Sage, the Chaotic Consciousness, the Formless Transcendent Deity, and the Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity.
 Furthermore, doing this…
 Dark Forbidden Lord?!
 Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction Venerable was shocked by his guess. If it was really the Dark Forbidden Lord, he was not someone he could deal with.
 He immediately went to find the Ninth Chaos.
 A huge tree stood on a floating land in the depths of the blank domain. There were many branches and every leaf had a space-time dimension that seemed to be covered in water droplets.
 The Ninth Chaos meditated quietly under the tree. Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction
 Venerable had just left.
 The Ninth Chaos dispersed the mist and
 revealed his true body. His figure was human, but his face was extremely strange. His skin was pale and bloodless. He had no facial features. The slightly raised part of his face looked like his mouth and nose. His
 waterfall-like long hair scattered behind his black robe.
 A shadow appeared. It looked extremely similar to the Ninth Chaos. He stared at it and
 more chaotic. Another Dao Creator has appeared. The situation is not good.” This shadow was the First Chaos’ will.
 The Ninth Chaos sighed. “My cultivation level can’t increase. I need an opportunity if I want to break through. Logically speaking, I can directly break through to a higher realm after reaching the perfected minor realm, but I failed. If the Endless Era still doesn’t work, there might not be a higher realm at all.”
 The First Chaos was silent.
 After a long while…
 The First Chaos asked again, “How can you clean up the mess if there’s no higher realm?
 Dao Creators can’t kill each other.”
 “Then, we can only use the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity to suppress them. If even I can’t break through, it’s impossible for Divine Might to break through. He’s too
 young. The other Dao Creators have already reached the end. What makes me feel threatened are the Dark Forbidden Lord and Divine Might’s Dao Field. The Dark Forbidden Lord only dares to curse, which means that
 he’s not strong enough. Divine Might’s Dao Field can isolate my prying. Furthermore, I can’t barge in. There’s actually such an existence. I can’t figure it out.”
 The Ninth Chaos had witnessed Han Jue transmigrating from the Eighth Chaos to the reincarnation of the current Chaos and could confirm that he had no deeper background.
 Therefore, he thought that the Dao Field was
 a Supreme Treasure and not a manifestation of Han Jue’s strength.
 It was as if a Sage felt that it was impossible
 for a mortal without an illustrious previous life to attain the Dao at birth.
 The First Chaos didn’t say anything else. He could only believe the Ninth Chaos.
 If even the Ninth Chaos could not see through it, he naturally could not resolve the problem.
 Primordial Chaos.
 Xing Hongxuan rode a cloud and landed in
 front of a hall.
 Three words were carved on the plaque of the palace-
 Ming Ji Palace.
 finished speaking, figures appeared and surrounded her.
 These were all Goddess Ming Ji’s personal guards. The Primordial cultivators who belonged to Han Huang did not dare to stop
 her, so they let her in.
 “Wait.”
 Goddess Ming Ji’s voice floated over and
 stopped the personal guards who were about
 to attack.
 The door to Ming Ji Palace opened and the dignified Goddess Ming Ji walked over. The personal guards made way for the two
 women.
 Goddess Ming Ji said expressionlessly, “I
 should call you Mother. Now that I’m married to my husband, we’re naturally family. Mother, are you still calculative about the
 past?”
 kill me? Don’t you feel awkward calling me Mother now?”!
 “Then what do you want?”
 “I want to kill you too.” “Hehe, do you have the ability? Let’s go. I
 won’t pursue this matter on account of my husband.”
 “The marriage has to be approved by the
 parents. Have we agreed to this marriage?” “You… Can you control my husband?” “I can’t control him, but I can control you.”
 quickly turned white. Her skin shriveled and her vitality flowed out extremely quickly.
 “You…”
 Goddess Ming Ji’s eyes widened and she tried
 to mobilize her Dharmic powers. She wanted
 to stop the abnormality in her body, but she failed. The surrounding personal guards were also shocked. Goddess Ming Ji was a Great Dao Sage. How could she be so easily affected? They didn’t even see how the other party did
 it.
 Xing Hongxuan smiled proudly. “Will Huang’er still like you if I make you lose your ten million years of beauty?” With that, she turned around and left.
 “Catch her!” Goddess Ming Ji shouted crazily. The personal guards used their Mystical Powers one after another. They didn’t dare to
 approach and wanted to suppress Xing Hongxuan remotely.
 However, they were suddenly reduced to
 ashes just as they made their move, their bodies and souls destroyed. Xing Hongxuan didn’t say anything and left.
 Goddess Ming Ji was stunned when she saw this.
 Xing Hongxuan was not so terrifying the last time she fought the Heavenly Dao. She even felt that Xing Hongxuan was even more terrifying than her husband. She was unfathomable and unstoppable. Why was this happening?
 In Shi Tian’s domain.
 Han Jue was suddenly tired of it as he swept
 around and killed countless unpleasant living beings.
 He retracted his malice and began to magnify
 his kindness.
 Thereafter, he wandered around Shi Tian’s
 domain again. He would help whenever he encountered unfair and unjust things. From the Great Dao Supremes to the mortals, he no
 longer killed. Even when facing the perpetrator, he only warned and taught them a lesson.
 Year after year passed. Millions of years passed quickly. Han Jue’s actions in Shi Tian spread to all
 living beings. He was called a Virtuous Sage.
 it
 living beings in Shi Tian. Statues of him were erected in all worlds.
 Han Jue came to the palace where Shi Tian’s
 clone was. Shi Tian’s clone had nearly 800 trillion years of strength. Previously, the Immeasurable Destruction Venerable had been destroyed by Han Jue. In order to maintain the situation, Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction Venerable had no choice but to create a new
 one.
 This clone was still named Immeasurable Destruction Venerable. “Now, tell me, should I kill or help Shi Tian?”
 Han Jue’s voice floated into the ears of the Immeasurable Destruction Venerable, startling him so much that he opened his
 eyes.
 He immediately stood up in fear upon seeing him.


 “Dark Forbidden Lord?” Immeasurable Destruction Venerable asked in a low voice, pretending to be calm. Even his main body panicked when facing the Dark Forbidden Lord. This was an existence that had cursed the Ninth Chaos to develop mental demons. How could he not panic?
 Han Jue asked, “Answer my question.”
 Immeasurable Destruction Venerable was silent. He didn’t understand what he meant. Was he humiliating him?
 Han Jue stared at him with a calm gaze.
 The calmer it was, the less confident Immeasurable Destruction Venerable became.
 The difference in strength between them was too great. Immeasurable Destruction Venerable didn’t even have a chance to escape.
 Immeasurable Destruction Venerable gritted his teeth and said, “You saved Shi Tian’s living beings. They should be grateful to you. Although you have sinned, your contributions outweigh your mistakes.”
 Han Jue smiled and asked, “Sincere?”
 “That’s right…” Immeasurable Destruction Venerable said helplessly. He had no choice but to bow his head.
 Even Dao Creators didn’t dare to act recklessly in the face of existences stronger than them.
 Perhaps the Dao Creator would not die, but Han Jue could threaten his Great Dao World.
 Han Jue shook his head and laughed before disappearing.
 Immeasurable Destruction Venerable was even more nervous. He looked at Shi Tian, afraid that Han Jue would destroy him.
 However, Shi Tian was calm, and he couldn’t find Han Jue anymore.
 “Dark Forbidden Lord, what do you want?”
 Immeasurable Destruction Venerable frowned in confusion.
 What was the deeper meaning of that question?
 …
 Han Jue continued to wander in the Chaos
 after leaving Shi Tian.
 His actions in Shi Tian were only to release
 his nature. Everyone had a bad side and a good side to them. Mortals promoted the good path to protect themselves. How could invincible people decide their own good and evil? This was a question that Han Jue was curious about.
 After this, he lost interest in killing and felt that it was meaningless. As for benefiting all living beings, it was even more meaningless. All living beings couldn’t spy on the truth of the long years. They were only a fragment of time and were all concerned about themselves. Even if they knew that the Virtuous Sage was the Killing God, they could not change anything. They might even feel that it did not matter.
 From a later point of view, as long as the sins of history did not affect them, they could
 ignore this sin.
 It was worth celebrating as long as they benefited in the past and brought them a good
 life.
 From this point of view, good and evil was only suitable for mortals and for those with similar strength levels. Facing power that surpassed this level, they still had to return to the point where the strong were respected and the strong preyed on the weak.
 Han Jue thought as he moved forward.
 How to plan for everything in existence was something he, an invincible person, should
 consider.
 He didn’t want everything he knew to be like this forever. That would be too boring.
 Suppression was not feasible. Just like the Ninth Chaos, suppressing the development of the Chaos did not consolidate his status
 forever.
 Perhaps a fortuitous encounter like the system would appear in the future. Who could
 predict it?
 Han Jue could control everything, but the basic rule power of the blank domain was on par with him. This power might give birth to a new creation in the future.
 The battle between the Primordial Chaos and
 the Chaos erupted again when Han Jue left Shi
 Tian.
 Han Huang made a move.
 He suddenly descended to the highest battlefield and reversed the situation,
 forcefully suppressing the Chaos. Everyone below the Great Dao Sage Realm died. Some
 early and mid-stage Great Dao Sages even had their bodies and souls destroyed.
 Han Huang was ruthless. Previously, the Great Dao Sages would leave a way out when
 they fought.
 To put it bluntly, the Great Dao Sages on both sides treated the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity as a trial and not a battle of life and
 death.
 “Hmph, that’s enough. Two Great Dao World Lords, appear!”
 Han Huang, who was like a war god, looked
 down at the Chaos and smiled disdainfully. With that, the clones of the Immeasurable Destruction Venerable and the Chaotic Consciousness appeared behind him.
 “All of you, retreat. Although I don’t know
 why you support the Primordial Chaos, I want to personally deal with them!”
 Han Huang frowned and glanced coldly at the two Dao Creator clones behind him. The Formless Transcendent Deity only smiled. He looked at Han Huang as if he was
 looking at a junior, so he did not care. The Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity was very
 unhappy, but he was absolutely loyal to Han
 Jue and didn’t dare to refute.
 “How arrogant!”
 Immeasurable Destruction Venerable was furious. He was suppressed by the Dark Forbidden Lord and could vent his anger on Han Huang.
 The three of them were already at the
 half-step Creation Realm. They were
 naturally terrifying when they fought. The
 entire Chaotic Space began to shake and the three thousand Great Dao shattered one after another.
 Even Han Jue, who was far away on the other
 side of the Chaos, saw the surrounding space tear apart.
 Han Jue would not act before the Ninth Chaos
 made a move.
 after another. Countless wandering living beings appeared in the Chaos.
 This was a dark era. All living beings didn’t
 know the battle of the Great Dao Sages. They could only feel the suffering. Millions of years later.
 Han Jue’s origin lifespan had already reached
 470 million years and he had accumulated
 another two Creation Heaven’s Chosen attempts.
 He could give the creation of mortals, but that
 Origin World. The stronger he was, the more impressive the Creation Heaven’s Chosen was. Han Jue could already sense the existence of
 the system after he became a Creator Lord. It was like a mark that was imprinted on his Dominator Origin. He could strip it away, he felt that there was no need.
 The current system was like a Dharma
 but
 treasure. He couldn’t abandon a Dharma treasure just because it was powerful. Moreover, Han Jue and the system were more
 like partners. They strengthened each other, and he still wanted to go further.
 The system was formed by the Creation Will
 of the blank domain. After countless enhancements from the inheritors, it was finally where it was today. It was essentially a Creation Rule, just like the Innate Great Creation of his descendants. It only existed in a way that Han Jue was familiar with in his
 previous life. The game system was easier for him to accept, understand, and master. Unknowingly, Han Jue arrived at a corner of the Chaos.
 There was an extremely huge tree here that connected countless space-time dimensions. It was regarded as a forbidden land by all
 living beings.
 Fusang Divine Tree!
 This was the Fusang Tree that Han Jue had once nurtured. It left him in order to
 She had transformed after all these years with the Primordial Ancestor God’s help. However, no matter where she went, the power that controlled space and time would follow, causing many worlds to collapse. She had even been expelled by the Supreme Rules and had no choice but to return to her true form. Han Jue regained his original appearance and approached the Fusang Tree. He shed his divine light. Because his cultivation realm was too high, the sleeping Fusang Tree didn’t sense his arrival.
 “How are you?” Han Jue asked. With that
 said, the leaves of the Fusang Tree began to tremble, causing countless past and future
 space-time to tremble.
 “Master… why are you here?” the Fusang
 “No… I…”
 The high and mighty Fusang Tree was as nervous as a mortal meeting an immortal.
