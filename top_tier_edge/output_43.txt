 Han Jue held the Book of Misfortune and started to hesitate.
 What should he do with Pangu?
 No, the Chaotic Consciousness would definitely scheme again before he achieved his goal if he cursed him to death.
 Why wait for Pangu and the Fiendcelestials to fight before Han Jue cursed and reached a situation where both sides were injured to buy himself time to develop?
 There was no need for Han Jue to end this calamity directly. He could prolong it.
 Then, he would wait until they fought.
 Han Jue put away the Book of Misfortune and perked up before continuing to cultivate.
 The news of Pangu’s revival spread to the Heavenly Dao. As the providence sects promoted it, all living beings also learned about this matter.
  Some supported the Divine Might Heavenly Sage, while others supported Pangu.
 However, overall, more living beings supported the Divine Might Heavenly Sage.
 Pangu was too old for all living beings to remember. His legends were also very short. On the other hand, the Divine Might Heavenly Sage was more familiar.
 In Han Jue’s previous life, it was just like how the humans knew that a Creation God wanted to deal with Bodhisattva Guan Yin. Most people would support the latter.
 He was also the most mysterious Sage and only knew how to cultivate in seclusion.
 The current Heavenly Dao was filled with internal and external troubles. Pangu was attacking from the outside, and there was resentment accumulated from the rules of peace.
 The Immeasurable Calamity was about to blow again.
 Many mighty figures had already gathered around Qin Ling. They were all enemies of the Buddhist Sect or cultivators who were dissatisfied with the world.
 They were all waiting for Qin Ling to break through.
 Once he became a Pseudo-Sage, it would be time to start a war with the Buddhist Sect.
 The Buddhist Sect also knew about this, but they were helpless. They couldn’t target Qin Ling again with a groundless accusation. Qin Ling had already been suppressed for a hundred thousand years. It would be against the righteousness of peace if they attacked him again.
 Time passed.
 Year after year passed.
 On this day.
 Han Jue suddenly opened his eyes.
 He had been in seclusion for 9,732 years.
 He took out the Book of Misfortune. Through his clone, he already knew that the Fiendcelestials had already collided with Pangu.
 Dozens of Chaotic Fiendcelestials fought Pangu angrily. Layers of space shattered and the Primordial Void appeared as soon as the battle began. Han Jue’s clone was skiving. He was not the only one. Many Fiendcelestials were also the same. It was mainly the Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial fighting Pangu.
 Pangu would turn the tables sooner or later if this continued.
 Han Jue started cursing.
 His Dharmic powers surged into the Book of Misfortune and he heaved a sigh of relief.
 He could curse! It seemed that Pangu did not have the Karma Bead!
 With Han Jue’s interference, Pangu was indeed affected and couldn’t end the battle in half a day.
 Five days later, Pangu had already begun to suppress all the Fiendcelestials. The Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial was already severely injured and half of his Dao Soul had been severed. Although he could cultivate it back, he needed time.
 Han Jue’s lifespan began to decrease.
 As he cursed, he used his clone’s eyes to watch the battle.
 Without the Heaven-Opening Axe, Pangu fought with a saber. This saber was a bone saber. The blade was wide and larger than his body. At first glance, he thought it was another Heaven-Opening Axe.
 Pangu did not have any profound Mystical Powers or spells. He relied on his grand movements and powerful body.
 There was no defense. He attacked without restraint!
 As Han Jue began to curse Pangu with his lifespan, wisps of black aura began to overflow from Pangu’s body, slowing down his battle speed.
 The Fiendcelestials’ morale soared when they saw this.
 Pangu was about to collapse?
 The Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial noticed the black aura around Pangu and was shocked.
 That was… the Dark Forbidden Lord?!
 The Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial was surprised. Why did the Dark Forbidden Lord help him?
 Could it be that Pangu was also a threat to the Dark Forbidden Lord?
 That made sense. Once Pangu became stronger and swept through the Chaos, how could the Dark Forbidden Lord realize his ambitions?
 From the Dark Forbidden Lord’s performance, this fellow definitely had the ambition to plot against the Chaos!
 With that thought, the Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial attacked again, preparing to kill Pangu together.
 On the other side, Han Jue’s lifespan began to decrease.
 As he attacked, Pangu began to be beaten.
 “Pangu, you are indeed powerful. You fought so many Chaotic Fiendcelestials alone, and there are even Great Dao Supreme existences. They are actually not your match. You are so strong, you indeed need to be titled.” Han Jue thought silently.
 From the way Pangu crushed the Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial, Han Jue was very likely not his match.
 It was just nice to let Pangu be severely injured and rest for a period of time, giving him time to develop.
 When Han Jue’s lifespan was deducted by nearly 5 quadrillion years, the Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial severely injured Pangu. Pangu’s arms turned into ashes, but his aura was still ferocious.
 However, Pangu was not a ferocious beast. After fighting for a while more and confirming that he could not win, he could only retreat.
 The other Fiendcelestials followed suit. Immediately after, news of Pangu being severely injured appeared in Han Jue’s emails.
 In the end, the mysterious mighty figure saved Pangu.
 The Fiendcelestial side won!
 The Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial roared angrily. Its voice pierced through layers of space and shook the world.
 Han Jue put down the Book of Misfortune and sighed.
 Pangu!
 Although Pangu had lost and fled, he felt that he had not lost.
 His blood was ignited by Pangu.
 He had to fight Pangu in this life, but not now!
 With the Chaotic Consciousness behind him, it was impossible for Pangu to lose in a one-on-one situation.
 Then again, Pangu had only been born not long ago, but he could already suppress a Great Dao Supreme…
 Was there really someone born with unparalleled strength?
 Han Jue looked at the Daoist temple next door and saw his son through Xing Hongxuan’s abdomen.
 Han Jue suddenly looked forward to his son’s birth.
 That was unless Han Jue jumped out of the Primordial Fiendcelestial’s identity.
 Could there be a higher level?
 Han Jue felt that it was possible.
 The previous Primordial Fiendcelestial had died because of the appearance of the Chaos.
 But why didn’t he stop the Chaos?
 Could it be that the Chaos was stronger than him?
 Could it be the Chaotic Consciousness?
 It was not to the extent that the Chaotic Consciousness was only a Dao Creator.
 Han Jue suspected that the Creator Lord was the previous Primordial Fiendcelestial. He might be pursuing greater power and only gave the Chaos a chance because he failed.
 The strongest in the current Chaos was only a Dao Creator.
 Wait?
 Outside the Chaos?
 “I want to know if there are existences beyond the Dao Creator Realm outside the Chaos?”
  (1 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [No]
 Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief.
 He asked again, “How strong is the strongest existence outside the Chaos?”
 Outside the Chaos was a blank domain. There couldn’t be living beings, but what if there was a living being that was not what he knew?
 Just like the Inauspicious Evil!
 [The Great Dao Supreme who is imprisoned by a blank domain. There is no life or freedom.)
 The Chaos was already endless. Han Jue would start to question if there really was the strongest if there was a wider space or stronger existence outside the Chaos!


 The news that Pangu had fled with heavy injuries quickly spread in the Chaos. However, the Chaos was too great, so the news did not spread quickly.
 The Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial was very scheming. It deliberately mentioned the Dark Forbidden Lord when it spread this matter, saying that if not for him, they would definitely lose.
 Although it was the truth, it also pulled the Dark Forbidden Lord out again and even flattered him. Pangu also knew of the Dark Forbidden Lord’s existence.
 Heavenly Court!
 It was hundreds of years later when the Evil Heavenly Emperor learned of Pangu’s defeat.
 “Is the Dark Forbidden Lord out again? Even Pangu was severely injured by the curse. He’s too powerful.”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor sighed, his tone intriguing
 The three Divine Generals were in the hall. Black Heaven General said, “Your Majesty, Pangu will probably rest for a period of time. Should the Heavenly Court’s expansion plan continue?”
 Because of the battle between Pangu and the Chaotic Fiendcelestial, the Evil Heavenly Emperor was worried that the Heavenly troops would be accidentally injured during their mission, so he retracted his troops and told them to rest.
  The Evil Heavenly Emperor said, “There’s no hurry. The situation is unknown. Let’s wait and see. What if Pangu is lively tomorrow? The existence of the Chaotic Fiendcelestial is something we can’t guess.”
 He sighed.
 He had once had two Chaotic Fiendcelestials.
 His heart was filled with regret every time he thought about this.
 The reason why the Heavenly Court did not expand was mainly that there were no more Chaotic Fiendcelestials.
 Not only were the two new Divine Generals inferior to the previous Han Tuo and Yi Tian, but they also did not do their best.
 Not all the immortals supported the Evil Heavenly Emperor to continue expanding.
 More immortals felt that consolidating the existing forces was the most important.
 Black Heaven General was silent for a moment before saying, “Your Majesty, do you know the Buddhist World?”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor said, “Of course, I know. The Lord of the Buddhist World is still Tuo’er’s disciple-nephew.”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor understood, and his thoughts wandered
 “Is he really that powerful?”
 “Yes. Even the Great Dao Divine Spirit, the Divine Robe Daoist, has personally visited and even given him a precious treasure.”
 “Then, I have to go take a look.”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor narrowed his eyes. The Black Heaven General stopped talking. The other two Divine Generals did not say anything, but they also lowered their heads slightly.
 Twenty thousand years passed.
 Han Jue was nearly 1.8 million years old.
 Pangu had indeed stopped after being severely injured. At least, he couldn’t be seen in his circle of friends.
 On this day, Han Jue opened his eyes.
 It was mainly because Chu Shiren had sent him a dream not long ago, but he had not used the Invocation Technique. It was probably not an urgent matter.
 Han Jue sent a dream to Chu Shiren.
 In the dream.
 Chu Shiren opened his eyes and saw that it was Han Jue. He immediately stood up and bowed.
 “What is it?” Han Jue asked.
 Chu Shiren explained the reason.
 It turned out that a prodigy had been born in the Buddhist World, but he was warlike by nature. Coincidentally, the Evil Heavenly Emperor came and wanted to nurture this prodigy. Chu Shiren was a little hesitant. The reason why he did not directly reject it was that the Evil Heavenly Emperor had indeed nurtured Han Tuo very well.
 “Grandmaster, can we trust the Evil Heavenly Emperor?” Chu Shiren asked.
 Han Jue said, “If you mention me and he makes a promise, we can believe it. The key is, are you willing to give him away?”
 Chu Shiren smiled bitterly. “I have to. This kid is too noisy. He sparred with the disciples of the Buddhist World and severely injured them every time. It’s probably not a good thing to keep him around. I really don’t know how to correct his personality.
 “It’s good to follow the Evil Heavenly Emperor. I can only let go after experiencing
  it.”
 Han Jue asked curiously, “Why can the Buddhist World give birth to such a prodigy?”
 Chu Shiren said, “After all, it’s a world formed by the Great Dao. It has endless creation. The Chaos is a world woven by the three thousand Great Dao. In the future, an existence stronger than the Chaotic Fiendcelestial will appear. I think it’s possible.”
 Han Jue couldn’t help but think of the Heavenly Emperor.
 Why didn’t the Heavenly Dao have such a stunning prodigy?
 Although the Heavenly Dao had many geniuses, none of them caught Han Jue’s eye.
 Perhaps the Heavenly Dao was not the Great Dao. The limit of Creation was still a little lacking
 After chatting for a while, the dream ended.
 Han Jue didn’t take this to heart.
 However, half a day later, the Evil Heavenly Emperor sent him a dream. In the dream, he thanked Han Jue and promised that he would nurture the Buddhist Spirit into a genius and let it return to the Buddhist World in the future.
 He had helped the Buddhist World nurture geniuses and they had helped him expand his territory. It was a win-win situation. He did not expect the Buddhist Spirit to serve him forever.
 en
 However, he believed that as the Heavenly Court became stronger, sooner or later, a Buddhist spirit that truly belonged to the Heavenly Court would appear.
 After the dream ended, Han Jue looked at the Heavenly Dao next.
 He wanted to find unparalleled prodigies in the Heavenly Dao.
 Xia Zhizun and the others were a little weak.
 At the very least, it had to be an existence like Qin Ling
 After searching for a while, Han Jue really found one.
 He was also born in the Heavenly Dao Race. He was born three hundred years ago and was still an Immortal Emperor.
 What realm was Han Jue when he was three hundred years old?
 He counted with his fingers and discovered that this child indeed had a background.
 This child was called Jiang Jueshi. He was the elder brother of the disciple of the Human School, Jiang Dugu. Unlike Jiang Dugu, who had always been growing, Jiang Jueshi had passed away in meditation when he reached the Deity Realm. After that, he would continue to pass away in meditation every time he cultivated to the Deity Realm. One life after another, his talent increased every time. Now, he had already lived for a hundred thousand lifetimes and his reincarnation body had already passed several calamities.
 Even the Dao Destruction Mystical Power did not destroy his soul.
 Because he had passed away after reaching the Deity Realm, Jiang Jueshi had never appeared. Jiang Dugu also thought that his elder brother had long died.
 In this life, Jiang Jueshi seemed to be on the verge of soaring.
 He wondered if he would still die in peace.
 In addition, the Sages did not seem to sense his existence. He was too low profile and his providence was extremely thin. If not for a Great Dao Sage like Han Jue deliberately searching for geniuses, he might not have discovered him.
Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m Han Jue was looking forward to it. He closed his eyes and continued cultivating.
 Ten thousand years later, he opened his eyes.
  He looked at Jiang Jueshi again.
 In ten thousand years, this fellow had already reincarnated twice.
 He did not reveal his fame in either life. He secretly cultivated and quietly passed away, as if he did not exist in the Heavenly Dao at all.
 Han Jue was very concerned about him.
 Why did he do this?
 Reincarnate continuously to increase his potential?
 His potential was already high enough. Why didn’t he stop?
 Han Jue decided to create a clone. When Jiang Jueshi reincarnated again, he would let the clone go and take in a disciple. Four thousand years later, Jiang Jueshi died in a valley. His soul entered the netherworld. Even the King of Hell did not sense the terrifying potential in his soul and dismissed him as a mortal. He reincarnated again without anyone knowing.
 In this life, he was born in a village. His parents were still alive and he had siblings.
 Jiang Jueshi had experienced all sorts of situations. He experienced life in the royal family, a family of suffering, a family of wealth, and even evil. However, he had always silently escaped karma and found a place to cultivate alone.


 In the forest, behind a huge rock, a two or three-year-old child was meditating and cultivating
 His facial features were exquisite and his face was flushed. He had the grace of a girl.
 He was Jiang Jueshi.
 He had concealed himself deeply and pretended to drink Meng Po’s soup. His memories were still there, so he had started cultivating when he was born. However, he had hidden it very well and no one had discovered him.
 At this moment, he suddenly heard footsteps.
 Jiang Jueshi immediately opened his eyes and collapsed against the stone. His eyes instantly turned red, as if he had cried.
 A figure arrived in front of him.
 It was an old Daoist, formed by Han Jue’s clone. His back was stooped, but a hint of Han Jue’s main body could still be seen between his brows.
  Han Jue pretended to be surprised and muttered, “There’s actually such talent in the world!”
 He picked Jiang Jueshi up and walked towards the village.
 Jiang Jueshi drooled and scratched with his small hands. He was pure and cute.
 He felt very helpless.
 He encountered a cultivator who wanted to take him in as a disciple again. He had experienced so many reincarnations. Such a situation was not rare, so he did not panic and would slowly deal with it in the future.
 Han Jue found Jiang Jueshi’s parents and expressed that he was a cultivator and was willing to take Jiang Jueshi in as his disciple. He taught him in the village. His parents were very excited and knelt down to thank him.
 ere
 As time passed, Han Jue also integrated into it and taught Jiang Jueshi cultivation. He only taught him ordinary cultivation techniques. However, in order to deal with it, Jiang Jueshi also cultivated according to the cultivation technique he taught.
 Twenty years later, Jiang Jueshi, who had grown up, bid farewell and prepared to wander the world. In the end, Han Jue insisted on following him, making him helpless.
 The master and disciple began to walk around the world.
 Three thousand years later.
 Han Jue’s hair was already white. He stayed in a simple Daoist temple by the river with Jiang Jueshi.
 Compared to three thousand years ago, Han Jue looked older. His aura was like silk and he couldn’t even open his eyes.
 Jiang Jueshi sat beside Han Jue and opened his eyes. He said softly, “Master, my lifespan is up.”
 Han Jue didn’t move. Jiang Jueshi had to repeat himself.
 Jiang Jueshi said, “I don’t understand it, either. Perhaps it’s fate. The heavens gave me talent, but they also deprived me of my lifespan.”
 Han Jue stopped talking.
 Jiang Jueshi glanced at him and sighed.
 In this life, he owed his master the most.
 He did not tell his master that he had already reached the Deity Realm. He was prepared to die already.
 But he suddenly felt a little reluctant. He didn’t know what his master would do after he died.
 1
 Jiang Jueshi only felt a little guilty, but he had experienced a hundred thousand reincarnations and his Dao heart was as firm as a rock.
 “See you in the next life. No, there’s no next life.”
 Jiang Jueshi thought to himself. He had severed ties with countless relatives and wives. Once he reincarnated, it would be very difficult to meet them again.
 After countless reincarnations, he might have a chance to meet him, but he did not intend to befriend him.
 The karma that was severed should not be reattached.
 Several decades later.
 Jiang Jueshi quietly reincarnated and came to another mortal world.
 In this life, he was born into a rich family.
 At the age of three, snow fell from the sky. The world was vast and snow covered the city.
 Jiang Jueshi was quietly cultivating in the courtyard when he suddenly heard the servants passing by talking about what was happening outside. “Is that old beggar dead or alive?”
 “I’m not sure, but lying at the entrance of our residence is not a good idea.”
 “Master has already sent someone to find a doctor.”
 Jiang Jueshi looked at the old beggar lying on the ground and suddenly frowned.
 “Master?”
 Jiang Jueshi had a strange expression. Wasn’t this his master in his previous life?
 The weak old beggar slowly opened his eyes and met his gaze.
 The old beggar suddenly widened his eyes and flipped over, startling the crowd.
 The old beggar stared at Jiang Jueshi and muttered, “Such potential… There’s actually a second person in the world? Could it be the reincarnation of my disciple?”
 The young Jiang Jueshi’s mouth twitched.
 It was really his master!
 How did this old man find this place?
 He could cross worlds in just a few decades?
 Jiang Jueshi suddenly smelled a conspiracy and instinctively became vigilant. This was the first time he had encountered such a thing in the previous hundred thousand reincarnations.
 Ten thousand years passed.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and looked at the Heavenly Dao first.
 Jiang Jueshi was still entangled with his clone. After meeting in his second life, Jiang Jueshi was originally wary. Later, he discovered that his master had met him by chance, so the master and disciple began to wander the world again.
 Although he said that he was wandering the world, he was actually finding a place to hide and cultivate. He was isolated from the world and did not even have friends, let alone enemies.
 Han Jue admired Jiang Jueshi even more.
 This fellow was not like a human. He was too determined, like a cultivation machine.
 In order to make Jiang Jueshi no longer suspect his clone, Han Jue made the clone swear. “Even if I reincarnate for ten thousand lifetimes, I will definitely find my disciple and help him break the shackles of fate and obtain immortality.”
 Jiang Jueshi was extremely afraid when he heard this.
 Was this old man really going to pester him?
 However, the old man was only in the Soul Formation Realm and should not live for long.
 Jiang Jueshi passed away again after he reached the Deity Realm.
 Several decades later.
 Jiang Jueshi was born into the royal family and was the prince.
 He was secretly happy. This time, that old man could not reach him, right?
  Unlike in his previous life, Han Jue was much younger in this life, as if he was in his forties. When Jiang Jueshi learned that this fellow had actually attained the Grand Unity Dao Fruit, his lifespan increased greatly and his essence, energy, and spirit also increased greatly.
 This dogshit luck…
 Just like that, Jiang Jueshi was pestered by Han Jue again.
 In the demonic path’s abyss, turbid mist filled the air.
 Han Tuo and Yi Tian were fighting and were on par.
 The Devil Ancestor Lu Yuan suddenly appeared and said, “I have a mission for you.”
 Han Tuo and Yi Tian immediately stopped.
 They came in front of the Devil Ancestor Lu Yuan with anticipation.
 They had been here for too long and wanted to go out!
 They were not the masters of bitter cultivation, to begin with. They needed to fight and constantly break through in battle, constantly surpassing their limits!


 “What mission? Who?” Yi Tian asked excitedly. He clenched his fists and his body emitted a sound like the roar of a tiger.
 Lu Yuan sized them up for a while before saying, “Break through the Divine Dao!”
 Han Tuo asked curiously, “What Divine Dao?”
 “The Divine Dao is the path to the Great Dao Divine Spirit.”
 “The Great Dao Divine Spirit is not formed by the Great Dao?”
 “Indeed, but something has to be different. This will be the beginning of the change. Prepare yourself. We’ll leave in a thousand years.”
 Lu Yuan turned into demonic Qi and dissipated the moment he finished speaking.
 Yi Tian smiled and said, “Hahaha, we’re going to be Great Dao Divine Spirits? I heard that Great Dao Divine Spirits can control an area of the Chaos!”
 The Devil Ancestor did not nurture them because he loved talent!
 They were only pawns!
 Year after year passed.
 Han Jue was immersed in seclusion cultivation. Unknowingly, another fifty thousand years passed.
 He opened his eyes and smiled.
 His cultivation level had improved again!
 It had been five hundred thousand years since his last breakthrough. He was getting closer and closer to the perfected Great Dao Primordial Chaos Realm.
 He opened the emails.
 Looking at his friends, nothing major had happened recently. Everything was fine. None of the emails were worth his attention.
 Han Jue focused on Jiang Jueshi.
 He was truly suitable to be his disciple.
 Not many of Han Jue’s disciples truly matched his personality. The Black Hell Chicken, the Chaotic Heavenly Dog, and the other personal disciples had only been forcefully corrected by him.
 He had to take in this kid!
 Apart from his personality, Jiang Jueshi’s talent growth method also interested him.
 He couldn’t see through him even as a Great Dao Sage. However, one thing was certain. Jiang Jueshi did not have an impressive previous life.
 This was the development of the Chaos. Juniors always surpassed their predecessors. Otherwise, it would be very difficult for the Chaos to develop.
 If the earliest Great Dao Sages could see how their descendants rose, it would be very easy to monopolize this realm. In fact, there were always cultivators who advanced and stepped into the Great Dao.
 “I probably can’t keep pestering him like this. I have to find a chance to really die.”
 Han Jue thought silently. He could feel that Jiang Jueshi was beginning to dislike the clone.
 In a corner of the Immortal World.
 The old Han Jue and Jiang Jueshi sat together.
 Jiang Jueshi glanced at his master beside him, feeling conflicted.
 He had reached the Deity Realm again. It was time for him to die.
 He felt that his master’s background was not simple. He might be someone’s pawn.
 Han Jue suddenly opened his eyes and said softly, “Disciple, are you going to die again?”
 Jiang Jueshi was silent.
 Han Jue said faintly, “I can’t see through your fate. You don’t seem to want to escape it, either. Perhaps you’re worried about some existence. I’m an Immortal Emperor now, after all. I’m willing to help you.”
 Jiang Jueshi rolled his eyes and said angrily, “How?”
 His master was usually indecent, especially after his cultivation level increased. He was always unreliable and liked to tease him. “I’ll give up my cultivation to help you escape fate!”
 “Hehe.”
 Jiang Jueshi felt that he was being impulsive again.
 Han Jue slowly stood up and walked towards the sky.
 “I’ve lived for a long time and experienced all the situations in the world. I’ve been happy, cried, blessed, suffered, angry, hated, and regretted.
 Han Jue’s voice echoed in the mountains. In an instant, the weather changed and thunder rumbled.
 Jiang Jueshi hesitated.
 How could he have the will of the heavens? The reason he died was that he wanted to die.
 But if his master sacrificed himself now, wouldn’t that be what he wanted?
 Although his master treated him very well, it had already begun to affect his cultivation.
 Under his gaze, Han Jue turned into a beam of light and dissipated. Immediately after, the thunderclouds parted and a pillar of light shot down, absorbing the light.
 Then, the pillar of light suddenly landed on Jiang Jueshi. It was so fast that he couldn’t dodge it in time.
 Jiang Jueshi sensed the providence of the Heavenly Dao.
 His master was not joking. He had really sacrificed himself to fulfill his wish.
 Everything happened too quickly. Jiang Jueshi couldn’t help but be stunned.
 He did not expect to be separated by life and death today.
 unn
 Jiang Jueshi smiled. “This old man must be messing with me. We’ll definitely meet again in the next life.”
 He stopped thinking and moved somewhere, preparing to die.
 Several decades later.
 The ten-year-old Jiang Jueshi sat at the entrance of the courtyard and looked at the bustling streets. He was silently lost in thought.
 A woman returned from buying groceries and saw him sitting at the door. She smiled and said, “Young Master, what are you thinking about again?”
 Jiang Jueshi came back to his senses and smiled. “Nothing. I wonder what we’re eating tonight?”
 “I’ll cook fish for you tonight.”
 “Thank you, Auntie.”
 Then, Jiang Jueshi continued to stare blankly.
 “Why aren’t you here yet?”
 Time passed quickly.
 Thirty thousand years passed.
 When he walked out of the town he had lived in for twenty years, he saw an old man under an old tree not far away. He was sitting cross-legged with a pipe in his mouth.
 Jiang Jueshi’s expression changed as he carefully walked over.
 Could it be him?
 He’s here again?
 The old man opened one eye and glanced at him. He grinned and said, “Young Master, do you want to cultivate? I have the Pangu Body Tempering Technique, the Divine Might Heavenly Sage’s Invincible Technique, and the Xuan Du Divine Refinement Technique. Which one do you want? The price is negotiable!”
 He took out manuals from his clothes.
 Jiang Jueshi was stunned. He shook his head with a bitter smile and left.
 The old man cursed silently and put away the manual.
  Jiang Jueshi walked towards the official road.
 He muttered to himself, “Why is this happening… I clearly don’t like him very much, I even dislike him…
 me.”
 “So, he didn’t scheme against me or use me. He really only treated me as his disciple. His heart really ached for me.”
 Jiang Jueshi’s eyes became firm.
 He was not a mortal and would not be immersed in sorrow.
 In that case!


 Han Jue opened his eyes after cultivating in seclusion for thirty thousand years. It wasn’t because of Jiang Jueshi, but because Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du had sent him a voice transmission.
 As for Jiang Jueshi, Han Jue didn’t plan to care anymore. He had already planted karma and would accept it in the future.
 He believed that this experience was unforgettable for Jiang Jueshi.
 One day, Jiang Jueshi would face trouble that he could not resist. He would then stop.
 Han Jue came to the 33rd Heaven.
 He noticed that the aura of the cultivators here had increased. At least a million cultivators were scattered in the various Sage Dao Fields.
 It was probably to carry out Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du’s Hundred Sages development plan.
 Han Jue came to the Universal Hall. He met Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du in another space. It looked like the Universal Hall, but there were tens of thousands of Dao Seekers cultivating in the true Universal Hall.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du smiled. “How’s Fellow Daoist Han’s cultivation recently?”
  Han Jue said, “It’s alright. Why are you being polite to me? Just say what you want to say.”
 “It’s like this. The Divine Dao has been opened. The leader of the Divine Spirits has announced that he is willing to give the Chaotic lifeforms a chance. All living beings can challenge the Divine Dao, and there will be five spots for the Great Dao Divine Spirit. Fellow Daoist Han, do you want to go?” Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du smiled.
 There was a hint of anticipation in his tone.
 The Great Dao Divine Spirit was not simple!
 Although Han Jue had killed a Great Dao Divine Spirit before, they were supreme in the Chaos and controlled the Chaotic Order. Furthermore, his cultivation would advance by leaps and bounds after obtaining the Divine Spirit’s providence.
 Most importantly, his identity would change!
 The Great Dao Divine Spirit was like the Emperor of the mortal world, the Immortal God of the Immortal World, the legitimate supreme authority!
 Han Jue said, “Forget it, I’m not going. It’s too dangerous.”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du asked in confusion, “Are you still afraid of danger now?”
 He thought that Han Jue was already invincible.
 Even his master had not killed thirteen Lives at once, much less slaughtered a Great Dao Divine Spirit!
 “Of course. There’s always someone stronger. Fellow Daoist Xuan Du, we still have to be cautious and not be too reckless. It’s not easy for the Heavenly Dao to develop. Sometimes, it’s good to just accept it. Don’t always be the first to stand out,” Han Jue said meaningfully. Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du was deep in thought.
 Na
 He didn’t care about what the others said, but it meant something different when Han Jue spoke.
 However, the Chaos was huge. The domain covered by the Heavenly Dao was like a drop in the ocean. It was not worth mentioning.
 The Great Dao Divine Spirit’s positions would be fought for by the entire Chaos. How could it be affected by the Heavenly Dao?
 The more Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du thought about it, the more afraid he became.
 Han Jue said, “Are there any good geniuses in the Heavenly Dao recently? I mean, geniuses like Li Daokong and Yi Tian.”
 He was also depressed. He felt that the Heavenly Dao was lacking something.
 He couldn’t sense what was wrong.
 There were many geniuses, but few were stunning
 Perhaps because it was too peaceful, it restricted their talent.
 There was a reason why heroes appeared in troubled times.
 Some geniuses needed the environment and the stimulation and motivation.
 Han Jue said, “There’s no need to make it public. It’s fine as long as the providence sects don’t interfere. It’s time for the immortals to rise.”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du nodded.
 Then, he mentioned the Buddhist World.
 The Buddhist World developed extremely well, especially after a Freedom mighty figure joined it. It was even more attractive to the Chaotic lifeforms.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du knew that the Lord of the Buddhist World was Han Jue’s grand-disciple. Speaking of it, he couldn’t help but sigh.
 How could the Heavenly Dao not have people with great providence and top geniuses?
 Didn’t you take them all away?
  The two of them chatted for a long time before Han Jue left.
 He came to Ji Xianshen’s Dao Field. There were also many cultivators in the Dao Field. Most of them were from the Heavenly Race and the Calamity Race. The two of them came to the palace deep inside.
 Ji Xianshen was still nervous when facing Han Jue.
 “Master, I…” Ji Xianshen opened his mouth, but he did not know what to say.
 Han Jue asked him how his cultivation had been recently and how the Heavenly Race was managing. He didn’t seem to have any grudges. Unknowingly, Ji Xianshen was no longer nervous.
 Thinking about it carefully, it was ridiculous.
 How could his conflict with Fang Liang affect Han Jue?
 Their battle was probably child’s play in his eyes.
 Han Jue said, “Cultivate well. Don’t slack off when you reach the Sage Realm. Achieve the Great Dao as soon as possible, understand?”
 Ji Xianshen said excitedly, “I understand!”
 So Master has such expectations for me?
 Ji Xianshen was both surprised and ashamed.
 He didn’t expect Han Jue to think highly of him.
 He was ashamed that the difference between them was really too great.
 Thinking of Han Jue, he rarely cared about the Hidden Sect, but it was still developing very well.
 Should he let go?
 Han Jue didn’t say anything else and started to preach the Dao to Ji Xianshen alone.
 A hundred years later, he found Fang Liang and Su Qi and preached the Dao to them.
 After hundreds of years, he returned to the Daoist temple to continue cultivating.
 He saw Ji Xianshen’s excitement and enjoyed
 it.
 This kid was still thinking about his master.
 Time passed quickly.
 A hundred thousand years passed in the blink of an eye!
 Han Jue was about to reach two million years old. He was looking forward to it.
 The two-million-year threshold should give a good reward.
 On this day, he opened his eyes and habitually checked his emails.
 At this moment…
 He suddenly felt something and looked over.
  The providence of the Heavenly Dao changed drastically!
 It came from an island outside the Immortal World.
 It was Jiang Jueshi.
 Jiang Jueshi sat on the peak of the island. His robes fluttered as his Dharmic powers increased steadily, shaking the heavenly phenomena.
 Two Mystic Divine Origin!
 Three Mystic Divine Origin!
 Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal!
 In just a day, Jiang Jueshi directly became a Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal. He kept waving his hands and transformed into a strange phenomenon around him. A purple wheel appeared between his eyebrows, looking like a Taiji Painting.
 “It’s time to awaken the accumulation of 150,000 lifetimes,” Jiang Jueshi muttered to himself. The purple wheel between his eyebrows spun at high speed, crazily absorbing the Spirit Qi of Heaven and Earth.
 The boundless Spirit Qi and Connate Qi of the entire Immortal World were shaken. With him as the center, a terrifying storm formed, covering billions of kilometers of sea and startling the 33rd Heaven.
