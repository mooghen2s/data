 The current Immortal World did not lack prodigies.
 There was always someone better.
 Han Yu smiled. “He’s different.”
 “Different in what way?”
 “You will understand in the future.”
 Tian Yong curled his lips, feeling that Han Yu was biased.
  At this moment, a golden light soared into the sky and pierced through the sea of clouds. In the pillar of light, a dragon soared into the sky and rose in front of Han Yu and the other person.
 The two of them looked over with stunned expressions.
 Qin Ling’s halberd lifted the gray-robed Daoist up and blood splattered all over the ground.
 The gray-robed Daoist’s chest was pierced. His eyes widened in shock.
 Qin Ling was also stunned. He hurriedly put down the golden halberd and looked nervously at the gray-robed Daoist. “Are you alright?” Qin Ling helped the gray-robed Daoist to sit down.
 He was only sparring and did not want to kill anyone.
 The gray-robed Daoist immediately pulled out his halberd and meditated on the spot, circulating his energy to heal his injuries.
 Qin Ling was extremely nervous.
 The gray-robed Daoist was shocked and felt more aggrieved and embarrassed.
 He had almost been killed!
 If Qin Ling had not stopped in time, he would have been split into two by the golden halberd.
 The gray-robed Daoist wished he could find a hole to hide in.
 He no longer had the face to take in a disciple. He only wanted to leave as soon as possible.
 At this moment, a figure suddenly landed.
 It was Tian Yong.
 Tian Yong was the reincarnation of the son of the Calamity Race’s Heavenly Calamity Emperor. His potential was terrifying and he had obtained Han Yu’s inheritance. He had long surpassed the Immortal Realm.
 He looked down at Qin Ling and said, “Take me as your master!”
 His tone was unquestionable!
 Qin Ling frowned.
 The gray-robed Daoist was furious.
 He had just been injured and was about to be intercepted?
 Tian Yong raised his right hand and made a grabbing gesture. A tall mountain dozens of kilometers away suddenly rose. Dust rose into the sky and shook the world.
 The gray-robed Daoist and Qin Ling were stunned.
 Tian Yong clenched his right hand and the peak shattered.
 Qin Ling widened his eyes.
 The gray-robed Daoist was also shocked.
 That peak was at least ten thousand feet tall. He didn’t know how to move mountains and seas like this!
 Tian Yong said expressionlessly, “Kneel down and acknowledge me as your master.”
 Qin Ling clenched his fists and gritted his teeth.
 Tian Yong said disdainfully, “What? You’re not convinced?”
 Qin Ling gritted his teeth. “My home is
 gone!”
 Tian Yong was stunned and looked embarrassed.
 He coughed and could no longer put on airs. “Disciple, follow me in the future. You and your mother don’t have to hide in the mountains.”
 Qin Ling was silent.
 He did want to go out for a walk.
 Time passed quickly.
 Han Jue opened his eyes again. Another five thousand years passed.
 His state became more and more ethereal. His eyes were profound as if they contained countless indescribable, wonderful techniques.
 “Soon,” Han Jue muttered to himself. His eyes finally revealed excitement, causing him to regain a trace of humanity.
 He opened the emails. To him, five thousand years was very fast, but in the mortal world, it was a new era.
 (Your good friend Divine Lord Peacock was cursed by a mysterious curse.]
 (Your good friend Evil Heavenly Emperor controls the power of darkness.)
 (Your good friend Empress Houtu was attacked by a mysterious Dao Devil) x8290211
 [Your son Han Tuo has entered the Great Dao Trial Ground.]
  [Your good friend Pan Xin has entered the Ancient Desolate.]
 (Your descendant Han Yu has learned a Heavenly Dao Mystical Power.]
 (Your good friend Ancestor Xitian was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure. His soul fell into the cycle of the Great Dao and is enduring all the suffering in the world.]
 (Your good friend Huang Zuntian has obtained the power of origin. His cultivation has increased greatly.]
 Pan Xin had actually left the Heavenly Dao! What was this fellow trying to do? Han Jue frowned, worried that Pan Xin would attract enemies.
 Looking down, Ancestor Xitian’s encounter made him sigh.
 However, the Chaotic Consciousness was too powerful and Han Jue couldn’t help.
 Should he curse?
 However, that would cause endless trouble. Han Jue felt that his identity as the Dark Forbidden Lord was easily exposed. At least, his enemies thought that he was related to the Dark Forbidden Lord.
 “Can the Chaotic Consciousness barge into my Dao Field?” Han Jue asked in his mind.
 (1 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?)
 Continue!
 (Yes]
 Han Jue could only apologize to Ancestor Xitian.
 The two of them were not on good terms. He naturally did not have to risk his life for Ancestor Xitian. Moreover, it was useless even if he risked his life now.
 Han Jue continued to read the emails.
 After reading all the emails, he looked at the Immortal World.
 The current Immortal World was extremely exciting. It was unknown if it was because of the Sages, but prodigies were prevalent now. All kinds of legends and rankings regarding prodigies were spread throughout the various regions. Their glory even covered the mighty figures of the world.
 Han Jue suddenly saw Han Yu’s providence appear on the Heavenly Dao Providence Board. He had already entered the top hundred.
 Apart from the providence of the Human Race, there was also a strange providence on him. Even he couldn’t see it clearly.
 Han Jue pinched his fingers to deduce and revealed a strange expression.
 This strange providence came from one of Han Yu’s karma, his grand-disciple, Qin Ling. Qin Ling had cultivated for five hundred years and already had the cultivation of an Immortal Emperor. His cultivation speed was even more terrifying than Han Jue’s.
 VILTI
 Han Jue deduced Qin Ling’s background.
 He could not deduce it!
 Interesting!
 Han Jue had no choice but to use the derivation function.
 “I want to know Qin Ling’s background!”
 (Ten million years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 His value was a little high!
 At least for an Immortal Emperor.
 A line of words appeared in front of him.
 (Qin Ling: Rank Three Immortal Emperor, Heavenly Dao Divine Soul, Primordial World Overlord Body, Ancestral Dragon providence, Son of the Immeasurable Calamity, Son of Heaven and Earth]
 There were so many Connate providence traits?
 Han Jue raised his eyebrows. This was even more impressive than his opening.
 Could this be the Son of the Immeasurable Calamity that Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du mentioned?
 Why was he under Han Yu?
 Han Jue pinched his fingers again and deduced that the origin of this karma came from Li Daokong.
 It turned out that Li Daokong had discovered Qin Ling’s extraordinariness and asked Han Yu to accept him.
 Qin Ling’s appearance was actually noticed by the other Sages. Pan Xin happened to leave the Heavenly Dao and head to the Ancient Desolate, so he missed it. Li Daokong attacked immediately. The Sages who were on good terms with Han Jue tacitly agreed to support him. Emperor Xiao and Jin Shen were afraid of offending Han Jue, so they could only let go.
 Although Qin Ling was extraordinary, he had yet to show the providence of the Son of the Immeasurable Calamity. The Sages did not have the system to distinguish it. Countless geniuses in the Immortal World caused phenomena when they were born.
 The reason why Qin Ling attracted the attention of the Sages was because of the initiative of a five-clawed golden dragon.
 This five-clawed golden dragon was not simple. It had always been hiding in the depths of the Immortal World and had lived for countless years. Tracing its origin, it could be attributed to the Primordial Dragon Race.
 Han Jue began to observe Qin Ling.
  Qin Ling was cultivating on Buzhou Divine Mountain. His blood essence was powerful and his aura was imposing.
 Han Jue nodded.
 Han Yu was not bad. The disciples and grand-disciples he took in were all extraordinary. They all had powerful backgrounds.
 As long as Han Yu did not act recklessly, he could dominate the heavens in the future just by relying on his disciples.
 No matter what, Qin Ling was also a member of the Hidden Sect. It was a good thing.
 Many geniuses also appeared in the Hidden Sect outside the Hundred Peak Immortal River, but there was a missing person among the outer sect disciples.
 Apart from talent, a true prodigy also had to be famous!
 What was fame? It was the reputation of stepping on other people’s corpses!


 He retracted his gaze and started to visit Divine Lord Peacock in his dreams.
 Previously, he had seen Divine Lord Peacock suffer a mysterious curse and was worried that something would happen to him. The dream was above the Yellow Spring. Han Jue met Divine Lord Peacock in the image of the Dark Forbidden Lord.
 Divine Lord Peacock opened his eyes and heaved a sigh of relief when he saw that it was him.
 “Why are you being cursed?” Han Jue asked.
 Divine Lord Peacock looked at him in surprise and asked, “You can sense that?”
 Han Jue didn’t answer and replied with an attitude.
  Divine Lord Peacock waved his hand and said, “Don’t worry. Previously, I only placed the Karma Bead in a place to make it stronger. In the end, I gave that Fiendcelestial a chance.
 “Tsk tsk, he’s really the Curse Fiendcelestial. However, his curse is too weak. Even without the Karma Bead, he can’t curse me to death.”
 He had been defeated by the Inauspicious Divine Emperor previously. In the past tens of thousands of years, he had regained his confidence in dealing with the Curse Fiendcelestial.
 Han Jue asked, “You can’t kill him?”
 Divine Lord Peacock said, “The Chaotic Fiendcelestial is not that easy to kill. This fellow is not the main body. I can only chase after him and make him unable to rest.”
 Han Jue said, “Alright. If you can kill him, I’ll help you attain the Great Dao.”
 Divine Lord Peacock’s eyes lit up. “Really?”
 “Of course.”
 “Alright, just you wait. Even if it’s a million years or ten million years, I’ll definitely kill the Curse Fiendcelestial. To be honest, I don’t like him either. He’s so sneaky and sarcastic.”
 Hearing his words, Han Jue felt that he had been tricked.
 Then, he asked him about his recent encounters. Divine Lord Peacock didn’t hide anything
 During the pursuit of the Curse Fiendcelestial, Divine Lord Peacock had also encountered many cultivators and mysterious worlds.
 Because of the appearance of the Inauspicious Divine Emperor, Divine Lord Peacock suspected that a terrifying existence who controlled all the Dao Devils might also appear.
 Divine Lord Peacock asked, “What do you think about the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity?”
 Han Jue said, “I’m prepared. Continue your task in peace. As long as you kill the Curse Fiendcelestial, I’ll ensure that you survive the Great Dao Calamity.”
 Divine Lord Peacock was relieved.
 Han Jue didn’t say anything else and removed the dream.
 His greatest reliance was the Dao Field. As long as he attained the Great Dao, the Dao Field would definitely level up again. Once the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity began, he would directly use the Invocation Technique and forcefully summon all the disciples who had grasped the Invocation Technique back to transcend the tribulation together!
 If Divine Lord Peacock could kill the Curse Fiendcelestial, Han Jue would also teach him the Invocation Technique.
 Of course, if Divine Lord Peacock couldn’t do it, then don’t blame Han Jue for being cold and heartless.
 Inside the Daoist temple.
 Han Jue opened his eyes.
 “I want to know how long more the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity will take to arrive?”
 [1 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Tsk tsk, it was already equivalent to the value of a Dao Creator!
 Continue!
 [If there are no major changes, it will be in about 23 billion years.] Fortunately, it was far enough.
 However, this major change…
 Han Jue suddenly felt that it was not reliable. The Heavenly Dao Immeasurable Calamity had been brought forward.
 Could the major change be referring to him?
 Han Jue was secretly vigilant. He had to be more well-behaved in the future and not change the situation in the Chaos easily.
 “I want to know what the first battle of the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity is like.”
 Han Jue asked again in his mind.
 (1 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 Han Jue entered the illusion.
 He opened his eyes and discovered that he was standing in the void. Countless meteors floated in the surrounding dark space. They were very scattered among each other. A huge light ahead expelled the darkness.
 He narrowed his eyes and saw a huge head in the light. He couldn’t see its true appearance. He could only see the other party’s long hair fluttering like dragons.
 What a big head!
 Han Jue estimated that it was even larger than the entire Heavenly Dao. How exaggerated was this?
 Even though they were extremely far away, Han Jue could still feel how tiny he was.
 On the dragon’s head stood a burly figure. He held a golden halberd and wore silver chain armor. He wore a dragon’s head jade crown and looked mighty and domineering.
 Eh?
 Wasn’t this Han Yu’s grand-disciple, Qin Ling?
 This child would start the first battle of the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity?
 Figures appeared near the five-clawed golden dragon. All of them emitted powerful auras. The weakest was at the Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm.
 A vertical eye opened between Qin Ling’s eyebrows, and his three eyes turned red. He glared at the huge and majestic head in front of him and shouted angrily, “Children of the Heavenly Dao! The Chaotic Deities did not tolerate the Heavenly Dao and destroyed it. Today, we must kill him and avenge the Heavenly Dao and fight for it!”
 “So what if they’re the Chaotic Deities!”
 “The era of chaos has long passed. The power of the Primordial Chaos is unstoppable!”
 “Kill with me!”
 The five-clawed golden dragon roared angrily and flew away. It was extremely fast and swept past Han Jue in the blink of an eye.
 What a domineering aura!
 Han Jue felt that Qin Ling had already surpassed the Great Dao Sage Realm. Even the five-clawed golden dragon under his feet was extremely powerful.
 In the boundless light, the huge head suddenly opened its eyes. A pair of huge eyes appeared, and their pupils were filled with the image of Taiji.
 “Hmph, a mere Heavenly Dao dares to destroy the Chaos? Pangu couldn’t do it back then, let alone you!” A cold snort sounded. Even Han Jue couldn’t help but feel a little dizzy when he heard it, let alone the Heavenly Dao experts behind him. They all swayed and stopped.
  Qin Ling stepped on the five-clawed golden dragon and swung his halberd. A black spatial crack appeared with his halberd and quickly expanded, colliding with the Chaotic Deity with unstoppable force.
 The eyes of the Chaotic Deity suddenly transformed into two huge vortexes that absorbed the black crack.
 He could even absorb space!
 Qin Ling waved his halberd again. His muscles tensed up. Just by looking at his figure, one could feel the explosive power.
 Boom
 The entire void shattered and was replaced by a purple space. Boundless purple mist surged in and drowned the Chaotic Deity. “Wake up!”
 A voice came from behind Han Jue. He turned around and saw that the Heavenly Dao experts who had fallen head over heels for him had all woken up.


 The future Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity was so terrifying?
 Qin Ling’s casual strike directly shattered the Dark Forbidden Zone. It was too exaggerated.
 Fortunately, there were still more than 20 billion years to go. Who was the last mysterious figure to appear?
 He should be on the same side as Qin Ling.
 Could it be him?
 This was because Han Jue saw many shadows behind that figure. All of them looked terrifying
  It was very likely his Grand Unity Aspect!
 In addition, Qin Ling also mentioned the Primordial Chaos.
 There was nothing wrong with the Primordial Fiendcelestial establishing the Primordial World!
 Han Jue adjusted his state of mind.
 “The future is so terrifying. I have to maintain a cultivation attitude and not relax.”
 Han Jue thought silently. He had to stand in the strongest position to be at ease.
 When he reached his strongest, he would definitely indulge himself.
 One thing was certain. Even 20 billion years later, there were still very few Great Dao Sages. There was not a single Great Dao Sage among the Heavenly Dao experts who followed Qin Ling. There was only one Freedom Sage and less than twenty Heavenly Dao Sages.
 Of course, there was another possibility. That was that the Chaotic Deities had destroyed the Heavenly Dao and killed all its Great Dao Sages.
 The next Boss, Chaotic Deities!
 Buzhou Divine Mountain.
 At the top of the mountain, in front of a Daoist temple, Qin Ling, who was dressed in white, sat by the cliff and absorbed the Connate Qi of Heaven and Earth.
 Han Yu walked out of the Daoist temple and came to his side.
 Qin Ling opened his eyes and looked up at him. “Grandmaster.”
 He was very respectful to Han Yu.
 After so many years, he already treated him like family.
 Usually, his master, Tian Yong, did not care about him at all. It was his Grandmaster who taught him cultivation.
 Hearing this, Qin Ling stood up and clenched his fists. He said excitedly, “I’m willing! Grandmaster! When are we leaving?”
 He was already tired of meditating and cultivating every day. He had always wanted to spar with others, but the living beings of Buzhou Divine Mountain were all quiet cultivators. His grandmaster did not allow him to cause trouble.
 Han Yu smiled. “There’s no hurry. I’ll teach you some Mystical Powers first.”
 Qin Ling nodded excitedly.
 This was the era of prodigies.
 The geniuses were all high-spirited and arrogant. They were waiting for such a huge opportunity!
 Perhaps this Ten Thousand Dynasty Pilgrimage Ceremony was not the number one in the Heavenly Dao, but it would still allow the geniuses who stood out to be closer to it.
 For a time, the Immortal World changed.
 Boom!
 Lightning interweaved. In the endless darkness, red mist surged.
 Pan Xin knelt on an altar. There were huge pillars on all four sides. On the pillars were carved sinister and strange figures of fiendcelestials.
 In front of him stood a huge purple crystal, quietly spinning and floating.
 “So, you can’t control the Heavenly Dao?”
 A vast voice sounded.
 He was stronger than the Sages, but he couldn’t kill them in the Heavenly Dao. This made the Heavenly Dao Sages not afraid of him at all.
 What made him most depressed was that these Sages rarely left the Heavenly Dao, as if they were deliberately guarding against him.
 “Alright!” Pan Xin replied.
 He rolled his eyes and said carefully, “I want to attain the Great Dao, but relying on the inheritance of the Giant God Pangu is not enough.”
 He was not stupid. Since he couldn’t defeat a Sage in scheming, he would think of a way to increase the difference in cultivation.
 Now, he was already at the perfected Freedom Primordial Chaos Realm, but he had no clue how to attain the Great Dao. There were no related records in Pangu’s inheritance.
 The ancient voice replied, “Your foundation is not enough. Wait for now. Strengthen your Heavenly Dao providence first.”
 Pan Xin frowned and could only give up.
 The ancient voice said, “Don’t be restricted by the existing concepts. The Chaotic Fiendcelestials were only born from the Chaos. As time passed, the era moved even more. There will definitely be new potential that surpasses the past. Otherwise, how can the chaos continue? When Pangu appeared, the Chaotic Deities also didn’t think highly of him.
 “The potential of any living being born can’t be guessed. Not to mention the Chaos, even living beings born from the Heavenly Dao can have extraordinary potential, such as me and Han Jue.”
 Pan Xin pondered.
 A beam of light shot out from the purple crystal and entered the space between Pan Xin’s eyebrows.
 Pan Xin stood up, bowed, and left.
 The altar returned to silence. The flashing lightning continued.
 In the Myriad Worlds Projection, in a virtual space, the personal disciples of the Hidden Sect sat around a long table and discussed intensely.
 Xing Hongxuan suddenly appeared. She found a seat and sat down.
 After cultivating in seclusion for a long time, she needed to relax, so she wanted to understand the situation in the Immortal World.
 Xing Hongxuan heard them talking about the Ten Thousand Dynasty Pilgrimage Ceremony and mentioned the names of many geniuses.
 For example, Dugu Xing, Xuanyuan Che, Qin Ling, Hua Yin, Zhao Zheng, and so on.
 She couldn’t help but touch her abdomen as her eyes filled with anticipation.
 When the Black Hell Chicken saw Xing Hongxuan appear, it suddenly smiled and said, “What do you think our little master’s potential will be after he’s born?”
  Everyone looked at her.
 Xing Hongxuan was Han Jue’s publicly acknowledged Dao Companion, so the disciples naturally didn’t dare to joke.
 Li Daokong muttered, “Number one in the world.”
 The other disciples agreed.
 Xing Hongxuan shook her head and smiled. “What’s the use of having good potential? Don’t you know your master? After this kid is born, he will definitely be locked up in the Hundred Peak Immortal River and can’t go out.”
 She did not deny Li Daokong’s words.
 She knew her child’s potential the best because, with his help, her cultivation level increased much faster than before. It could even be described as soaring.


 They did not blame him. If not for Han Jue’s domineering rules, many of them would have died outside.
 It was precisely because of long-term cultivation that they could have their current cultivation level.
 They didn’t dare to talk too much about Han Jue and the topic quickly changed.
 Li Xuan’ao clicked his tongue in wonder. “Qin Ling’s potential is stunning in the entire Immortal World. His cultivation level is at the Immortal Emperor Realm and he can already reach the Deity Realm. Furthermore, he can suppress everyone forcefully. Senior, your judgment is as good as ever.”
 Li Daokong smiled. “It’s alright. The one teaching Qin Ling is mainly my disciple. It has nothing to do with me.”
 Zhou Fan suddenly appeared and asked curiously, “Your disciple also has Master’s bloodline, right?”
  Han Tuo’s existence was no longer a secret. Especially when the personal disciples who went out saw Han Yu, they were shocked. This matter could not be hidden anymore. Xing Hongxuan also said that she knew about this, so the disciples had no scruples. Li Daokong nodded.
 The other personal disciples discussed Han Yu and Han Tuo.
 Xun Chang’an smiled. “No matter what, Qin Ling is also a disciple of our Hidden Sect. In the future, you should take care of the people outside. Prodigies are very easy to target. Don’t let him die young.”
 Li Daokong nodded, indicating that he hoped so.
 He was a Sage and only had one disciple. There were many things that he could not interfere in and could only rely on the power of the Hidden Sect.
 The exchange in the Myriad Worlds Projection was only the shadow of a great era, but from this, it could be seen how successful the Human Race’s pilgrimage was!
 More than a hundred geniuses appeared in a grand ceremony. Every one of them had a reputation that was known by at least billions of living beings. Ten thousand dynasties came from different regions. The humans and living beings of the various regions were naturally most concerned about the geniuses who represented their regions. Therefore, even if they were ranked in the dozens, they would still be the pride of a region.
 In a region, there were not only ten billion living beings, but trillions!
 Qin Ling was also famous in the world, but because his cultivation level was too low, he couldn’t overshadow the other geniuses. He was still far from being the number one in the world.
 After the end of the pilgrimage, the Immortal World was in turmoil. Many geniuses were attacked and killed. The conflict between the dynasties became more and more intense, but it was generally peaceful.
 In the eyes of the Sages, it was considered peaceful as long as there was no domain-level war.
 The Immortal World was so big. It was impossible for there to be no conflict.
 At noon on this day.
 Han Jue slowly opened his eyes. His eyes opening meant that another five thousand years had passed. To the living beings of the Immortal World, it might be a lifetime, but to mortals, it was a hundred lifetimes.
 He was already very close to the Great Dao Realm.
 He was only a step away. He did not check his emails or observe the Immortal World. Instead, he recalled his Great Dao of Extreme Origin.
 The Great Dao Realm was the Transcendent Realm. Han Jue didn’t need to accumulate cultivation anymore. He only needed his soul to break through the door of the Great Dao.
 Unknowingly, he felt a mysterious force pressing against the door of the Great Dao, preventing him from pushing it open.
 Han Jue didn’t believe it. He wanted to forcefully attain the Dao with the Great Dao of Extreme Origin!
 It was just a stupid door!
 Why couldn’t he break through?!
 Han Jue focused and mobilized the power of the Great Dao of Extreme Origin. His soul jumped into a mysterious void. Figures appeared in front of him, all facing the door of the Great Dao.
 The door of the Great Dao stood in the void. It was ten thousand feet tall and majestic. It seemed to represent the other side. It was terrifying
 Han Jue walked past the other Dao Pursuers and suddenly discovered a familiar figure.
 Pan Xin!
  This fellow had also begun to pursue the Great Dao?
 Unfortunately, he was still far from the door of the Great Dao.
 Han Jue continued forward and soon arrived at the door.
 The door of the Great Dao seemed to be made of white rock. Its surface was engraved with various patterns that recorded the deeds of the various races of the Chaos, including the humans.
 Han Jue saw many myths.
 Pangu splitting open the heavens, Nüwa mending the sky, Gonggong angrily crashing into the Buzhou Mountain, Jingwei filling the sea, Hou Yi shooting the sun, and so on. These were all myths and legends that Han Jue had been influenced by in his previous life. They only occupied a small corner of the Great Dao Door. There was a figure at the top of the Great Dao Door. His figure was strange and extremely distorted. He was meditating and had dozens of arms. Every palm held a mysterious item that even Han Jue couldn’t see clearly.
 That was probably a Chaotic Deity!
 Han Jue retracted his gaze and looked at the Great Dao Door again.
 The door of the Great Dao looked as firm as a rock and could not be pushed open.
 Han Jue condensed the Great Dao of Extreme Origin. A huge black shadow slowly emerged from his body and quickly condensed into his figure. Then, he quickly became burly, like those ancient fiendcelestials carved on the door of the Great Dao.
 The Great Dao of Extreme Origin roared angrily and pressed his palms against the door of the Great Dao.
 It began to push the Great Dao Gate with all its might.
 Han Jue showed a frown.
 Something was indeed wrong!
 Something was obstructing him!
 Han Jue immediately used the Dharma Idol Fusion Technique and fused the Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial, the Strength Fiendcelestial, the Battle Fiendcelestial, and the other Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols with domineering power into the Great Dao of Extreme Origin.
 At first glance, it was as if shadows emerged from Han Jue’s back and entered the huge black shadow formed by the Great Dao of Extreme Origin. Every time a Fiendcelestial power entered, the black shadow of the Great Dao of Extreme Origin would increase by ten thousand feet.
 Boom!
 The door of the Great Dao began to shake violently. It was enough to show how terrifying Han Jue’s strength was.
 The entire Immortal World was in front of Han Jue. He could easily crush it into dust with a finger.
 “How dare you?!”
 A shout suddenly sounded, causing Han Jue’s soul to tremble. He suddenly looked up and saw black mist surging above the door of the Great Dao. It was like a huge beast crawling on the door of the Great Dao and looking down at him.
 Han Jue saw a pair of cold eyes.
 He had seen many such eyes before. They were all filled with contempt for ants!
 Han Jue said, “Why are you stopping me?”
 The black mist said in a low voice, “How can a mortal enter the door of the Great Dao!”
 Han Jue didn’t believe it and continued to make the Great Dao of Extreme Origin push.
  The door opened a small crack. A violent wind roared out, but it could not shake the Great Dao of Extreme Origin.
 Han Jue secretly heaved a sigh of relief. It seemed that the mysterious black mist couldn’t stop him with all its might and could only use some small methods.
 “Without the recognition of the Chaotic Deities, you are not allowed to step into the Great Dao! Mortal, you are courting death!” the black mist said angrily, its voice even louder than before.
 Han Jue asked, “Then, how do I obtain the recognition of the Chaotic Deities?”
 “Kneel down and swear to the Great Dao that you will forever be loyal to the Chaotic Deities and the Chaos!”
 Han Jue smiled.
 So this was the trap!
 No wonder the Dao Ancestor wanted to disappear. It seemed that he was restrained by the Chaotic Deities.


 A line of words appeared in front of him.
 (Detected that you are threatened by a Great Dao Divine Spirit. You have the following choices:)
 [2: Push open the door to the Great Dao. You should cut through all obstacles and risk your life on the path to the Dao. You can obtain a Great Dao fragment and a Creation Spirit Stone.]
 A choice that had not appeared for a long time!
 Ever since Han Jue attained the Dao, such choices were almost extinct.
  This time, the system was clearly biased towards option 1.
 Han Jue felt that the system was going against him. It always used more rewards to lure him on the path he didn’t want to take.
 He directly chose the second option.
 (You chose to open the door to the Great Dao and obtained a Great Dao fragment and a Creation Spirit Stone.)
 At this point, Han Jue gathered nine Great Dao fragments.
 He continued to control the Great Dao of Extreme Origin to push the door of the Great Dao.
 At this point, he couldn’t lower his head!
 Han Jue could only take a gamble now.
 He bet that after he attained the Great Dao, the Dao Field could be upgraded!
 “Open for me!” Han Jue roared in his mind.
 The black mist on the Great Dao Door became even angrier and roared, “Mortal, you will pay a price you can’t afford!”
 Han Jue was not afraid of him at all.
 If it was really a Chaotic Deity, he might still feel scared.
 However, the system notification indicated that this fellow was a Great Dao Divine Spirit, an existence similar to a Great Dao Sage!
 Clearly, this fellow was using the Chaotic Deities’ name to intimidate others.
 Boom!
 The doors of the Great Dao were constantly pushed open, and the wind that whistled out was even stronger.
 The black mist dissipated.
 The Great Dao Divine Spirit knew that it was useless to talk nonsense and could only leave.
 [Despair Dao Spirit has developed hatred towards you. Current Hatred Points: 6 stars]
 Great!
 I’ll curse you when Iget back!
 A dazzling light emerged and covered Han Jue’s figure.
 At the same time, he felt a powerful suction force. The wind began to reverse and no longer blew out but in.
 He immediately stepped into the door of the Great Dao.
 Boom!
 Thunderclouds gathered in the Immortal World and the myriad worlds. Terrifying heavenly might enveloped the heavens.
 Even the 33rd Heaven was suppressed by the Heavenly Might. The Sages walked out of their Dao Fields and gathered in front of the Universal Hall.
 “What’s happening?” “What a terrifying heavenly might. Did something happen to the Heavenly Dao?”
 “Could it be that someone has attained the Dao?”
 “Previously, when we attained the Dao, there was no such phenomenon!” “Then what’s going on? The Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity has descended in advance?”
 The Sages couldn’t help but look at Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du. He knew the most.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du frowned. “I’m not sure, either. Let’s wait and see. To have such heavenly might means that the Heavenly Dao is protecting itself and warning all living beings. To be predicted by the Heavenly Dao means that it’s not a calamity.”
 His words made the Sages heave a sigh of relief.
 They were afraid that the Chaos would attack again.
 It had been tens of thousands of years since the last Heavenly Dao crisis. They could finally take a breather and cultivate in peace. They did not want to face enemies stronger than themselves.
 The Sages were so flustered, let alone all living beings. The current Immortal World was not as isolated as before. With the integration of the Calamity Race, all living beings had a better understanding of the Chaos and knew that many powerful existences hiding in the Chaos hated the Heavenly Dao.
 Because of the protection of the Dao Field, the hundreds of thousands of disciples did not feel anything special.
 In the Daoist temple, Han Jue had already begun to break through.
 Freedom transformed into the Great Dao!
 From his body, Dharmic powers, soul, to his senses, he had transformed in all aspects!
 Han Jue opened his eyes, causing golden light to burst out. The myriad worlds were reflected in his eyes.
 His vision swept towards the Chaos at an extremely fast speed.
 He saw worlds and domains that were either magnificent or sinister. He saw Dao Pursuers wandering in the Chaos.
 He saw the Evil Heavenly Emperor, Han Tuo, and Chu Shiren, as well as many enemies.
 At a glance, it was not spying.
 Han Jue was worried that he would see a transcendent existence like Chaotic Consciousness and immediately retracted his
 gaze.
 Forty-nine years later.
 (Detected that you have attained the Great Dao. You have the following choices:]
 [2: Cultivate in a low-profile manner and maintain your original intention. You can obtain a Great Dao fragment, a Heavenly Dao Spirit Stone, a Creation Spirit Stone, and a chance to upgrade the Dao Field.]
 As expected, the Dao Field could be upgraded!
 Han Jue immediately chose the second option.
 (You chose to cultivate in a low-profile manner and maintain your original intention. You obtained a Great Dao fragment, a Heavenly Dao Spirit Stone, a Creation Spirit Stone, and a chance to upgrade the Dao Field.]
 [The Dao Field has begun to upgrade.)
 Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief.
 He finally began to level up!
 Although it felt good to reject the Great Dao Divine Spirit, he would inevitably be worried later.
 As Han Jue consolidated his cultivation, he checked his attributes panel.

 Han Jue was excited.
 Soon, he restrained his emotions and continued to consolidate his cultivation.
  After breaking through, his Dharmic powers were increasing at an extremely exaggerated speed. His soul was still transforming. This feeling was extremely wonderful, even more extreme than any joy in the world.
 In the Chaotic Void, countless meteors surrounded a huge palace in the shape of a vortex. This palace had no ceiling and the ground was extremely vast.
 A figure suddenly descended into the hall.
 It was Jie Yin.
 Jie Yin bowed. A black shadow appeared on the steps in front of him like a whirlwind. It was difficult to tell its true form.
 “Exalted God, the Han Jue you’re looking for has been hiding in the Heavenly Dao and can’t be killed,” Jie Yin said respectfully.
 The black shadow said in a low voice, “This child violated the rules of the Great Dao and must be eliminated. I’ll leave this to you.”
 Jie Yin smiled helplessly. “Our sect’s Cundi and Jade Bodhi died under the hands of the Dark Forbidden Lord one after another. Han Jue is closely related to him. If you want to deal with him, it’s best to deal with the Dark Forbidden Lord first. When you deal with him, I’ll attack Han Jue.”
