 The dream was the Primordial Void, the place where Han Jue fought with the Foolish Sword Sage.
 This was also a nostalgic person.
 Han Jue sighed.
 Foolish Sword Sage said proudly, “Divine Might Heavenly Sage, my cultivation level has improved again recently. I want to spar with you, but you haven’t reached the Supreme Realm yet. I don’t want to bully you.’
 “Impossible! Absolutely impossible!”
 The Foolish Sword Sage denied.
 Han Jue said, “Actually, I still don’t know how to attain the Supreme Realm.”
 Foolish Sword Sage said, “Take your time to figure it out. Every Great Dao Sage has a different method to attain it. Others can’t teach you. Cultivation can only rely on oneself after reaching the Great Dao Supreme Realm.”
  Han Jue nodded. This was the truth.
 He looked at the Foolish Sword Sage with a strange expression.
Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎 This fellow sent him a dream to show off?
 ......
 “The leader of Life was cursed to death by the Dark Forbidden Lord. Now, the Life faction has entered seclusion,” the Foolish Sword Sage said. “Oh? That’s a good thing.”
 “However, the Dark Forbidden Lord might be from the Great Dao Divine Spirits. You have to be careful. The Dark Forbidden Lord targeted the Heavenly Dao previously. You have also killed a Great Dao Divine Spirit. You have to know that the Life Lord is also a Great Dao Supreme, but he still died tragically. Speaking of which, this Dark Forbidden Lord is terrifying. He can curse a supreme existence who saw through the illusion to death with the power of a curse.”
 The Foolish Sword Sage clicked his tongue in wonder.
 Han Jue asked curiously, “What do you mean by seeing through the illusion?”
 “A Great Dao Supreme can destroy the Chaos as long as they are given enough time!”
 Destroy the Chaos?
 So powerful?
 Han Jue frowned. “Is it that easy?”
 The Foolish Sword Sage said, “Of course, there must be a balance. In the past, I thought that the Great Dao was the strongest, but I encountered a transcendent existence not long ago. I still have a lingering fear even now.”
 Chaotic Consciousness?
 Han Jue was secretly curious.
 This Chaotic Deity was high and mighty, looking down on the entire Chaos. What was he thinking and what was he pursuing?
 The Foolish Sword Sage raised his eyebrows. “Why aren’t you asking anymore?”
 “I should ask less about an existence that can make you so afraid.” Han Jue spread his hands.
 Foolish Sword Sage was amused. “I can’t even figure you out. Are you arrogant or timid?”
 “Coward. I attacked you previously because I had no choice. Wouldn’t you kill them all if it was a mortal enemy? Aren’t you afraid of endless trouble?”
 Foolish Sword Sage nodded. He admired Han Jue even more.
 Han Jue suddenly asked, “Are we good friends?”
 The Foolish Sword Sage was stunned.
 Han Jue said, “We became friends after a fight. I’ve made very little karma in my life. I’ve interacted with you the most ever since I attained the Dao. I’m usually busy cultivating.”
 Foolish Sword Sage snorted. “I just want to regain my reputation, not befriend you.”
 [Foolish Sword Sage’s favorability towards you has increased. Current favorability: 4 stars]
 This was…
 Han Jue was speechless.
 The dream shattered.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and muttered, “This old fool needs a beating. See if I don’t beat you into submission in the future.”
 It seemed that it was impossible to duplicate the Foolish Sword Sage’s latest strength for now.
 He wasn’t at six stars of favorability, so it could spell danger!
 Han Jue shook his head and looked at the Chaos.
 Liu Bei had already left for many years and had yet to find the third Dao Field location. Han Jue would visit him when he was free. This fellow was timid and cautious. He was safe along the way.
 He was too slow.
 He had not left Han Jue’s range for so many years.
 Han Jue looked away after a while.
 In the Chaos, the Great Dao Tower stood quietly in the bright starry sky.
 A black-robed man was meditating in the palace on the first floor of the tower.
 Han Jue would definitely recognize him if he was here.
 It was an old friend of the Jade Pure Sacred Sect, Mo Fuchou!
 Zhou Fan suddenly appeared at this moment.
 Zhou Fan felt that it made sense.
 He began to look down on the realms below the Sages and ignored the actual situation after attaining the Dao.
 Mo Fuchou asked nervously, “No, you should keep it for your subordinates. Isn’t it better to nurture a loyal Sage?”
 “What are you saying? We’re brothers. I wouldn’t be here today if not for you. I have to help you attain the Dao. In the future, the two of us will continue to wander the Chaos and make a name for ourselves,” Zhou Fan said proudly.
 Mo Fuchou was touched, but he was too embarrassed to reveal his true feelings.
 “Little Fan, what’s the Heavenly Dao like now?” Mo Fuchou asked curiously.
 He had been cultivating in seclusion here ever since he arrived. Zhou Fan did not visit him often, so he knew very little about the outside world.
 Zhou Fan smiled. “The Heavenly Dao is no longer the same as before. There are already more than twenty Sages.”
 Mo Fuchou was stunned. “So many? Doesn’t that mean that Brother Han Jue has already attained the Dao?”
 Zhou Fan’s expression turned strange.
 He never said that he had already acknowledged Han Jue as his master.
 Before Mo Fuchou was revived, he was already used to this identity. However, he was a little embarrassed now. In the past, he often bragged that he would definitely surpass Han Jue…
  Now…
 The more Zhou Fan thought about it, the more depressed he became. He was originally pleased with himself and felt good pretending in front of Mo Fuchou, but he lost his confidence when Mo Fuchou mentioned it.
 He didn’t know how strong Han Jue was, but a million years ago, the latter could already easily kill a Great Dao Sage!
 With Han Jue’s talent…
 Zhou Fan shivered and did not dare to continue thinking about it.
 “Cough cough, he has naturally attained the Dao long ago,” Zhou Fan said ambiguously.
 Mo Fuchou looked nostalgic. “Speaking of which, the two of us don’t have many old friends. And I’m afraid only Brother Han Jue has the potential to live for more than two million years. Let’s go back to the Heavenly Dao and meet him if there’s a chance in the future.”
 Zhou Fan’s expression was unnatural. “He has already attained the Dao. He shouldn’t think highly of us. Why should we see him?”
 “Nonsense. Brother Han Jue was already far stronger than us when we met in the past. Have you ever seen him put on airs? I believe Brother Han Jue doesn’t have many old friends with his personality. He should be happy to meet us,” Mo Fuchou shook his head and said. He smiled as he remembered his time in the Jade Pure Sacred Sect.


 Zhou Fan could not win against Mo Fuchou. In the end, he said helplessly, “I’ll bring you back to the Heavenly Dao after you attain the Dao.”
 “Alright!”
 Mo Fuchou smiled and looked forward to seeing Han Jue.
 He suddenly thought of Mo Zhu and the Mo family.
 It had been more than two million years.
 They had probably fallen into the cycle of reincarnation long ago.
 Mo Fuchou sighed upon thinking of this.
 Zhou Fan was afraid that Mo Fuchou would mention Han Jue again, so he immediately changed the topic and talked about the recent interesting things in the Chaos.
 Mo Fuchou was quickly intrigued and began to listen with relish.
  Zhou Fan heaved a sigh of relief. As he spoke, he began to posture and talk about the Great Dao Tower’s deeds.
 Myriad Worlds Projection.
 Dao Sovereign, Zhao Xuanyuan, and Jiang Yi appeared at the same time.
 ......
 The Black Hell Chicken shouted, “Have the three of you been beaten up again?”
 Zhao Xuanyuan glared at him and cursed, “What do you mean by that! We’re fighting! Recently, our cultivation levels have increased again!”
 Jiang Yi said proudly, “Sorry, I’m already a Freedom Sage!”
 With that said, the others in the space gathered. “Really?”
 “What about Dao Sovereign and Zhao Xuanyuan? They also attained the Freedom Realm?”
 “Amazing, he’s even faster than Li Daokong!”
 “Of course. The three of us still have to carry the sect’s burden.”
 “Hehe, I’ll catch up soon!”
 Everyone spoke at once, and the atmosphere was lively.
 Zhou Fan appeared and quickly disappeared when he heard their conversation.
 Guan Bubai smiled. “Someone is agitated.”
 Dao Sovereign said, “Zhou Fan will probably be here soon. He has been walking in front.”
 In the past, Zhou Fan had been the most pretentious, causing the other disciples to grit their teeth in hatred. Of course, they were only playing. After all, they were all from the same sect. They would definitely support each other if they really encountered trouble.
 Everyone smiled and did not continue to mock him.
 Zhao Xuanyuan asked, “Where’s Chu Shiren? Isn’t he here?”
 Dao Sovereign and the other two frowned.
 Guan Bubai came in front of Jiang Yi and said, “Let’s spar in the simulation trial. I want to taste the power of the Freedom Sage.”
 Jiang Yi smiled. He wanted to show off!
 Time flew.
 He deliberately woke up after fifty thousand years.
 ex
 The stars in the Primordial World already far exceeded those of the past. Compared to the Heavenly Dao, the energy contained in the stars was unparalleled.
 Now, Han Jue’s Dharmic powers had already habitually surged into the stars and automatically tempered them. This was a good sign.
 Han Jue checked the emails.
 Soon, he saw an intriguing email.
 (Your good friend Foolish Sword Sage was attacked by your enemy Pangu.]
 Not bad. He was not severely injured this
 time.
 It seemed that things were indeed different
 now.
 Han Jue was also very curious about Pangu. His injuries should have recovered after so long. Could it be that he was afraid of the Dark Forbidden Lord?
 No, that was Pangu.
 He was probably waiting for instructions.
 That was good.
  Han Jue only wanted to attain the Great Dao Supreme Realm as soon as possible. The calmer the Chaos, the better. He could show off when he broke through and a storm appeared.
 Han Jue continued reading and didn’t see any other emails that interested him.
 After reading the emails, Han Jue suddenly thought of Jiang Jueshi.
 Jiang Jueshi’s favorability towards him had not decreased after so many years.
 Han Jue hesitated for a moment and decided to visit him in his dreams.
 This time, he turned the dream into an illusion.
 He appeared as an old man in front of him.
 Jiang Jueshi opened his eyes and was stunned when he saw Han Jue.
 “Master…” Jiang Jueshi muttered to himself. His emotions surged, but he controlled them very well and did not let them erupt.
 Han Jue said, “Disciple, how have you been?”
 Jiang Jueshi suddenly woke up. Where was this?
 He could not sense it, but he couldn’t sense his body either.
 It was not reality. Could it be an illusion?
 Perhaps I miss Master too much…
 Jiang Jueshi felt relieved when he thought it through. In that case, it was better to reminisce with his imaginary master.
 Jiang Jueshi said, “Not bad, Master. All these years…”
 He began to talk about his past.
 Han Jue listened patiently.
 After a long time, Jiang Jueshi finished talking about his experience. Just like Han Jue knew, he was still imprisoned by Ancestor Xitian and was cultivating in peace.
 Han Jue said, “It’s been hard on you. You still have to be vigilant after leaving the Heavenly Dao. You have to know that there’s always someone stronger. Sages are only the peak of the Heavenly Dao.”
 Jiang Jueshi smiled bitterly. “I was indeed reckless.”
 Han Jue said, “Master will always look at you. I believe you. I’ll teach you a Mystical Power. You can use this Mystical Power if you can’t hold on and face death.”
 Jiang Jueshi was silent.
 Han Jue immediately taught him the Invocation Technique.
 Then, he instructed, “Remember, don’t use it rashly unless it’s a critical moment.”
 Jiang Jueshi nodded.
 The dream shattered.
 Jiang Jueshi suddenly woke up. He was still sitting on the mountain peak.
 He sighed slightly.
 Jiang Jueshi stopped thinking and continued cultivating.
 Although this place was good, it made him uneasy. He had to hold his life in his hands.
 Inside the Daoist temple.
 Xing Hongxuan opened her eyes and touched her abdomen.
 She frowned slightly.
 She could feel the fetus moving in recent years.
 Being able to move meant that it had developed intelligence.
 She began to hesitate. Although it was good to use her son as a cultivation aid, she had never given birth to him. She had mistreated him too much.
 Should she force him out?
 Xing Hongxuan had a bold thought.
 However, she thought of her dream and what her future self had said.
  She stood up and walked out of the Daoist temple to visit Han Jue.
 Han Jue was still observing the Heavenly Dao and happened to be free, so he let her in.
 “Premature birth? No, this child has to be born normally. Otherwise, he will die,” Han Jue said seriously.
 Xing Hongxuan asked curiously, “Why? Is there a restriction?”
 Han Jue felt awkward and didn’t know how to reply.
 Xing Hongxuan said worriedly, “Recently, he’s been moving more and more, as if begging me to let him be born earlier.”
 Han Jue frowned and looked at her abdomen.
 He could see that the fetus was indeed moving. It already had intelligence, but it was very weak and could not think independently for the time being
 Han Jue had to temporarily seal his bloodline if he wanted to be born.
 “Sit beside me,” Han Jue called out softly.


 Han Jue’s Sage Sense entered the fetus’ body, wanting to seal its Primordial Fiendcelestial bloodline.
 Boom
 Han Jue trembled and his eyes narrowed.
 Backlash!
 A powerful force erupted from the fetus, resisting his Sage Sense.
 “This kid…”
 Han Jue was triggered.
 Han Jue’s eyes narrowed and he continued to try.
  Xing Hongxuan frowned. Her stomach hurt, but she was a Sage, after all. She was not afraid of pain.
 The fetus was still resisting Han Jue’s Sage Sense. Thus, he had no choice but to use his Dharmic powers.
 After a long while…
 ......
 Han Jue stopped and said, “His bloodline is not simple. I’ll seal it if you really want him to be born. However, he won’t be a genius after he’s born.”
 Xing Hongxuan frowned. “Must you seal it?”
 Han Jue said, “Definitely. Otherwise, it will attract a calamity. You can’t mention this to anyone, including him.”
 Xing Hongxuan was silent.
 She had long guessed that this child was extraordinary
 “Then, let’s wait a little longer. Perhaps I’m thinking too much. He’s not meant to be born yet,” Xing Hongxuan said in a low voice.
 Han Jue nodded and secretly sealed his son’s intelligence, lest it grew into an old demon before he was born.
 Xing Hongxuan stood up and left.
 After she left, Han Jue thought silently, “Will my son never be born normally if I remain as the Primordial Fiendcelestial?”
 (Ten billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 (Yes]
 Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief.
 Then, I’ll nurture it for another eight million
 years!
 He would wait until he gathered the Primordial Chaos Great Creation.
 A hundred thousand years later, Han Jue’s Dharmic powers had already increased several times. The 10.8 decillion stars transformed again.
 Han Jue was very satisfied with this cultivation success. Although he didn’t know how long it would take for him to break through, there was at least hope.
 There were very few Great Dao Supremes in the Chaos. Even most Great Dao Sages did not know of the existence of this realm. One had to know that the number of Great Dao Sages was scant.
 The reason why he stopped was that an aura appeared outside the Heavenly Dao.
 Chaotic Fiendcelestial, Red Fate.
 She had been waiting for more than two thousand years.
 Han Jue created a clone and asked it to find Red Fate.
 In the Dark Forbidden Zone, Red Fate was meditating and cultivating.
 She opened her eyes and smiled when she saw Han Jue flying over.
 “Why are you visiting again?” he asked.
 He had deliberately left Red Fate hanging for more than two thousand years. He did not expect this woman to not leave.
 Red Fate said, “What’s the matter? Fellow Daoist Han, why are you so wary of me? I didn’t attack the Heavenly Dao or scheme against you.”
 Han Jue remained silent.
 Red Fate said, “Forget it, let’s get down to business. A group of terrifying existences called the Divine Authority Generals appeared in the depths of the Chaos. They seem to be searching for something. A Chaotic Fiendcelestial resisted them and was directly killed. His body and soul were destroyed.”
 So domineering?
 Han Jue raised his eyebrows.
 Could it be that the Divine Authority Generals wanted to use the name of the inspector to purge the Chaos?
 Red Fate said, “I went to ask the Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial and discovered that he was no longer in the Grand Primordium Domain. He’s missing. Not only that, but even his subordinates are gone.”
 Han Jue showed a frown.
 Red Fate sighed. “This old fellow definitely knew something in advance and went to hide somewhere. I came to find you this time to discuss how to face the Divine Authority Generals.”
 “Do you know their strength and numbers?” Han Jue asked.
 Red Fate said, “The cultivation of a Great Dao Sage, and a top Great Dao Sage at that. There are nearly ten thousand of them. This power is almost invincible. We either give up resisting or die if we face them alone.”
 Han Jue asked, “Can we survive by giving up resisting?”
 Red Fate said, “The Chaotic lifeforms can survive, but only one Chaotic Fiendcelestial has encountered a Divine Authority General and died. In addition, the Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial has disappeared. I’m worried…
 “Besides, Pangu has disappeared for a long time. Don’t you find it strange?
 “I suspect that a mysterious existence is secretly plotting against the Chaotic Fiendcelestials, wanting to eliminate us all.”
 Han Jue frowned even more. He was enlightened.
 That was really possible!
 The Chaotic Consciousness definitely knew that the Chaotic Fiendcelestials could evolve into a Primordial Fiendcelestial. Pangu had tried it back then.
 He had to eliminate all possibilities if he couldn’t find the Primordial Fiendcelestial.
 The threat would be too great if the Great Dao Supremes and Great Dao Sages transformed into Primordial Fiendcelestials!
 Han Jue asked, “Does the Foolish Sword Sage have a chance of winning against a Divine Authority General alone before attaining the Great Dao Supreme Realm?”
 Red Fate asked curiously, “What is the Great Dao Supreme? The realm above the Great Dao
 Sage?”
 Han Jue hesitated for a moment and nodded.
 Red Fate was deep in thought.
 Han Jue coughed and interrupted her thoughts.
 “Of course. The Foolish Sword Sage is definitely a top-notch existence among the Great Dao Sages. According to what I know, that Chaotic Fiendcelestial whose body and soul was destroyed first fought two Divine Authority Generals before being swarmed and cruelly killed.”
 He wished that more Chaotic Fiendcelestials would die.
 After all, the Chaotic Fiendcelestials also hated the Primordial Fiendcelestial.
 So this was her objective!
 Han Jue snorted in his heart.
 He shook his head and said, “It’s just a special restriction. The Dao Field will still be in the Heavenly Dao if we really encounter a Divine Authority General. We won’t be able to hide.”
 Red Fate frowned.
 Han Jue said, “Moreover, you have to submit to me if you want to enter my Dao Field. I’ll use some methods on you, else I’ll be worried.”
 Red Fate frowned even more.
 “Go back and consider it. Think about it before looking for me,” Han Jue said and left.
  Red Fate stayed for a while before leaving.
 Inside the Daoist temple.
 Han Jue thought, “I want to see the process of the Divine Authority Generals killing the Chaotic Fiendcelestial that Red Fate mentioned!”
 (1 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 How expensive!
 Continue!
 Han Jue entered the illusion.
 He opened his eyes and discovered that he had appeared in a void. Dark lights were distributed parallel to the void. In front of him was a huge skeleton covered in countless stars.
 Han Jue sensed something and turned around. He saw a strong light appear in the darkness behind him and sweep over.
 He narrowed his eyes as he saw mighty figures in the strong light. They were even taller than Buzhou Divine Mountain. They walked side by side, and their figures were like armor. They were domineering and powerful.


 Han Jue frowned as he looked at the ten thousand Divine Authority Generals from afar.
 However, the Divine Authority Generals had the pressure of a god. It was indescribable.
 Ten thousand Divine Authority Generals advanced side by side. Every figure was taller than Buzhou Divine Mountain. Ten thousand Buzhou Divine Mountain crushed forward side by side. How majestic was that? It was unstoppable!
 The huge skeleton trembled slightly, and the countless stars on its body flickered.
 “Why are you here?”
 A deep shout resounded through the void.
 The ten thousand Divine Authority Generals didn’t answer and continued forward. Soon, they passed through Han Jue and stepped on the huge skeleton.
 Han Jue felt a strong heat the moment their bodies crossed.
  The Divine Authority Generals did not seem to be living beings. They were more like condensed Dharmic powers, but at a higher level.
 The huge skeleton trembled as the Divine Authority Generals approached. It actually raised a hand and slapped it at them. This hand was so huge that it tore through the void and struck with endless spatial lightning. The two Divine Authority Generals flew out and waved their halberds. Two terrifying divine powers gathered and shattered the bones in the huge hand.
 The countless stars on the huge skeleton emitted a strong light and quickly condensed into a strong figure. It was the Chaotic Fiendcelestial.
 ......
 The Chaotic Fiendcelestial condensed another arm and raised them. The strong light on its body gathered above its palm. A vortex of light burst forth and quickly expanded, sweeping through the entire void.
 A terrifying suction force burst out from the light vortex. It could even tear space apart. Han Jue vaguely saw a bloody mouth inside. It was indescribably sinister and terrifying. Ten thousand Divine Authority Generals suddenly swarmed up!
 This scene was extremely shocking!
 Ten thousand mighty figures taller than Buzhou Divine Mountain rushed towards the Chaotic Fiendcelestial.
 The divine light on their bodies condensed together like a halberd that split through the Chaos and directly shattered the light vortex.
 “Trouble of the Chaos, die!” a dignified shout shook the void. Even Han Jue’s Dao heart jumped. Immediately after, a strong light burst out and drowned his vision.
 The illusion shattered.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and recalled the battle pressure.
 I knew it!
 “I want to know how long until the Divine Authority Generals monitor the Heavenly Dao?” Han Jue asked in his mind.
 (1 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 (Three million years.]
 Han Jue showed a frown.
 It was a little urgent.
 Ten thousand Divine Authority Generals were attacking. The Heavenly Dao would definitely be affected if they attacked the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 Han Jue wanted to destroy them.
 He could just hide in the Dao Field even if the Chaotic Consciousness personally attacked.
 Before that, he had to increase his cultivation as much as possible.
 Currently, facing ten thousand Divine Authority Generals was unstable. He couldn’t kill them instantly.
 Han Jue stopped thinking and continued to refine the stars in the Primordial World.
 In a mysterious space.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor knelt in front of a majestic figure that emitted divine light. He was very respectful and did not dare to look
 up.
 “The Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity has already begun, but it’s not time for great chaos.”
 An illusory voice sounded.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor asked in a low voice, “May I ask how we ordinary living beings should transcend the tribulation when the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity begins and the Chaotic Fiendcelestials and Great Dao Divine Spirits wreak havoc?”
 The illusory voice sounded again, “Hard to
  say.”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor’s heart sank.
 Even this unknown existence could not give him a chance of survival?
 “The game has begun. All living beings are pawns. The Primordial Fiendcelestial’s existence is no longer important.”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor was stunned.
Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates The Primordial Fiendcelestial was no longer important?
 He suddenly thought of Pangu, Life, and the Chaotic Fiendcelestial. He was terrified.
 “Could it be that the Primordial Fiendcelestial is not the key to the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity?” The Evil Heavenly Emperor asked.
 “It’s the Chaotic Era now. The Primordial Fiendcelestial can’t shake the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority of the Chaos no matter how strong it is. Evil Heavenly Emperor, you should make a choice. In the Chaotic Era, you will be doomed once you stand on the wrong side.”
 “Can I choose you?”
 “I’ve long stopped entering the calamity. The battle of all things is meaningless to me. I’ll still exist even if the Chaos is destroyed. You can leave.”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor was silent.
 After a long while…
 He stood up, bowed, and left.
 After ten steps, the Evil Heavenly Emperor suddenly stopped and asked, “Has my fate changed?”
 “The fate of the Great Dao cannot be spied on, nor is it fixed. It only decides the overall situation. You are facing the opportunity to change your fate now.”
 Hearing this, the Evil Heavenly Emperor immediately advanced without hesitation and quickly disappeared.
 All living beings lived their lives in decades. Immortals spent years cultivating, while Sages lived for ten thousand years in one go.
 A hundred thousand years passed quickly.
 Han Jue opened his eyes. Billions of stars seemed to be hidden in his eyes.
 His cultivation level increased again. As the recent transformation of the stars succeeded, 10.8 decillion stars actually began to produce a large amount of nebulous Primordial Qi. The entire Primordial World was in a hazy purple mist, as if everything was murky before the creation of the world.
 Although there were still no signs of a breakthrough, there was at least hope!
 Han Jue used the simulation trial to detect the vicinity of the Heavenly Dao and confirmed that other than Red Fate, there were no other powerful enemies.
 Red Fate had been waiting outside the Heavenly Dao for thousands of years and had probably made a decision.
 “Will it be dangerous if I go out and capture Red Fate now?” Han Jue asked in his mind. What if Red Fate was a pawn and the Chaotic Consciousness was spying on everything?
 (200 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [No]
 Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief and stood up. He activated all his Supreme Treasures as if his divinity had been stimulated and he was in a dazzling divine light.
 He jumped in front of Red Fate.
 Red Fate opened her eyes and looked at him. “Another Chaotic Fiendcelestial was destroyed tens of thousands of years ago.”
 Her tone was filled with fear.
 Han Jue said, “Then, what’s your decision?”
 “I’ll submit to you! I can withstand whatever you have!” Red Fate said seriously.
  She suddenly smiled and said, “Of course, I want to be your Dao Companion more.”
 Han Jue suddenly struck out with his palm. The Great Change Sealing Palm struck her.
 Red Fate was sealed before she could react.
 Han Jue brought her back to the Daoist temple and threw her into the Primordial Heavenly Prison.
 Red Fate widened her beautiful eyes and stared at him.
 “Wait for a while. Don’t worry, I won’t hurt you,” Han Jue said casually. Red Fate was relieved.
 She was secretly shocked. She knew that Han Jue was strong, but she didn’t expect him to be this strong
 She actually didn’t have time to react.
 Furthermore, what sealing technique was this?
 Too ridiculous!


 Red Fate was a Great Dao Sage, after all. He couldn’t enslave her successfully in a short period of time. Although Red Fate was calm, Han Jue didn’t dare to let his guard down and kept her sealed.
 Han Jue began to check his emails with relish.
 After a long time.
 Red Fate couldn’t help but ask, “Fellow Daoist Han, where do you think the Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial is hiding? During this period of time, I investigated the Divine Authority Generals and discovered that they have appeared a long time ago. They had truly swept through the Chaos. There’s nowhere to hide.”
 Han Jue said, “I’m not sure, either. Perhaps the Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial is just arrogant?”
 Red Fate nodded and sighed. “Back then, Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial was so high-spirited when he proposed that the Fiendcelestials join forces. I didn’t expect him to be frightened by the Divine Authority Generals and escape. He didn’t even dare to inform the other Fiendcelestials.”
 The Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial was one of the strongest Chaotic Fiendcelestials, after all. It was actually so cowardly. It was obvious how terrifying the Divine Authority Generals were.
 Han Jue said, “Indeed.”
 No matter what, he should inform the other Chaotic Fiendcelestials and be prepared together. After all, they had faced Pangu together before and were considered friends of life and death.
  Han Jue’s evaluation of the Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial was much lower.
 This fellow was just born early!
 “That’s right. But then again, Fellow Daoist Han, can your Dao Field block the Divine Authority Generals?” Red Fate asked.
 ......
 Han Jue said, “Yes. Since we’re family, I won’t hide it from you. We can block it, but only. We can only stay here forever if the Divine Authority Generals camp outside.”
 Red Fate smiled. “That’s fine. I can cultivate now.”
 She hesitated for a moment and asked, “I have a world under me…”
 Han Jue interrupted, “We’ll talk about it later!”
 He had to successfully enslave her first!
 It was not difficult to open a space in the Hundred Peak Immortal River and hide a world.
 Han Jue had thought of protecting the Heavenly Dao like this before, but this would cut off the Chaotic Heavenly Road. He was still worried that the Dao Ancestor and Pangu would use the Heavenly Dao to enter the Dao Field. It was too dangerous.
 But it would be a different story if it was just a world.
 Red Fate didn’t say anything else and only stared at him quietly.
 After reading the emails, Han Jue began to observe the Immortal World and the myriad worlds.
 Several days later, he began cultivating.
 Red Fate was shocked by his aura as he cultivated the stars.
 “What realm is he at? Could it be the Supreme Realm he mentioned before?”
 Red Fate thought silently. She was not nervous about her future. No matter what, it was better than being killed by the Divine Authority Generals.
 In the dark sky, rain poured down and mist rose in the world.
 Beside a huge lake was a small pavilion. Four people were fishing beside the pavilion.
 They were Lao Dan, Dao Sovereign, Zhao Xuanyuan, and Jiang Yi.
 Dao Sovereign looked at Lao Dan and said, “Senior, tell me.”
 Lao Dan snorted. “Actually, it’s not an exaggeration. To be precise, they’re even more powerful than the Great Dao Sages. In a one-on-one battle, the Divine Authority Generals are also top-notch existences among the Great Dao Sages. The Divine Authority Generals are not living beings, but the Supreme Rule of the Chaos. They will appear every time the source of chaos appears. This is also the reason why the Chaos can exist forever.
 “The appearance of the Divine Authority Generals this time is probably to search for the Primordial Fiendcelestial.”
 Jiang Yi asked curiously, “No matter how strong the Primordial Fiendcelestial is, it’s not a match for ten thousand Great Dao Sages, right? In that case, the Primordial Fiendcelestial can’t threaten the Chaos. Then, why do they say that the Primordial Fiendcelestial will stir up the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity?”
 Lao Dan frowned. “Actually, I’m also puzzled. Thinking about it carefully, I don’t know who said that the Primordial Fiendcelestial will stir up the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity. Furthermore, I don’t know how powerful the Primordial Fiendcelestial is. From the previous Primordial Pill, the Primordial Fiendcelestial is indeed powerful, but it’s not so powerful that it’s invincible.”
 Dao Sovereign shook his head. “Needless to say, the Primordial Fiendcelestial is only a target.”
 Lao Dan was silent. He stared at the fishing rod, thinking about something.
 Zhao Xuanyuan asked, “What are we waiting for? When are you letting us return to the Heavenly Dao? I want to show my fellow disciples my cultivation level.”
 Lao Dan rolled his eyes and scolded him, “What do you mean, let go? I’m really unlucky to follow you three brothers. I’m often in danger. Go back now if you want to go back!”
 The more he thought about it, the angrier he became. The Primordial Pill was ruined, and he still owed Zhao Xuanyuan a favor. All these years, he had often encountered danger with Dao Sovereign and the other two and had even offended many mighty figures. In the end, Zhao Xuanyuan still did not know how to be grateful.
 “You old man, you’re always anxious. Why does Laozi have a clone like you?”
 “Hmph, I’m not a clone!”
 “Yes, yes, yes. We’re the clones, okay?”
 Zhao Xuanyuan chuckled. As he spoke, he even waved his fishing rod and used his fishing line to disturb Lao Dan, causing the latter to be furious.
 At this moment, a great pressure descended, startling the four of them so much that they suddenly looked up.
 In the Daoist temple, Han Jue, who was cultivating, suddenly opened his eyes and looked up.
 Red Fate was already unconscious and her soul had been sealed by him.
 Following Han Jue’s gaze, layers of golden clouds appeared above the Sage Dao Field outside the 33rd Heaven. They churned crazily and a terrifying heavenly might descended, enveloping the heavens.
 Han Jue narrowed his eyes and deduced. He discovered that the Heavenly Dao seemed to have been stimulated. Its providence boiled and became strange. This was the first time Han Jue saw such a situation.
 He couldn’t figure out the reason for this phenomenon.
 He had no choice but to use the simulation trial to check the surroundings of the Heavenly Dao. He did not discover any enemies.
 Han Jue looked up at the Heavenly Dao again. His gaze pierced through countless layers of space, but he didn’t see the enemy.
 “Why is there such a phenomenon?” Han Jue asked in his mind.
 (900 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 This is already Laozi’s value!
 Continue!
 Han Jue’s consciousness fell into the illusion.
 He opened his eyes and discovered that he had arrived in a sky filled with rolling fog. Looking down, he could not see the continent or the sea. Looking up, he could not see the sun, moon, and stars.
 A mighty and domineering figure was ahead!
  He was bare-chested and held a huge saber that looked like a huge axe. He kept slashing at the cloud wall ahead.
 Every time he slashed, the clouds and mist surged into his body, causing his figure to suddenly increase in height.
 Pangu!
 What was he doing?
 Shocked, he stared at Pangu’s back.
 His back muscles were visually impactful, like mountains pressing together, sinister and domineering
 The cloud wall that couldn’t be seen at the top burst out with light. Above Pangu, a figure appeared in the cloud wall. It was even larger than Pangu and looked divine and dignified.
 Holy Mother of Order!
 “Pangu, how dare you interfere with the Divine Authority!”
 The Holy Mother of Order’s voice was icy.
