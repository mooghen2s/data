 A figure surrounded by raging flames was frantically attacking space in the darkness.
 It was Yi Tian!
 “Damn it!”
 Yi Tian tried his best, but he still couldn’t break through this dark space and find Han Tuo, who was deep in the endless abyss.
 It had been a long time since Yi Tian felt so helpless.
 Han Tuo had been protecting him ever since he obtained the Primordial Chaos Dao Fruit. He had finally awakened as a Chaotic Fiendcelestial and inherited the power of the Connate Great Dao, but he still couldn’t save Han Tuo.
  This aggrieved feeling almost made Yi Tian go mad.
 Why?!
 Why am I so weak?!
 I, who have no parents, can’t even save my only brother. What’s the difference between me and an ant?
 Yi Tian roared angrily. He could only hold these words in his heart.
 A laugh sounded at this moment.
 “Give up, young Chaotic Fiendcelestial. It’s impossible for you to break through the Endless Abyss. The difference in cultivation level between us is too great!”
 This voice was filled with disdain and mockery.
 Yi Tian stopped and turned around. “Come out! Suppress me or kill me if you have the
 guts!”
 Laughter followed. “Why should I kill you? I don’t want to kill him, either. I want the two of you to submit to me. You can obtain potential that surpasses the Chaotic Fiendcelestials!”
 A white figure suddenly appeared in front of him and pointed at his forehead as soon as he finished speaking. In an instant, the flames on his body dispersed and revealed his true body.
 Yi Tian’s eyes widened in disbelief.
 The white figure was a humanoid and had a human figure. Its surface was pale like jade and wrinkle-free. It wore a stone mask without eyes. Behind the mask was long hair formed by black worms that twisted wantonly.
 Yi Tian could not move. He gritted his teeth and asked, “Who are you?”
 The white figure laughed strangely. “You can call me the Devil Ancestor.”
 Devil Ancestor?
 Yi Tian frowned and asked, “The Devil Ancestor of the Heavenly Dao?”
 “That’s only one of my Dharma Idols. The three thousand worlds of the Chaos all have my Dharma Idols. I helped countless worlds form rules. I’m the oldest Chaotic Fiendcelestial. The Chaos was still in its original state when I was born. There was no world or living beings. It was gray, and I felt that that was the most beautiful appearance.” The Devil Ancestor smiled teasingly.
 as
 Yi Tian shivered.
 What did this fellow mean?
 Did he want to destroy everything and make the Chaos return to its original state?
 The Devil Ancestor said, “Actually, I think very highly of the two of you. That’s why I spent time dealing with you. Submit to me. I will establish a new order and stand above everything. I will be the only god, and you will be second only to me!”
 Yi Tian was silent.
 The Devil Ancestor spoke patiently, “What can you obtain by fighting for the Evil Heavenly Emperor? Back then, when the Evil Heavenly Emperor was still in the Heavenly Dao, he also asked my Dharma idol for help. He begged me to let the Devil Race sweep through the mortal world and slaughter all living beings every time they lost their faith in the immortals, giving the immortals a chance to be the saviors. What are you pursuing when you fight for such a person?”
 Yi Tian was moved. He didn’t expect the Evil Heavenly Emperor to have done this before.
 “I want the Chaos to restart, just like how the Heavenly Dao restarted. Only by cleansing can we be reborn. The current Heavenly Dao is close to perfection, but it’s still a little short of true peace. It’s mainly because your brother’s father isn’t determined enough and still relies on those Sages to establish order.” The Devil Ancestor’s tone became regretful when he mentioned Han Jue.
 Yi Tian gritted his teeth. “Won’t we help you kill the people around us if we follow you?”
 The restarting of the Chaos meant slaughtering all living beings in the Chaos!
 The Devil Ancestor smiled. “Since you’re on our side, I’ll definitely take care of you. I’ll protect the people you care about.
 “You have no room to refuse. Either submit to me or die.”
 Yi Tian was furious, but he was helpless. He asked, “Why did you choose us?”
 Yi Tian was silent.
 The Devil Ancestor smiled. “There’s not much time left. My patience is about to run out.”
 Yi Tian took a deep breath and said, “Alright! As long as you’re willing to let my brother
 go!”
 The Devil Ancestor’s mask began to twist as a strange smile appeared on the stone surface.
 “You won’t regret it!”
 Inside the Daoist temple.
 Han Jue opened his eyes. He had been in seclusion for eighty thousand years.
 Indeed, after reaching a million years old, the choice reward would not be triggered every hundred thousand years. It would probably only be triggered once every million years.
 Fortunately, Han Jue was already strong enough and didn’t have much desire for the system reward.
 He wanted to continue cultivating.
 However, he had been feeling uneasy recently.
 He pinched his fingers to deduce, but he couldn’t figure out where this feeling came from.
 Strange.
 He was a Great Dao Sage. Everything was in his control unless it involved an existence stronger than him.
 Han Jue checked the emails. Perhaps he could find an answer from his friends.
 [Your good friend Dao Sovereign has obtained a Supreme Treasure. His providence has increased greatly.]
 (Your good friend Evil Heavenly Emperor was attacked by your son Han Tuo and was severely injured.)
 (Your good friend Yi Tian was attacked by an Immortal God] x78920

 (Your good friend Qin Ling was attacked by your good friend Yi Tian and was severely injured.)
 (Your good friend Daoist Destiny discussed the Dao with a mysterious mighty figure.]
 (Your disciple Ji Xianshen accidentally entered the Chaotic Mystic Realm. His providence has increased.]
 Eh?
 What was going on with Han Tuo and Yi Tian?
 Han Jue checked their portraits and discovered that their cultivation levels had already reached the late-stage Primordial Chaos Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm.
 So fast!
 Han Jue narrowed his eyes.
 A word appeared in their providence information.
 Inheritor of the Devil Ancestor!
 Devil Ancestor?
 Han Jue immediately used the derivation function.
 “I want to know who the Devil Ancestor who gave Han Tuo and Yi Tian the inheritance is?”
 [400 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 (Devil Ancestor Lu Yuan: Mid-stage Great Dao Supreme Realm, Dao Ancestor’s Devil Heart, Myriad Devil Ancestor, one of the ancient Chaotic Fiendcelestials]
 Han Jue frowned. Great Dao Supreme Realm!
 “I want to know my chances of winning against the Devil Ancestor Lu Yuan?”
 [400 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 (You have a 60% chance of killing the Devil Ancestor Lu Yuan.]
 Han Jue frowned.
 It’s too dangerous!
 He couldn’t attack. He could only use the Book of Misfortune!


 “Let’s understand the situation first.”
 Han Jue frowned and thought. What if Lu Yuan was Han Tuo’s master? Wouldn’t he curse his own ally to death?
 Han Jue sent a dream to Han Tuo next.
 The dream was a beautiful place with mountains and rivers.
 Han Jue discovered that Han Tuo had changed.
 Apart from his body being stronger, his face was a little weathered. His white hair was tied behind his head by a blood tendon, and only two thin strands of hair were left on his forehead.
  Han Jue wanted to ask him why he wanted to severely injure the Evil Heavenly Emperor, but his heart softened when he saw him like this.
 He must have had a reason.
 /
 Han Tuo suddenly opened his eyes. After seeing Han Jue, he was stunned and hurriedly stood up to bow. However, he was no longer as excited as before and looked very calm.
 He had indeed grown up.
 Han Jue asked, “How have you been?”
 Han Tuo hesitated for a moment but still told him the truth. From being trapped in the Endless Abyss to being subdued by the Devil Ancestor Lu Yuan and recently following him to explore the Chaos. They were trying to help the Devil Ancestor recover his main body.
 Han Jue narrowed his eyes and asked, “This Devil Ancestor has yet to recover his main body?”
 Han Tuo nodded. “His body was destroyed by Pangu, and his soul was suppressed in the Ancient Desolate by the Dao Ancestor for countless years. He needs time to recover.”
 He hesitated, his eyes worried.
 Han Jue asked, “What are you trying to say?”.
 Han Tuo took a deep breath and said, “I injured the Evil Heavenly Emperor not because I attacked him. It’s just that he and Zhou Fan want to save me and Yi Tian. I’ve let His Majesty down, but I want to try something with the Devil Ancestor. I hope that Father can forgive me.”
 He knew Han Jue’s relationship with the Evil Heavenly Emperor, so he was worried.
 Han Jue asked, “Why do you want to follow the Devil Ancestor?”
 Han Tuo looked up at him with a firm gaze and said, “I want to find the meaning of my existence. I’ve been following His Majesty and fighting and killing countless people. Although the Heavenly Court has been strengthening, I can’t find my own meaning. I might be able to find it if I follow the Devil Ancestor.”
 Han Jue was speechless.
 Looking for meaning?
 Did he have nothing better to do?
 Survival was the greatest meaning!
 However, Han Jue couldn’t criticize him directly when he saw Han Tuo’s gaze.
 Everyone had their own ambitions. Han Jue’s previous path was not understood by others. The people around him thought that he was timid and afraid of trouble. He used his strength to prove that he was right.
 At least, Han Jue was very firm at the beginning.
 Han Tuo had experienced all sorts of things in life. He had experienced all the emotions and desires. He had also experienced the extreme sense of achievement and the sense of failure that almost caused him to collapse. At his realm, it was already very difficult for him to encounter enemies. It was indeed easy to be confused.
 Han Jue asked, “Then, can you tell me why the Devil Ancestor wants you?”
 Han Tuo did not hide anything.
 Han Jue didn’t panic knowing that the Devil Ancestor actually wanted to restart the Chaos. Instead, he was a little teasing.
 Life, the Fiendcelestial Race, the Devil Ancestor, the Great Dao Divine Spirit, and so on. More and more major factions began to integrate and appear. To Han Jue, it was a good thing. The more chaotic it was, the harder it was for his identity to be exposed.
  The fact that Han Tuo could tell him the Devil Ancestor’s intentions meant that the Devil Ancestor did not use any method to brainwash him. Otherwise, he would definitely keep it a secret.
 “Have you really thought about it? This path will be very difficult and you will encounter many troubles,” Han Jue asked.
 Han Tuo said with a firm expression, “At first, I refused. Later, the Devil Ancestor let me see many things, so I decided to follow him. If the Devil Ancestor really has cultivation that can overturn everything, I will ask him to protect the Hidden Sect. If the Devil Ancestor fails, I will sever my relationship with you and not cause trouble.”
 This was indeed an investment. No matter what, Han Jue didn’t lose out.
 Han Tuo had lost too many people in his life. Han Jue was the only one left, and he was too powerful. He had no ability to repay Han Jue at all. Instead of that, it was better to follow the Devil Ancestor and fight for a chance of survival for him.
 Han Jue was silent. He could sense Han Tuo’s true feelings.
 This kid is underestimating me!
 Han Tuo lowered his head slightly and said softly, “Although you’ve been protecting me, you actually don’t have any expectations of me.”
 Han Jue said, “Why would I save you if I have no expectations?”
 Han Tuo said, “It’s only because I’m your son. The expectations I said have nothing to do with kinship. Just like you, you protected so many people and always cultivated diligently. Isn’t that just not trusting anyone but yourself? In your heart, you never expect others to save you. You only believe that you can protect yourself.”
 Han Jue fell silent again. It had to be said that this kid had seen through him.
 Han Jue indeed didn’t expect much from anyone. He nurtured the Fiendcelestial Army only hoping for it to help him reduce trouble in the future. He never expected the Hidden Sect and the Fiendcelestial Army to save him when he was in danger.
 It was because he would never let himself fall into a desperate situation.
 This was also the reason why he was still in seclusion despite being so powerful.
 “Let me try, Father.”
 Han Tuo stared at him and said word by word.
 The two of them indeed looked like father and son, but Han Tuo looked to be the older one.
 Han Jue said, “Alright, I respect your choice. However, I won’t show mercy to the Devil Ancestor if he dares to threaten me. I hope that you won’t plead for mercy for him.”
 Han Tuo said helplessly, “Why would I plead for him? I’m only doing it for myself. I don’t have a good impression of him.”
 Han Jue removed the dream.
 “Summon me at any time if you encounter a death situation.”
 On a barren land, the bright starry sky looked up.
 Han Tuo sat on the hill and opened his eyes. He was both touched and bitter. “You still think that I can’t...”
 A cold wind blew past, and his white hair fluttered.
 Yi Tian suddenly walked over. Like Han Tuo, his image had changed. He was dressed in sinister black armor and his black hair reached his heels. His face was wild, and even if he didn’t speak, it made people feel that he was arrogant.
 “What are you thinking? The Devil Ancestor is probably about to finish. That fellow is really disgusting. He ate the corpse of an ancient Chaotic Fiendcelestial raw,” said Yi Tian as he sat beside him.
 Han Tuo asked, “Yi Tian, have you thought about why you cultivate? What is the purpose of your life?”
 Han Tuo said faintly, “The Great Sage Equaling Heaven became the Victorious Fighting Buddha in the end.”
 Yi Tian smiled confidently. “That’s because he failed. If he succeeded, even Tathagata would have to kneel in front of him!”
 Han Tuo looked at his smile and was lost in thought.
 Yi Tian seemed to be always so optimistic and heartless.
 Yi Tian sensed his emotions and patted his shoulder. He smiled and said, “Don’t think about this all day. You still have a father to rely on. Do you know that you won’t die no matter what, so you want to find trouble for yourself?”
 Han Tuo scolded him jokingly. “What do you know? I’m thinking. Thinking. Do you understand?”
 Yi Tian grinned. “You won’t even have the energy to think when I surpass you and step on you. You can only think about how to surpass me!”


 Any existence with intelligence would always encounter a moment of confusion.
 Han Jue knew this very well. He was often confused.
 For example, now, he only had a 60% chance of winning against the Devil Ancestor. Most importantly, the other party was still recovering his strength.
 This was not good!
 Han Jue had no choice but to take out the Book of Misfortune and the Heavenly Dao Spirit Stone and start to fuse them.
 Then, he sent a dream to the Evil Heavenly Emperor.
 The dream was still the forest outside the Jade Pure Sacred Sect.
 He was the first to speak, “Sorry, I didn’t protect your son well.”
 /
 Han Jue smiled. “I should be the one apologizing to you. This kid is not in his right mind. He hurt you. Don’t blame him.”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor shook his head. “How can I blame him? He has already contributed enough to the Heavenly Court. I won’t stop him if he really wants to leave. Besides, the one who injured me was actually not him. It was mainly the power of the Devil Ancestor who injured me through his body. He was also very panicked and blamed himself. I can tell.”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor sighed as he mentioned this.
 Actually, he had already experienced such a situation.
 Humans strive for greater heights. He had sent many geniuses to Sage Sects, so he was not affected.
 Han Jue asked, “Why didn’t you summon me back then?”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor replied, “This Devil Ancestor is not simple. He’s ancient. He once followed Pangu for an era and later became the Dao Ancestor’s mental demon. Although he was severed by the Dao Ancestor, he has already established an inseparable connection with him. He won’t die if the Dao Ancestor doesn’t die. I don’t want you to provoke such an existence.”
 Han Jue frowned. So exaggerated?
 The Dao Ancestor was one of the final bosses.
 He was not easy to deal with!
 Although his tone was a little regretful, it was also filled with anticipation.
 “Oh? You seem to have a high opinion of the Devil Ancestor?” Han Jue asked.
 “Before Pangu created the world, not all the three thousand Fiendcelestials in the Chaos liked to fight. This Devil Ancestor was one of the existences who hated fighting, but he had no choice...”
 Han Jue remained silent.
 It sounded like another sad story.
 Han Jue chuckled. “Really?”
 He suddenly understood why Han Tuo was aggrieved.
 On one side was the Evil Heavenly Emperor who was cheering him on, and on the other was a father like him...
 He was looking forward to Han Jue’s mysterious youngest son. He could actually resonate with Han Tuo’s bloodline. At least, his talent was above Han Tuo’s.
 “Is that so? Unfortunately, I think his potential is definitely good. It’s just that he hasn’t been discovered.”
 “I’ll send him to you to help you expand your territory if I have the chance in the future!”
 “You sound like I’m taking advantage of you.”
 “No, no. The Heavenly Emperor is impartial. How can I dare to think that?”
 “Brat, have you forgotten how respectful you used to be in front of me? Are you not giving me face now?”
  “How can this be?!”
 The two of them began to bicker, the smiles on their faces not disappearing.
 Han Jue opened his eyes. He gave up the thought of settling scores with the Devil Ancestor after chatting with the Evil Heavenly Emperor.
 He would let him go for a while.
 Han Jue was about to close his eyes and cultivate when he suddenly felt a strange fluctuation.
 He suddenly glanced over.
 His gaze passed through the buildings and landed on the Fusang Tree. He saw the space around the Fusang Tree twisting violently.
 Han Jue immediately came to the Fusang Tree. He was about to take action when the Fusang Tree suddenly disappeared.
 The tens of thousands of feet tall Fusang Tree suddenly disappeared, causing a huge visual impact. The Dao Field guards on the tree-Ah Da, Xiao Er, and the Black Hell Chicken, landed one after another, all looking stunned.
 At the same time, the uneasiness in Han Jue’s heart disappeared.
 He was enlightened.
 It turned out that his uneasiness was not because of Han Tuo, but because of the Fusang Tree.
 He used the simulation trial to check his surroundings and did not discover any mysterious enemy.
 He didn’t dare to pursue rashly. How terrifying would it be to pass through the Dao Field array formation if a mysterious mighty figure really attacked?
 Han Jue disappeared after saying, “Continue cultivating. Pretend that nothing happened.”
 He returned to the Daoist temple and began to deduce.
 Soon, he caught sight of the Fusang Tree.
 After all, the Fusang Tree was far weaker than him. Han Jue didn’t even need to use the derivation function and could deduce it himself.
 However, Han Jue didn’t expect the Fusang Tree to be so far from the Heavenly Dao.
 It was even further than the Grand Primordium Domain!
 The Fusang Tree appeared in a dark space filled with rolling Chaotic Qi. There were no living beings around.
 Its branches began to tremble. The leaves kept leaving and turned into dust, forming little stars that lit up the surroundings.
 Han Jue didn’t deduce any other existence. Could it be that the Fusang Tree wanted to leave?
 But how could it be so capable?
 “Who helped the Fusang Tree escape the Hundred Peak Immortal River?”
 (1 quadrillion years will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Dao Creator?
 Continue!
 Han Jue’s heart sank.
 [Space Origin. The Fusang Tree wants to transform strongly and has touched the Space Origin. Under its will, the Fusang Tree came to the Primordial Zone of Chaos and is preparing to transform into all things. It wants to use the Great Dao merit to transform.]
 The Fusang Tree had indeed mentioned that it wanted to transform a long time ago, but it was a Primordial Divine Tree and was restricted by special rules. Even Han Jue, the Great Dao Sage, could not help it forcefully transform. He had suggested that the Fusang Tree give up its body, but it did not immediately agree.
  Han Jue wanted to ask the Fusang Tree, but he didn’t know what to ask.
 The current Dao Field no longer needed the Fusang Tree to provide Spirit Qi. Since he couldn’t help it, why not let it pursue its own
 path?
 Han Jue retracted his gaze and sighed.
 He was not sad.
 Han Tuo, Fusang Tree, Dao Sovereign, Zhou Fan, and the others began to take charge and had their own paths to pursue.
 They were no longer weaklings who needed his protection.
 “In that case, I have expectations for you. I look forward to whether you can surprise me in the future. However, it’s impossible for you to surpass me,” Han Jue muttered to himself with a firm gaze.


 They thought that the Fusang Tree’s disappearance was his doing.
 Han Jue entered his cultivation state.
 Years passed.
 Time passed quickly.
 Fifty thousand years passed in the blink of an eye.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and slowly stood up.
  Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du sent a voice transmission to him several hundred years ago, telling him to go to the Universal Hall after his seclusion ended.
 Han Jue jumped into the Universal Hall. Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du opened his eyes and sent a voice transmission to the other Sages.
 Sitting beside him, Han Jue chuckled and said, “Your cultivation level has increased quite a bit recently.”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du smiled. “It’s all thanks to the providence of the Heavenly Dao. Not only me, but the other Sages have also improved.”
 Before the Heavenly Dao restarted, the cultivation levels of the Sages might not increase even after tens of billions of years.
 Soon, the other Sages arrived.
 There was another new Sage in the Heavenly Dao. He was the famous Divine Might Buddha, hailing from the Buddhist Sect.
 The Buddhist Sect already had three Sages.
 Qiu Xilai began to exert his strength.
 The other Sages had nothing to say about this. The Divine Might Buddha was indeed powerful. Be it cultivation, providence, or reputation, he was unique in the current Immortal World. It was really unreasonable that even he couldn’t attain the Dao.
 Han Jue had heard of the Divine Might Buddha before, but this was the first time he saw him in person.
 The Divine Might Buddha was actually thought to be the disciple of the Divine Might Heavenly Sage ever since the name of the Divine Might Heavenly Sage spread.
 The Divine Might Buddha did not deny it. He had already learned of the Buddhist Sect’s stance from Qiu Xilai.
 After all the Sages sat down, Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “Let’s talk about the previous alliance between the hundred worlds. We have already reached a preliminary agreement. In the future, we will advance and retreat together. The Heavenly Dao is one of the main alliance masters…”
 Han Jue was not interested in socializing, so he checked the emails.

 [Your good friend Yi Tian received guidance from a mysterious mighty figure and learned a Great Dao Mystical Power.]
 His circle of friends became more and more interesting!
 Amazing!
 This also showed that the situation in the Chaos was changing!
 Han Jue suddenly frowned.
 Would the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity be brought forward?
 It was not to the extent that as long as the Primordial Fiendcelestial did not appear, the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity would not begin.
 At most, there would be a few ordinary calamities in advance.
 Han Jue saw that Han Tuo and Yi Tian had both learned a Great Dao Mystical Power. It seemed that the Devil Ancestor Lu Yuan was still something and taught the two juniors seriously.
 He continued reading the emails.
 The new Sages were filled with reverence for him. As expected of a mighty figure who was on par with the Divine Might Heavenly Sage.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du continued, “Recently, two powerful factions have appeared in the Chaos. One is the Devil Ancestor who escaped from the Ancient Desolate. He’s wantonly recruiting troops and buying horses. His targets are mainly young geniuses. We need to be wary of this matter. The second is the Eternal Divine Clan. The Eternal Divine Clan is made up of Eternal Deities. The so-called Eternal Deities are a type of Transcendent Deity. Although they don’t grasp the rules like the Great Dao Deities, they are still extremely powerful. As the name implies, Eternal Deities are eternal existences. Every Eternal Deity is an existence that can’t be killed…”
 The Sages glanced at Emperor Xiao when the Devil Ancestor was mentioned.
 Emperor Xiao was expressionless as if the matter had nothing to do with him.
 Han Jue was interested in the Eternal Deities.
 He remembered that Dijun was an Eternal Deity. Could it be that Dijun could not be killed?
 “How do I kill an Eternal Deity?” Han Jue asked in his mind.
 (200 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 (Kill his true body and the Eternal Dao Fruit.]
 Eternal Dao Fruit…
 The Eternal Dao Fruit represented the Eternal Rule?
 How were rules different from the Great Dao?
 Han Jue didn’t continue to use the derivation function. He could seek answers to these questions in his cultivation. There was no need to waste his lifespan.
 The Sages began to discuss how to prevent the approach of the two powerful factions. The Eternal Divine Clan could be ignored for the time being as they were far from the Heavenly Dao. But the Devil Ancestor was different. There were countless devils and fiendish cultivators in the Heavenly Dao.
 Emperor Xiao said, “I will unite the demonic path and not give the Devil Ancestor a chance.”
 Qiu Xilai said in a strange tone, “I wonder if Fellow Daoist Xiao is still related to the Devil Ancestor?”
 Emperor Xiao snorted. “I would have left long ago during the Heavenly Dao calamity if so. Why would I guard the Heavenly Dao so bitterly?”
 The other Sages felt that it made sense.
 Almost all the older generation of Sages had severed ties with their backgrounds. Although they later became friends again, they no longer followed the orders of those Great Dao Sages.
 They belonged to the Heavenly Dao now! “Continue to follow the cultivation spirit of fighting for the Heavenly Dao. This is the best way. Some geniuses will definitely be poached. What we can guarantee is that most of the geniuses care about the Heavenly Dao,” Heavenly Venerate Wufa said.
 The other Sages spoke.
 Han Jue didn’t interrupt. He was not interested in these things. He couldn’t be bothered to interfere and believed that the Sages could handle it well.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du had especially called him. There was probably something important later.
 Just as the Sages were discussing, an extremely loud voice came from outside the hall.
 “I am a descendant of Pangu, Xia Zhizun. Today, I am here to challenge a Sage!”
 The Sages had strange expressions.
 Han Jue was amused.
  There was such a good show?
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du asked, “Whose disciple is Xia Zhizun?”
 Surpass Pangu?
 The Sages revealed looks of disdain.
 Xu Dudao said in a strange tone, “We have to punish him if we don’t kill him. Otherwise, where will our dignity as Sages go? Today, there’s Xia Zhizun, and in the future, there’s Chen Zhizun, Kong Zhizun, and Tang Zhizun. Isn’t this absurd?”


 “That’s right. He has to be punished for challenging the Sages’ authority.”
 “Let him reincarnate and cultivate again?”
 “Too ruthless. It’s not easy to nurture a prodigy.”
 “The Heavenly Dao still lacks prodigies?”
 “The key is whether we should attack. Won’t we be bullying the weak?”
 The Sages began to discuss Xia Zhizun.
 Speechless, Han Jue said, “Don’t lose the big picture for a small matter. Let’s see what he does next before making a decision.”
 The Sages smiled awkwardly and continued discussing the previous matter.
 At the same time, outside the hall.
 A white-robed man stood in the void. He had a handsome face and an imposing appearance. His every move emitted the aura of an expert.
 Xia Zhizun, the number one prodigy of the Divine Palace!
 He believed that he was also the number one prodigy of the Heavenly Dao!
 He suddenly wanted to challenge a Sage!
 However, in the vast Chaos, it was extremely difficult to encounter a Sage.
 He could only return to the Heavenly Dao and at least know that the Sages were outside the 33rd Heaven.
 “Why are you ignoring me?”
 Xia Zhizun frowned. He also knew that his cultivation was a little low, but he really couldn’t restrain his desire to challenge a Sage.
 He was in a dilemma. Disciples were cultivating in the various Sage Dao Fields outside the 33rd Heaven. They were all experts in the Immortal World. Wouldn’t he be embarrassing himself and make all living beings laugh at him if he left like this?
 Wouldn’t he offend the Sages if he barged into the Sage Dao Field?
 He was no match for a group of Sages no matter how powerful he was!
 Xia Zhizun felt some regret.
 He could only force himself to continue waiting
 Several hours later, the Sages discussed how to consolidate the loyalty of the geniuses to the Heavenly Dao.
 Unlike before the Heavenly Dao restarted, the current calamity was mainly to let all living beings vent. Although it was peaceful now, many cultivators used the rules of peace to bully the weak.
 It was very difficult to achieve true peace!
 Han Jue asked, “What form will the calamity take?”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “I’ve thought about it repeatedly. It’s not a good thing to directly start a war. Then, the rules of the calamity should die with the old Heavenly Dao. I plan to focus on the Human Race, the Divine Palace, and the Buddhist Sect and let Qin Ling reincarnate as a mortal. Because he suffered when he was young, his clansmen were accidentally killed by the Buddhist disciples when they were subduing demons. With such a background, he joined the Divine Palace by chance and became a prodigy.
 “In order to take revenge, Qin Ling wants to overthrow the Buddhist Sect. During this period, the other Sage Sects and races can join. They can either support Qin Ling or the Buddhist Sect. The Buddhist Sect also wants to maintain the rules of peace.
 This script was not bad.
 Han Jue was satisfied. It was equivalent to giving Qin Ling fame.
 The Buddhist Sect might be despised in the early stages, but it would be cleansed again and even obtain the participation of a large number of disciples after the calamity ended.
Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n)) Qin Ling was Han Yu’s most precious grand-disciple. Han Jue naturally couldn’t let him suffer.
 Han Jue said, “Qin Ling’s body was left in the Hidden Sect and his soul was reincarnated. When taking revenge, he couldn’t defeat the mighty figure of the Buddhist Sect and felt despair. Later, Li Xuan’ao informed him of his background in his previous life, so he went to the Hundred Peak Immortal River and knelt down to seek strength. I then returned his body and let him escape the suffering of the mortal world. At the same time, he recovered his strength and ended the calamity.”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du praised, “Good idea.”
 The other Sages of the older generation agreed. Qiu Xilai had no objections. It looked like the Buddhist Sect was at a disadvantage, but it would benefit the most as long as the calamity went smoothly.
 The main philosophy of the Buddhist Sect was to ensure peace for all living beings.
 The new Sages had strange expressions.
 Was this the truth of the calamity?
 The new Sage recalled the legendary calamities and couldn’t help but be terrified.
 Qiu Xilai smiled. “I agree.”
 Zhang Guxing hesitated.
 This was courting death!
 However, he was afraid of being played by the other Sages.
 Zhang Guxing looked at Han Jue with a pleading gaze.
 Han Jue said, “I think it’s feasible. In the next life, Xia Zhizun will be Qin Ling’s best brother in the Divine Palace. The two of them will fight against the Buddhist Sect together and finally return to the Divine Palace.”
 What he meant was that he wanted to protect Xia Zhizun!
 Sages, don’t play tricks!
 Zhang Guxing heaved a sigh of relief and looked at him gratefully.
 The other Sages praised Han Jue for his benevolence.
 Jin Shen sighed secretly.
 Authority was so disgusting.
 Xia Zhizun also involved Pan Xin. After all, he was a descendant of Pangu. Unfortunately, Pan Xin was not in the Heavenly Dao right now. However, with Han Jue’s agreement, there was no problem. The calamity could already be prepared.
 The matter of the calamity was settled.
 Han Jue disappeared.
 The moment he left, the Sages relaxed and began to laugh. They were not as serious as before.
 Li Taigu said meaningfully, “Zhang Guxing, you’re still too lax with the Divine Palace. Even if Xia Zhizun can escape today, can Senior Han save the second Xia Zhizun?”
 Zhang Guxing sighed. “We should indeed discipline him strictly.”
 He stood up and prepared to teach Xia Zhizun a lesson.
 He had lost all his face today.
 After returning to the Daoist temple, Han Jue sent a dream to Zhou Fan and told him about the calamity. He then asked him to tell Qin Ling to hurry up and return.
  Qin Ling would suffer in the calamity, but after the calamity ended, he would obtain a huge amount of Heavenly Dao providence that could increase his cultivation. At the same time, his name would be passed down in the Heavenly Dao for ten thousand years. He would receive countless benefits if he constantly absorbed faith.
 “Is this a Sage? Interesting,” Han Jue muttered to himself as he opened his eyes.
 It had to be said that the feeling of deciding the fate of all living beings was wonderful. No wonder the Sages were obsessed.
 Han Jue was not a good person, but he was not a bad person either. In his opinion, such a calamity was good. It was better than accumulating conflicts, causing chaos to break out sooner or later.
 He had to sacrifice something if he wanted the entire Heavenly Dao to maintain a good development.
 Han Jue began to observe the Heavenly Dao and took in the various forms of life.
 The number of ghosts in the Immortal World and the myriad worlds was indeed increasing. Although it couldn’t affect the Heavenly Dao for the time being, the speed was indeed not optimistic.
 No wonder Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du wanted to prepare for the calamity.
