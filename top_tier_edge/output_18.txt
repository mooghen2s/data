 “I’m about to break through.”
 Han Jue felt his cultivation and thought happily. He first observed the Immortal World.
 The Chaotic Heavenly Road had been established for more than three thousand years, but it did not form a lively atmosphere. Not many living beings even headed to the Chaotic Heavenly Road.
 Han Jue counted with his fingers with a strange expression. It turned out that Pan Xin and Jin Shen had each established a providence sect. Only by joining their providence sect could they step onto the Chaotic Heavenly Road.
 Then, he began to check his emails.
 [Your son Han Tuo was attacked by a mysterious Dao Devil] x10048792
  [Your good friend Evil Heavenly Emperor has stepped into the Sea of Destiny of the Great Dao.]
 [Your good friend Li Yao happened to obtain a Primordial Supreme Treasure. Her providence has increased greatly.)
 So many opportunities! What satisfied Han Jue the most was still Divine Lord Peacock, who was still chasing after the Curse Fiendcelestial. He didn’t know when he could kill the Curse Fiendcelestial.
 If it was a novel or story, an existence like the Curse Fiendcelestial would definitely not be killed by the plot. It would continue to live and step on Divine Lord Peacock one day to provoke the protagonist. However, Han Jue still had a trace of anticipation.
 Wasn’t Divine Lord Peacock the protagonist here?
 “I hope you won’t make me do it myself.” Han Jue thought. He continued reading and discovered some new locations, such as the Sea of Destiny that the Evil Heavenly Emperor was involved in.
 Han Jue was interested.
 After he finished reading all the emails, he directly immersed himself in cultivation and did not have the time to preach to his disciples. He had to break through as soon as possible!
 Dark Forbidden Zone.
 After more than ten thousand years of development, the Great Dao Tower had already occupied an entire space. With the Great Dao Tower as the center, countless lands of different sizes floated around it. Other than the patrolling demons, many living beings could also be seen. These living beings were saved by Zhou Fan from different places. There were many Little Heavenly Dao hidden in the chaos. Because of the invasion of the Inauspicious Evil, living beings wandered around.
 ter.
 Zhou Fan said, “Recently, Inauspicious Evils have been approaching the Great Dao Tower You have to patrol strictly.” “Yes!”
 The dozens of generals replied in unison. | At this moment, an old man stood up and asked, “Your Majesty, the Heavenly Lord of Primordial Beginning has invited you to the Sacred World of the Chan School. Are you going?” Zhou Fan waved his hand and said, “No, I might not be able to return if I go!” The generals couldn’t help but laugh.
 After the Ancient Desolate was broken, the Great Dao Sages seemed to have dispersed. All of them fled the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End and established their own small worlds. This matter spread in the Chaos, causing all living beings to feel that the Great Dao Sages were not absolutely invincible and omnipotent. They were even in a sorry state.
 The Chaos was vast and boundless. The Heavenly Lord of Primordial Beginning had invited many factions. If he didn’t go to the Great Dao Tower, other small factions would naturally also not go. It wouldn’t affect him much.
 “Recently, the Heavenly Dao will send a number of cultivators to help the Great Dao Tower perfect its power structure. You can’t be negligent.” Zhou Fan instructed. He was naturally talking about the Hidden Sect disciples. He had already contacted Li Xuan’ao through the Myriad Worlds Projection. Li Xuan’ao felt that it was a good thing to let the disciples see the Chaos. According to the current development of the Heavenly Dao, they would step into the Chaos sooner or later.
 It was more beneficial for the Hidden Sect to be involved earlier. Zhou Fan also knew that he was not suitable to manage a large faction, so he asked Li Xuan’ao for help. Li Xuan’ao had already nurtured a large number of disciples who were specially sent to help Zhou Fan. The reason why Zhou Fan nurtured forces was actually for the Hidden Sect.
 Then, Zhou Fan explained a few more points to the generals. As a new force, the morale of the Great Dao Tower was still very high. From top to bottom, all living beings had expectations.
 Another five thousand years passed. Han Jue opened his eyes and stretched.
 Awesome!
 He was about to break through! Han Jue was very excited as if he was playing a single-player game. He calculated that he could break through in at most two thousand years. How wonderful. He was only 230,000 years old now. There was hope for him to attain the Great Dao before a million years! After attaining the Great Dao, Han Jue wouldn’t show off to Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du. He wanted to continue cultivating. When he reached the level of a Dao Creator, if the Heavenly Dao ended up in danger, Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du would feel despair, saying that even if Han Jue attained the Great Dao, he wouldn’t be able to save the Heavenly Dao. At that time, Han Jue would attack and insta-kill everything! Han Jue felt great just thinking about it.
 Of course, it would be best if the Heavenly Dao was never in danger. Compared to others looking for trouble, Han Jue hoped to be invincible as soon as possible and do whatever he wanted.
 Han Jue checked the emails. Just like before, there were beatings, opportunities, and new locations. However, nothing caught his attention.
  Han Jue had just finished reading the emails when a figure appeared in front of the Daoist temple.
 Chu Shiren!
 Han Jue let him in.
 Chu Shiren rarely visited him. He probably had something on. Chu Shiren knelt down and bowed, then said, “Grandmaster, I want to go to the Chaotic Heavenly Road.”
 Han Jue asked, “Why?” Chu Shiren said, “I can sense an opportunity waiting for me in the Chaos. No one is scheming against me. I had this feeling in my previous life. In the end, I relied on that opportunity to break through and attained the title of Supreme Buddha.”


 Han Jue remained silent.
 greed!
 “I’m willing to follow Grandmaster and reach the strongest position, creating a truly peaceful and beautiful world!” Such morals and values were amazing.
 Han Jue was speechless. Why are you piling responsibilities on me?
 He said, “In that case, go ahead. I’m just worried that the Chaos is too dangerous. In the future, all the disciples will go to the Chaos. If you die, I can’t save you one by one.”
 Chu Shiren was touched and said seriously, “Don’t worry, Grandmaster. I definitely won’t burden you. Besides, I don’t show my treasures and don’t fight with others. I usually won’t encounter danger. Even if I do, I can rely on myself.” With that, Han Jue had nothing to say. He asked Chu Shiren to go and prepare. Fortunately, there was no prerequisite for the personal disciple to leave with Chu Shiren.
 That day, Han Jue sent Chu Shiren out.
  He looked at the Immortal World and the emails before entering cultivation again.
 2,731 years later.
 Han Jue finally broke through!
 [Name: Han Jue)
 [Lifespan: 234,841 / 9,407,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999]
 ‘[Race: Primordial Fiendcelestial ]
 (Immeasurable Emperor)]
 [Cultivation: Perfected Freedom Primordial Chaos Realm (Perfect Sage)]
 [Technique: Primordial Chaos Reincarnation Great Dao (Great Dao), Heavenly Cycle Body Tempering]
 ‘[Great Dao: Great Dao of Life and Death, Great Dao of Karma, Great Dao of Extreme Origin]
 Looking at his long lifespan, Han Jue was in a good mood. When he broke through to the Great Dao Sage Realm, his lifespan would definitely increase by two digits. Just thinking about it ‘made him feel ecstatic.

 Han Jue didn’t improve his Mystical Powers but checked his emails.
 [Your good friend Evil Heavenly Emperor was attacked by your enemy, Jade Bodhi. He was severely injured.)
 [Your son Han Tuo was suppressed by your enemy, Jade Bodhi. His will was forcefully erased.]
 [Your disciple Zhou Fan has fused with the Great Dao Tower. His body has transformed into a Great Dao Body. His providence has increased greatly.]
 (Your good friend Pan Xin was cursed by a ‘mysterious curse.] ‘
 [Your grand-disciple Chu Shiren has obtained a Chaotic Relic. His cultivation has increased greatly.]
 [Your good friend Divine Lord Peacock was attacked by your enemy, the Curse Fiendcelestial.)
 [Your good friend Empress Houtu has revived the twelve Ancestral Magi. The providence of the Magus Race has increased greatly.)
 Jade Bodhi!
 Great!
  You’re next!
 Han Jue took out the Book of Misfortune and started cursing. It wasn’t easy for him to break through. Killing an enemy to liven things up was also a good thing. He wasn’t afraid of exposing his identity. If the other Great Dao Sages guessed it, it would be a good chance to intimidate them and make them stop attacking the people around him.
 Five days later. Han Jue’s lifespan began to decrease rapidly. On the other side. In a bright hall, majestic Buddha statues stood tall. On a round platform sat two old Daoists.
 It was Jade Bodhi and Jie Yin.
 Jade Bodhi’s expression darkened. “How would I know that Han Jue has such great influence on the Dark Forbidden Lord?”
 Back then, when he first knew Han Jue, this fellow was like an ant. How many years had it been?
 Another strong curse attacked, almost drowning the Jade Bodhi’s will.
 Jie Yin also felt it, and his expression changed. Damn it!
 Why was he so strong?
 It was much stronger than the last time he cursed Cundi!
 Jade Bodhi asked in a low voice, “What should we do? I feel like we can’t take it anymore!” Jie Yin said, “Just go ahead and die. I’ll protect your essence soul. I’ll revive you and Cundi when the Great Dao Calamity descends!”
 Jade Bodhi was unwilling.
 He never expected things to suddenly develop to this extent. “Alright!”
 Jade Bodhi agreed readily and directly perished, leaving only a wisp of his remnant soul to guide him.
 (Because of your curse, your enemy Jade Bodhi died and only a remnant soul is left.] When Han Jue saw this email, the curse missed its target. So fast?
 But on second thought, the other party must be experienced in this.
 But why couldn’t he continue cursing when only a remnant soul was left? Could it be that the other party had used some secret technique? Or perhaps this was the Great Dao Sage. He was still alive and would never die. Then, how was Undying Dao killed by Ancestor Xitian?
 No matter what, it was impossible for Jade Bodhi to cause trouble again in the short term.
 In a mysterious palace. Han Tuo and Yi Tian were imprisoned. There were hundreds of immortals around them.
 Yi Tian teased, “Brother, let’s make a bet. Will Jade Bodhi die an unnatural death this time?”
 Han Tuo rolled his eyes. “Do you really think we’re so lucky every time?” Yi Tian shook his head. “How is it good luck? In my opinion, there’s a supernatural
 existence protecting us. Even a Great Dao | Sage is not his match. You can guess who it is.”
 Hearing this, Han Tuo instantly thought of his father.
  However, he was not sure.
 Was his father really that strong? The last time he visited, his father had even reminded him repeatedly that he could only rely on himself, so he had to be careful.
 Such actions did not seem like those powerful existences who loved their children.
 Han Tuo smiled helplessly. What was he thinking?
 He really believed Yi Tian’s nonsense. They were still prisoners. It was unknown if they could survive. At this moment, a powerful aura attacked from the darkness outside the cage, stirring up a violent wind.
 The immortals stood up in fear. A figure appeared in front of the cage and waved his hand to destroy the restrictions. It was the Evil Heavenly Emperor! “Your Majesty!” The immortals were pleasantly surprised. Han Tuo had a strange expression. Yi Tian patted his shoulder and smiled. “See? I guessed correctly. I just don’t know who that amazing person is.”


 The Evil Heavenly Emperor glanced at him and snorted. “Don’t ask what you shouldn’t ask!”
 “Hehe.”
 Yi Tian smiled as if he understood.
 If the Evil Heavenly Emperor pretended not to know, he would hesitate. Seeing how serious he was, he felt that he had guessed correctly.
 This made sense!
 The Heavenly Court could start from scratch in the Dark Forbidden Zone and even do so much. It was impossible relying on the Evil Heavenly Emperor alone. He definitely had a powerful backer! Han Tuo noticed the Evil Heavenly Emperor’s expression and secretly heaved a sigh of relief. It seemed that it was not his father. It should be someone else. Actually, every time they were captured, it was because the Evil Heavenly Emperor was also suppressed. They were just collateral damage. Apart from not daring to believe that his father was so strong, Han Tuo also did not want to trouble him.
 He had always thought that he was living independently. If every time he was saved, it was because of his father, he would really die of shame.
 Han Tuo placed his attention on himself. A portion of his will had been erased by the Jade Bodhi, but he couldn’t remember what it was. He felt like he had forgotten something and was missing something.
 He was still too weak!
 If he was as powerful as his father, why would he always be so passive?
 A hundred years passed quickly. Han Jue had learned fifty new Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols. He had accumulated 399 Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols.
 It was equivalent to mastering 399 Great Dao powers.
 Of course, he was still far from the true Great Dao.
 One day, he would have to face the enemy personally. At the same time.
 Outside the 33rd Heaven, in the Universal Hall, the Sages gathered. Pan Xin said, “The Chaotic Heavenly Road has already been established. Even if I give up on those thresholds, no living beings can ascend it. What should I do?” At the mention of this, Pan Xin was very depressed.
 He originally thought that the opening of the Chaotic Heavenly Road would make all living beings respect him. He didn’t expect that no living being cared about the Chaotic Heavenly Road at all. He felt like he had punched cotton. It felt terrible! Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “Chaos represents the unknown. It’s normal for all living beings to be unwilling to go. The disciples of the Sage Sects have to lead the way.”
 Pan Xin looked at the other Sages.
 Shi Dudao snorted.
 | All of them actually dared to mock him!
 Heavenly Venerate Wufa smiled. “I will arrange for the disciples of the Wufa Sect to head to the Chaotic Heavenly Road. The other Sages can wait and see.”
 The Sages nodded. Li Daokong glanced at Heavenly Venerate Wufa. This fellow was really tactful. This sentence not only gave Pan Xin face but also allowed the Sages to step down.
 Wow.
 Back then, Heavenly Venerate Wufa was the enemy of the Heavenly Dao. He was really lawless!
 Look at the current situation.
 Li Daokong couldn’t help but admire Han Jue.
 He could actually scare such an unruly expert until his personality changed drastically. Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du changed the topic. “Recently, there’s news from the Chaos that the ancestor has been captured.”
 The Sages were moved. Ancestor Xitian! Ever since the Dao Ancestor disappeared, Ancestor Xitian had taken over the responsibility of protecting the Heavenly Dao. The Heavenly Dao Sages who were born and raised had all heard Ancestor Xitian preach the Dao and had different feelings for him. The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate frowned. “Who captured him?”
 The other Sages also stared at Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du.
 Qiu Xilai asked, “Then what can we do?” An existence that surpassed the Great Dao Sages was not something they could interfere with.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “In the next period of time, a terrifying existence will descend and find Ancestor Xitian’s disciple. We will capture them all. From now on, we will forget Ancestor Xitian and erase the legends that he has spread in the world. You have to warn those cultivators who have received Ancestor’s favor or erase their memories.”
 The Sages looked at each other. Shi Dudao frowned. “That’s not good. If we abandon the ancestor today, we will be abandoned if we encounter trouble in the future!”
 His words hit the heart of the Sages.
 The reason why they could still coexist peacefully was that they had previously fought against the seemingly unstoppable Deity Realm of the Ruins of End.
  Now, Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du planned to beat them back to their original state and make them no longer trust each other. Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said helplessly, “Things are different now. We can still rely on Fellow Daoist Han to deal with the previous enemies. The existence that the ancestor is facing is too strong. It’s so strong that we might die just by thinking of his name. If you violate such an existence, not only will we Sages be affected, but the entire Heavenly Dao will also be affected. “Sacrificing the ancestor to protect the Heavenly Dao is also the ancestor’s idea.” Li Daokong frowned. “Is there really such an existence? How did the ancestor offend him? Because of the Heavenly Dao? Then why didn’t the other party directly destroy the Heavenly Dao?”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du shook his head. “I’m not sure, either. My master said that that existence asked the ancestor about something, but the ancestor refused to tell the truth and offended that existence. In a fit of anger, that existence wanted to erase all karma related to the ancestor and make him cease to exist.”
 The Sages were all shocked, including Pan
 Xin.
 Pan Xin knew that feeling too well.
 When he was weak, Jin Shen was his nightmare. Seeing that the Sages were silent, Pan Xin couldn’t help but mock himself. So what if he became a Sage? It was just changing from a smaller cage to a larger one.


 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du changed the topic and began to mention the recent development of the Heavenly Dao and what the Sage Sect needed to do.
 Twenty years later.
 There were not many personal disciples left under the Fusang Tree. Only the Black Hell Chicken, the Chaotic Heavenly Dog, Ah Da, and Xiao Er were left. The other disciples had already moved out because they were taking in disciples. They found a corner in the Hundred Peak Immortal River to establish a Daoist temple. Seeing Han Jue appear, the Black Hell Chicken immediately flashed in front of him.
 It was very fast!
 Even among Zenith Heaven Golden Immortals, its speed was considered top-notch! The Black Hell Chicken giggled. “Master, why are you here? Are you going to teach us a Mystical Power?”
 With Sages guarding it, no enemy had attacked through the Fusang Tree. The Fusang Tree swayed slightly, and its voice entered Han Jue’s ears, “Master, when can I transform?”
 Han Jue used his Dharmic powers to try to help the Fusang Tree transform. The current Dao Field no longer needed the Fusang Tree to provide Spirit Qi. The Dao Field itself was already filled with Spirit Qi. However, Han Jue discovered that he still couldn’t help the Fusang Tree transform. He could easily kill it and destroy its body and soul, but he couldn’t make it transform.
 How strange.
 However, Han Jue could extract its intelligence and use the power of the Soul Origin Fiendcelestial to create a soul.
 With a soul, it could transform into a Chaotic Fiendcelestial.
 Han Jue said, “Your roots restrict you. You can’t transform.” Fusang Tree was silent.
 “However!”
 “What?” Fusang Tree asked excitedly.
 Han Jue said, “After leaving the Fusang Tree, I can create a new body for you. Are you willing?”
 The Fusang Tree fell silent again. Putting himself in the tree’s shoes, he would also hesitate. “Don’t be anxious. Even if you change your body, you have to cultivate to the Pseudo-Sage Realm. Don’t be in a daze all the time. Cultivate hard and transform as soon as possible,” Han Jue reminded.
 The Fusang Tree was a Connate Divine Tree. Its potential was naturally not bad, but this fellow often stared blankly like a tree without intelligence.
 Hearing this, the Fusang Tree hurriedly said, “Thank you, Master. I will definitely cultivate diligently.” No matter what, there was at least one more hope.
 Han Jue ignored it and continued to observe the spatial vortexes. Several hours later, he left. The Chaotic Heavenly Dog came to the side of the Black Hell Chicken and whispered, “Do you feel that Master seems to have broken through again?” The Black Hell Chicken rolled its eyes and said angrily, “Isn’t that normal?” “But the higher the realm, the harder it is to break through.” “What does a smelly dog like you know? If you understand, are you still a dog? Why is our master the master and you the dog? Don’t you know?”
 The Chaotic Heavenly Dog was silent. It looked at the Black Hell Chicken and gritted its teeth. This stinky chicken only knew how to bully it!
 It regretted leaving back then.
 If it had not left at that time, it would not have fallen behind the Black Hell Chicken.
 If it was one step behind, it would never be able to catch up.
 The difference was even increasing.
 The more the Chaotic Heavenly Dog thought about it, the more depressed it became.
 On the other side.
 Han Jue continued cultivating after he returned to the Daoist temple. He had already reached the perfected Freedom Primordial Chaos Realm. Next, he should think of a way to attain the Great Dao.
 There were pros and cons to the two choices. In short, ordinary Great Dao Sages were safer, but that was almost all they could do. Transcendent Dao Experts had a chance of reaching a higher level.
 After deciding, Han Jue began to cultivate.
 He didn’t know how long the breakthrough would take, but he had expected it to take a long time.
  How could the Great Dao Sage Realm be so easy to reach?
 In the depths of the darkness, a huge mountain range was floating. In one of the valleys, twelve powerful auras gathered. These auras were like flames that shook the mountain.
 One of the figures was Empress Houtu.
 They were the twelve Ancestral Magi!
 The leader was Di Jiang. He was the burliest. He stood in front of a giant statue, praying. An Ancestral Magus surrounded by flames couldn’t help but say, “Brother, are you done? When are you going to attack?”


 “What’s the hurry?!” Before Di Jiang could speak, an extremely sinister Ancestral Magus beside him said coldly. His gaze was also cold like two knives, scaring the Blazing Flame Ancestral Magus into hurriedly shutting up. The other Ancestral Magi did not speak. They were all waiting for Di Jiang to speak.
 Di Jiang slowly turned around and opened his eyes. His sharp gaze swept across the Ancestral Magi. “The revival of the Magus Race this time cannot happen again. We will no longer fight for the Immortal World!” Di Jiang said slowly. As soon as he finished speaking, the Ancestral Magi were moved. The Blazing Flame Magus said angrily, “How can we not fight? We have to at least kill all the demons!”
 In the Immeasurable Calamity back then, the mortal enemy of the Magi was the demons. One controlled the land and the other controlled the sky. After both sides were injured, it gave the humans a chance to rise.
 Empress Houtu said, “There are no more demons in the Immortal World.”
 The Ancestral Magi looked at her in surprise.
 Empress Houtu sighed and told the Ancestral Magi about the changes in the Immortal World. Knowing that the Immortal World was already peaceful and the Sages were harmonious, the Ancestral Magi looked at each other. What a golden age! Di Jiang sighed. “This Han Jue is impressive. Even if his cultivation is outstanding, he isn’t blinded by greed and still maintains his cultivation heart.
  “That’s right. It’s all thanks to his care.” “Speaking of the Nether Race, we should take them back to the Magus Race.” “You’re really funny. He raised the Nether Race for hundreds of thousands of years. He has to return it to you the moment you revive?”
 “No matter what, the Nether Race is still the bloodline of our Magus Race.” “What about the Nether Race’s own thoughts? If they know that their ancestor has revived, won’t they have the intention to return?” Hearing her brothers’ words, Empress Houtu smiled bitterly. She had already entrusted the Nether Race to Han Jue back then. How could she have the face to ask for it back?
 Besides, she felt that the Nether Race might not have feelings for the Magus Race. Back when the Nether Race went to the Heavenly Race, she had tried to contact them, but she had been rejected. The Nether Race only recognized Han Jue. Empress Houtu said, “Don’t think about the Nether Race. Let’s think about where to stay next.”
 Di Jiang pondered and said, “I can’t stay in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End. It’s better to go to the depths of the Chaos and establish a new Heavenly Dao. I’m prepared to imitate Father and transform into all things.”
 Hearing that, Ancestral Magi began to wonder if this method would work.
 Five thousand years passed.
 Han Jue ended his seclusion again.
 There was a door in the Great Dao Realm. When Han Jue arrived at the door, he saw that it blocked many experts. Among them were Divine Lord Peacock and Guan Bubai. Some of them had firm expressions, some were unwilling, and some showed despair.
 Even transcendent existences that stood above all living beings were like mortals in front of the Great Dao, revealing all kinds of things in the world. Behind the door of the Great Dao, Han Jue also saw many figures. They were all Great Dao Sages and Great Dao Divine Spirits.
 He saw some familiar faces among them.
 For example, Undying Dao, Li Muyi, the Chaotic Deity, Ancestor Xitian, and so on. Han Jue was shocked when he saw Li Muyi. He didn’t expect this fellow to also be a Great Dao Sage. What had he encountered that caused his realm to decline?
 He naturally would not ask Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du. Li Muyi’s death was definitely an irreconcilable barrier between him and the Human School. Perhaps one day, he would settle scores with him.
 The Sage Realm was a natural chasm, but which major realm after that was not more difficult to cross!
 Han Jue opened his eyes and heaved a sigh of relief. “Looks like I can’t keep a low profile. Once I attain the Great Dao, I will definitely be discovered.”
 Han Jue thought silently. If he could see the door of the Great Dao, so could the other experts.
 Of course, this was nothing.
 As for letting the Great Dao Sages know, that was even better. It would intimidate them and make them not dare to provoke the Heavenly Dao again. Han Jue habitually checked the emails.

 Who could actually easily suppress Ancestor Xitian!
 Han Jue was very curious. He immediately used the derivation function.
 ‘[1 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 1 quadrillion years!
 Han Jue was shocked. This was not a curse. The value of a Great Dao Sage was only 150 billion years of lifespan. How many times had it increased? This was the first time Han Jue was involved in such an existence. He felt inexplicably nervous.
 What was there to be afraid of!
 He was in the Dao Field. Even a Dao Creator couldn’t spy on the situation inside! Continue!
 When Han Jue made his choice, unlike before, no information popped up. The Daoist temple was silent.
 Han Jue inexplicably felt an extremely strong pressure, making him feel suffocated. How many years had it been? He had almost forgotten this feeling. Han Jue became nervous. About ten seconds later, a line of words appeared in front of him.
 [Chaos Consciousness: Cultivation unknown, Chaotic Deity, Above the Great Dao, Rules and Order, Unspeakable Name.)
 Another line of words appeared in front of him.
 [Unspeakable Name: Special power. Once you say the name, the other party will capture it, even the Dao Field can’t isolate it.]
 Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief. Fortunately, he didn’t have the habit of muttering to himself.
 This Unspeakable Name was so terrifying.
 The other party could sense it just by reading his name? Han Jue thought of Ancestor Xitian again. He was suppressed by such an existence and was finished. Speaking of which, Han Jue had a good impression of Ancestor Xitian. Among the people he knew, only Ancestor Xitian matched his perfect vision of a Dao Pursuer.
 He was extraordinary and had remarkable abilities. He looked silent but also had a hint of pity for all living beings. It was unknown how Ancestor Xitian had offended such an existence.
 The Chaotic Consciousness should be different from the Great Dao Sage and would not covet the Heavenly Dao. He was the god of the entire Chaotic World and was even older than the Great Dao Divine Spirit. He definitely did not care if the Heavenly Dao existed or not.
