 The divine light figure said, “The unchanging Chaos makes all living beings dissatisfied. Since all living beings want to change and break through the inherent situation, I’ll give them a chance. The Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity will still continue!”
 The Holy Mother of Order was silent and fell into deep thought.
 The divine light figure added, “Continue watching him. Don’t let him out before the Divine Authority Generals sweep through the Chaos.”
 The Holy Mother of Order replied, “I understand.”
 The divine light figure on her shoulder vanished as if it had never been there.
 The world fell silent.
 During Han Jue’s cultivation, the situation in the Immortal World changed. As more and more living beings joined the battle of the calamity, negative karma began to appear in the world.
 The outside of the 33rd level became lively. The Sage Dao Field was discussing this calamity.
  Heavenly Dao Palace.
 Dao Sovereign rolled his eyes and said, “In the Divine Palace, the strongest can be conferred the title of Sovereign. My surname is just Dao.”
 “Then, what’s your real name? Dao Xuanyuan?”
 “Hehe.”
 ......
 “Let’s just call him Dao Yi.” Jiang Yi interrupted with a smile. Dao Sovereign wanted to hit someone.
 Su Qi said, “When do you think the Divine Authority Generals will arrive?”
 Fang Liang shook his head, indicating that he did not know.
 Dao Sovereign said, “The Chaos is vast. We have been wandering outside for two million years. The places we have been to are only the tip of the iceberg. They are not worth mentioning at all. It will take a lot of time for the Divine Authority Generals to monitor the entire Chaos.
 “To us, a hundred thousand years is already long enough, but to the Chaos, it’s probably only a few breaths of time.”
 Su Qi and Fang Liang were fascinated.
 Zhao Xuanyuan hesitated.
 Jiang Yi said proudly, “That’s right. The three of us have attained Freedom. Protecting the two of you is nothing difficult.”
 Su Qi said, “Alright, I’ll rely on the three of you then.”
 “Sure, sure.”
 The atmosphere in the Heavenly Dao Palace was harmonious and there was endless laughter. On the other side.
 In the Heavenly Race’s Sacred Palace, Ji Xianshen and Tian Zhan sat opposite each other.
 Ji Xianshen’s eyes flickered as he asked in a low voice, “Really?”
 Tian Zhan nodded. “Really. Yang Che even came to rope me in and said that the Three Pure Sacred World is willing to accept the Heavenly Dao Sages. They have a way to avoid the inspection of the Divine Authority Generals.”
 Ji Xianshen said coldly, “Yang Che is really courting death!”
 Tian Zhan hesitated.
 Ji Xianshen glanced at him and asked, “Tell me, don’t hesitate!”
 “If the rumors are true, how can the Heavenly Dao stop the Divine Authority Generals? Ten thousand Divine Authority Generals! They are all Great Dao Sages!”
 Tian Zhan was excited. He often went to the Chaos and had some understanding of the realms above the Sages. He was no longer as ignorant as before.
 Ji Xianshen frowned.
 “Patriarch, is our Heavenly Race really going to die with the Heavenly Dao?” Tian Zhan clenched his fists.
 “Even Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du has dealings with the Three Pure Sacred World! He might already have a way out!”
 The more Tian Zhan spoke, the more excited he became. Previously, the Heavenly Race was a Heavenly Dao Race. Later, under the schemes of the Sages, they were reduced to doing chores in the netherworld. This had always been a sore point of the Heavenly Race.
 He felt that there was no need to guard the Heavenly Dao!
 Ji Xianshen said coldly, “Do you think I’m doing this for the Heavenly Dao?” Tian Zhan was stunned. “If not for the Heavenly Dao, then what? Could it be…”
 He thought of the Immeasurable Merit Divine Might Heavenly Sage!
 “We can’t retreat if Master doesn’t let us!” Ji Xianshen snorted.
 Tian Zhan was silent.
 Ji Xianshen consoled him. “Don’t worry. Master will bring us to escape if we really can’t defeat them. You might not know much about the Divine Might Heavenly Sage, but I know. If not for my master, how could I be where I am today? How could the Heavenly Race be where we are today? How could the Heavenly Dao be where we are today?”
 Tian Zhan smiled bitterly.
 He knew that the Divine Might Heavenly Sage was powerful.
 But that was ten thousand f*cking Great Dao Sages!
 Ji Xianshen saw the uneasiness in his heart and said, “I know that the current situation looks desperate, but only in desperation can one obtain a huge opportunity. If even Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du leaves and we survive the calamity of the Divine Authority Generals, the Heavenly Dao will be ours!
 “The Hidden Sect is very powerful. You should know!”
 Tian Zhan’s eyes lit up. That was true.
 However… could they really survive?
 Fifty thousand years later.
 Han Jue opened his eyes. His eyes were cold and his body flickered with a faint purple light.
 “Found it!” Han Jue said softly and smiled.
 He had finally found the opportunity to reach the Supreme Realm!
 He estimated that he would break through in at most a hundred thousand years!
 “How long until the Divine Authority Generals reach the Heavenly Dao?” Han Jue asked in his mind.
 (1 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [About 1.5 million years.]
 There were some changes, but it was enough for him!
 Han Jue was in a good mood.
 He first checked his emails habitually. His recent circle of friends was calm, and the number of emails was much fewer than before.
 After reading the emails, he looked at the Immortal World.
 The negative karma in the world became heavier and heavier. Qin Ling and Xia Zhizun had already explored the Buddhist Sect three times and were stopped. As for the Buddha who Qin Ling wanted to seek revenge on, he was imprisoned in the Buddhist Sect and could not appear. It was obvious that they wanted to protect him.
 The Heavenly Dao Immeasurable Calamity would end in at most ten thousand years.
 Then, Han Jue came to the Heavenly Dao Palace.
 Fang Liang, Su Qi, Dao Sovereign, Zhao Xuanyuan, and Jiang Yi opened their eyes one after another. They hurriedly knelt down when they saw that it was him.
 Han Jue called Ji Xianshen and Long Hao over.
 The disciples were very excited to face him and knelt down respectfully.
  Han Jue waved his hand and gestured for them to sit down.
 Ji Xianshen was the first to speak, “Master, a Sage wants to escape the Heavenly Dao. He’s even helping the Three Pure Sacred World and other worlds to poach more Sages.”
 Jiang Yi snorted. “Who’s so bold as to court death?”
 Han Jue thought for a moment and gathered Qiu Xilai, Sect Master Tian Jue, Xu Dudao, Pan Xin, Qiu Xilai, Heavenly Venerate Wufa, and Han Yu.
 There were a total of eleven Heavenly Dao Sages and three Freedom Sages. The lineup was quite impressive.
 The Sages looked at each other in surprise.
 They roughly understood something.
 Han Jue said, “You are all Sages of my Hidden Sect. Now that the Heavenly Dao has wavered, I still need you to stabilize it.”
 He isolated the Heavenly Dao Palace so that no one could spy on it.


 With that said, the Heavenly Dao Palace fell silent.
 Dao Sovereign and the other two were also stunned.
 The Sages here were not all from the Hidden Sect, but Han Jue said that they were?
 Fang Liang asked carefully, “Grandmaster, you mean…”
 Han Jue said expressionlessly, “You can trust each other. There’s no need to pretend anymore.”
 Whoosh,
 The Sages were in an uproar!
 Pan Xin stared at Heavenly Venerate Wufa and cursed, “I knew there was something wrong with you. Your acting is too superficial!”
 Heavenly Venerate Wufa rolled his eyes and said, “What do you know? If I’m not obvious, even Xuan won’t get it!”
  The other Sages also chatted.
 Sect Master Tian Jue looked at Qiu Xilai and sighed. “Fellow Daoist Qiu, you’re also very obvious.”
 Qiu Xilai smiled and said, “Amitabha.”
 ......
 Han Yu looked at the excited Sages and swallowed.
 So many Sages belonged to the Hidden Sect?
 After the Sages chatted for a while and calmed down, Han Jue said, “Who do you think we need to rope in and eliminate among the Heavenly Dao Sages to stabilize the Heavenly Dao?”
 The Heavenly Dao Sages looked at each other.
 They understood what he meant. Heavenly Venerate Wufa smiled and said, “Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du, I think. It’s best to rope him in. After all, he controls the Heavenly Dao.”
 Xu Dudao said, “Yang Che must be eliminated. This fellow is poaching Sages everywhere. What a despicable person!”
 The other Sages spoke.
 Han Jue raised his hand and pulled Yang Che into the Heavenly Dao Palace.
Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎 Yang Che was stunned as he looked at the surrounding Sages.
 Han Jue waved his palm and used the Great Change Sealing Palm to freeze him.
 Yang Che widened his eyes and could not move.
 Han Jue left after saying, “In the future, you can discuss the matters of the Heavenly Dao. I will also keep an eye on the other Sages.”
 Yang Che also disappeared.
 The Sages looked at each other.
 Jiang Yi asked curiously, “Will that Sage die?”
 Zhao Xuanyuan shook his head. “How can a Heavenly Dao Sage die so easily?”
 Qiu Xilai stood up and scanned the Sages. “Since everyone’s already united, think of a way to rope in the other Sages. First, control the power of the various important places near the Heavenly Dao.”
 Heavenly Venerate Wufa glanced at him and did not say anything. The other Sages nodded.
 Although it was a discussion, there should be a leader among them to achieve great things.
 After returning to the Daoist temple, Han Jue directly threw Yang Che into the Primordial Heavenly Prison.
 He looked outside the 33rd Heaven, searching for the other Sages.
 The favorability of the other Sages did not decrease for the time being, nor did they particularly cross the line.
 He could observe again.
 Ten thousand years later, Han Jue placed Yang Che back outside the 33rd Heaven.
 Yang Che returned to his Dao Field. Just as he sat down, Tai Sutian and Jin Shen came.
 Tai Sutian wore white and had a beautiful and cold expression. She frowned and asked, “Yang Che, where have you been all these years?”
 Yang Che opened his eyes and smiled. “I went out for a walk. What do you want?”
 Jin Shen asked, “How many Sages have you roped in?”
 Yang Che said in a low voice, “I thought about it and decided to forget it.”
 Forget it? The two Sages were stunned as they stared at him.
 Yang Che shook his head and did not say anything
 He looked at Tai Sutian and said, “You would rather go to the Three Pure Sacred World than worship Nüwa. I think you have nowhere to go. Why don’t we join forces to serve the Heavenly Dao? This is our home, after all. If you go elsewhere, you will be living under someone else’s roof.”
 Tai Sutian frowned even more.
 Yang Che continued to persuade.
 Jin Shen felt that something was wrong.
 He suddenly thought of something and his expression became strange.
 Could this fellow have submitted to the Divine Might Heavenly Sage?!
 In the Universal Hall.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du and Lao Dan meditated side by side. Their bodies were filled with wisps of green smoke that scattered and appeared occasionally.
 Lao Dan opened his eyes and asked, “What do you think?”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du did not even open his eyes and asked back, “What are you referring to, Teacher?”
 “Of course, it’s the Heavenly Dao.”
 “I’m not thinking about it.”
 “Hehe, do you really want to guard the Heavenly Dao until you die?” “In the past, I abandoned the Human Race for the sake of cultivation. For the sake of freedom, I abandoned the Heavenly Dao. I’m not willing to abandon it anymore. I want to risk it.”
 Lao Dan was silent.
 Lao Dan smiled teasingly. “The reason the Heavenly Dao is targeted is that it’s related to Pangu. The Three Pure Ones have long jumped out of karma. How can they stay below Pangu?”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “Everyone has their own ambitions. I wish Teacher success.”
 “Hehe.”
 Lao Dan shook his head and stood up.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du asked, “Where are you going?”
 “Let’s go see those three silly kids. I have to think of a way to save them so as to not waste so much effort if the Heavenly Dao dies.”
 Lao Dan waved his hand and disappeared.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du sighed.
 In the Immortal World.
 Qin Ling and Xia Zhizun brought the geniuses of the Divine Palace and slaughtered their way into the Buddhist Sect. However, the Sages attacked and suppressed them with a palm.
 The power of a Sage shocked, terrified, and even caused despair to countless living beings near the spiritual mountain.
 Fortunately, at the critical moment, the Sage of the Divine Palace, Zhang Guxing, appeared. The Sage negotiated, and when the situation was at a stalemate, the Buddha who was hated by Qin Ling appeared. He made a great wish and was willing to sacrifice himself to repay his blood feud with Qin Ling. He turned all his immeasurable merit into the power of a great wish and revived all the living beings who had died near the spiritual mountain.
 In this battle, the Sages attacked openly, making all living beings understand that everyone below the Sages were ants.
 Qin Ling and Xia Zhizun obtained a huge amount of Heavenly Dao merit and followed Zhang Guxing to the 33rd Heaven.
 In short, this Immeasurable Calamity had ended successfully.
 After all living beings learned of the cruelty of the Immeasurable Calamity, they respected Sages and cherished peace even more.
 Year after year passed.
 Ten thousand years later.
 Han Jue was still cultivating in seclusion. He had already immersed himself in the impact of the Great Dao.
 On this day.
 Three lines of words appeared in front of him.
 [Detected that you are three million years old and your life has taken another step forward. You have the following choices:)


 (1: Exit seclusion immediately and destroy the ten thousand Divine Authority Generals. Raise the reputation of the Primordial Fiendcelestial. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment, a Primordial Fragment, a Heavenly Dao Spirit Stone, a Supreme Treasure, and a Great Dao guard.]
 [2: Cultivate in a low-profile manner. Your goal is to reach the Great Dao Supreme Realm. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment, a Primordial Fragment, a Creation Spirit Stone, and a Supreme Treasure.]
 Han Jue directly chose the second option.
 Ignore the trap! (You chose to cultivate in a low profile manner and obtained a Great Dao Fragment, a Primordial Fragment, a Creation Spirit Stone, and a Supreme Treasure.]
 (Congratulations on obtaining the Chaotic Supreme Treasure—Chaotic Divine Chain]
 (Chaotic Divine Chain: Defensive Chaotic Supreme Treasure. It is a Supreme Treasure derived from the first wisp of Chaotic Qi at the beginning of the Chaos. It has the defense to resist the invasion of the Chaotic Rule.)
 Another Chaotic Defensive Supreme Treasure!
 Han Jue was not surprised, but he was not disappointed.
 He first fused the Creation Spirit Stone with a ball of Fiendcelestial Q? before taking out the Chaotic Divine Chain and refining it into his Dharma treasure.
  Three hundred years later, this treasure was successfully refined.
 The Chaotic Divine Chain transformed into a silver-white chain of light that landed on Han Jue’s neck, making him feel quite awkward like it was the accessory of a woman.
 Han Jue closed his eyes and continued cultivating.
 No one could stop him!
 …
 In the Universal Hall.
 The Sages gathered and looked at Qin Ling, Xia Zhizun, and the World Salvation Buddha.
 The World Salvation Buddha was Qin Ling’s mortal enemy in the calamity. Now that the calamity had ended, the grudges had dissipated.
 Han Yu looked at Qin Ling with a gratified gaze.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “From today onwards, Qin Ling, Xia Zhizun, and the World Salvation Buddha are all Heavenly Dao Sages. I hope that you can help all living beings in the Heavenly Dao in the future and protect
 it.”
 The three new Sages immediately thanked him.
 The Sages smiled. With three more Sages, the Heavenly Dao became stronger again.
 “It’s not our problem if they want to leave the Heavenly Dao, but they have to drag other Sages along. Such intentions are punishable.”
 His tone was very impolite. Many Sages nodded.
 Heavenly Venerate Wufa chuckled. “Since the calamity has ended and the Heavenly Dao is stable, it’s time to quell the chaos in the Sage level.”
 The atmosphere became subtle.
 Li Taigu, Zhang Guxing, Emperor Xiao, the South Extreme Heavenly Venerate, and the other Sages also began to size each other up.
 In fact, they had all received recruitment offers from the Chaotic forces and were wavering
 The pressure brought by ten thousand Divine Authority Generals was too terrifying!
 Just hearing those rumors made them uneasy.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “I hereby express that I will definitely protect the Heavenly Dao and not abandon it. What about
 you?”
 Qin Ling, Xia Zhizun, and the World Salvation Buddha were puzzled. The Heavenly Dao was facing a calamity?
 Heavenly Venerate Wufa, Fang Liang, Su Qi, Pan Xin, Qiu Xilai, Sect Master Tian Jue, Han Yu, Xu Dudao, Yang Che, Ji Xianshen, Tian Zhan, and Long Hao also promised.
 Qin Ling, Xia Zhizun, and the World Salvation Buddha were the same.
 The remaining Sages had no choice but to promise. At this juncture, whoever dared to reject would be courting death!
 His words received the other Sages’ agreement.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “Although there’s the threat of the Divine Authority Generals, it’s still unknown when they will arrive. The development of the Heavenly Dao still has to continue. We can only summon the living beings of the Heavenly Dao back from the Chaos. We can continue to build the Dark Forbidden Zone near the Heavenly Dao and create more mortal worlds and realms…”
 He began to talk about the plan.
 With the declaration of Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du and the Sages, the Heavenly Dao returned to its original state.
 The most terrifying thing was that the other Sages would quietly slip away when the battle began!
 Pan Xin began to try to create a second Chaotic Heavenly Road. He gave this merit to Jin Shen.
 Jin Shen was not very surprised. He knew that Pan Xin wanted to tie him to the Heavenly Dao.
 However, he could not refuse and could only accept it.
 The other Sages were also creating great merit to benefit all living beings. The entire Heavenly Dao flourished as if it had forgotten the Divine Authority Generals’ existence!
 Han Jue, who the Sages relied on, was still cultivating in seclusion.
 64,820 years passed!
 Han Jue finally had the chance to break through!
 At this moment, the nebulous Primordial Qi in the depths of his soul had already vanished. The entire Primordial World had turned purple.
 A space was formed from the Qi!
 Seven-colored halos appeared around the 10.8 decillion stars. It was beautiful.
 The stars were the Great Dao, and the Great Dao was the stars!
 Han Jue emitted a divine light.
 His Daoist temple could not hide it.
 Divine light soared into the sky and shone on the sky of the Hundred Peak Immortal River, attracting the attention of all the disciples.
 “What’s that?”
 “It came from the Sect Master’s temple!”
 “It should be a Mystical Power. Sect Master is really powerful.”
 “Is Sect Master really still in the Hundred Peak Immortal River? I thought he had already moved to the 33rd Heaven.”
 “I’m not sure. Could it be a breakthrough? It’s said that the Divine Might Heavenly Sage is the strongest prodigy in the history of the Heavenly Dao!”
 “Hiss—he can still break through?”
 can
 Han Jue focused on breaking through and didn’t care about the discussions outside.
 However, this breakthrough was longer than before.
 Three thousand years passed before he finally broke through!
 The divine light dissipated, and countless stars floated in the Daoist temple.
 The Strange Deity had returned at some point and was wandering among the stars, looking very cheerful.
  At this moment, Han Jue’s consciousness had already jumped out of the Heavenly Dao and was quickly rising.
 More and more scenes of the Chaos entered his vision, as if the entire Chaos was rapidly shrinking
 This feeling was very strange!
 After an unknown period of time, Han Jue’s consciousness finally stopped expanding.
 He looked down again. The Chaos had changed. He saw a power, an indescribable power.
 Han Jue’s consciousness entered a sublime state. All the space-time related to him surged into his eyes. The previous and current lives, the past and future. The karma of parallel possibilities. There were countless possibilities of all karma.
 In an instant, he seemed to have lived countless years and countless lives!
 In the end, everything shattered like a mirror!
 Han Jue opened his eyes and looked down at the Chaos again.
 The living beings of the Chaos vanished. The layers of space turned into nothingness, leaving only the three thousand Great Dao interwoven in the Chaos. Above the three thousand Great Dao were seven powerful and mysterious powers. They were high and mighty and absorbed the power of the three thousand Great Dao.


 “Is that the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority?”
 Han Jue looked at the seven mysterious powers above the three thousand Great Dao and was a little curious.
 He noticed a crack on one of the powers. It was obvious.
 Could it be the karma of the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority severed by Pangu?
 This was an unprecedented feeling. It was extremely powerful, even making him feel that he was omnipotent!
 He could shake the situation of the three thousand Great Dao with a wave of his hand!
 Most importantly, he could create reality now!
 With a thought, he could turn his thoughts into reality and put them into the Chaos, forming a true space-time. He could also take it back with a thought. However, the world he imagined would be affected by the power of creation and constantly evolve once it existed for too long
 It was probably the power of Pangu and the Dao Ancestor.
 Pangu had created the world. Perhaps he had not really sacrificed himself. He had only used the power of the Great Dao Supreme to create what he imagined. Then, in this fantasy world, a stunning figure like the Dao Ancestor was born. With his cultivation, he had made the Heavenly Dao an independent existence that could not be taken back.
 ......
 Han Jue’s gaze landed on the power of creation. It was the power that hung above the three thousand Great Dao.
 It was also the strongest power!
 Creation was everything!
 The seven supreme powers did not belong to anyone and were eternally independent.
 The light of the power of creation was the brightest. The endless power of creation turned invisible and split into countless parts that scattered in every corner of the Chaos.
 Han Jue scanned the Chaos. Its vastness surprised him.
 It was true that there was no end to it!
 scene.
 A mysterious power maintained the Chaos at its edge, causing all living beings to reverse direction through this power. The direction they headed was also random. As this power surged, it moved, forming an endless scene, Only by reaching the Great Dao Supreme Realm could one sense that power. It was not the power of the Seven Supreme Rules, but another power, a power that Han Jue couldn’t see through.
 ser
 Of course, the Chaos itself was also extremely vast. According to Han Jue’s estimation, it would take at least a million years for a Great Dao Sage to travel the entire Chaos. This did not include the power of the Great Dao Sage to touch the mysterious border. If he directly touched it and felt dizzy, it would probably take even longer to continue traveling the Chaos.
 It was blank outside the Chaos.
 Absolute blankness!
 In the blank space, there were vaguely some huge bones. There was no life or signs of life.
 Han Jue suddenly saw a figure looking down at the Chaos like him.
 He could not see who the figure was.
 He did not go over rashly. Both sides did not disturb each other.
 Han Jue continued to observe the Chaos. Many areas of the Chaos were isolated by the power of the Great Dao and couldn’t be spied on.
 The power of the Great Dao Supreme was very easy to distinguish. It was different from the three thousand Great Dao and was even more dangerous. It made Han Jue instinctively want to stay away.
 Han Jue continued to immerse himself in it.
 After a long while…
 His consciousness returned to reality and he opened his eyes.
 Countless stars filled his body, dazzling.
 On a whim, Han Jue casually grabbed a star and threw it into the Chaos. In an instant, it landed at the edge of the Chaos. It was extremely far from the Heavenly Dao, so far away that Sages might never reach it.
 Under Han Jue’s gaze, the star exploded in the darkness. It contained the true meaning of the Dao. The Dao gave birth to all things and transformed into a huge galaxy that was still evolving
  With a thought, Han Jue used his will to send a force from the Creation Rule into the universe.
 Perhaps a Great Dao Sage would appear inside. Anything was possible.
 This was the Great Dao Supreme.
 Creating an existence was only a thought.
 As long as no Sage was born in that world, Han Jue could turn them into nothingness with a thought even if the world had countless living beings, as if they had never existed.
 “So this is seeing through the illusion. The voice that spoke to me back then was Pangu, right?”
 Han Jue thought silently and was determined.
 Pangu’s benevolence gave birth to the Heavenly Dao.
 This was also the reason why the Heavenly Dao was unique in the Chaos. Pangu allowed the Dao Ancestor to grow and even control the Heavenly Dao. The other Great Dao Supremes would not allow this to happen.
 Han Jue’s eyes narrowed. The countless stars in the Daoist temple instantly disappeared.
 The Strange Deity was shocked and hurriedly fled the Daoist temple, afraid that Han Jue would discover him.
 Han Jue began to consolidate his cultivation.
 His Dharmic powers had already transformed into Supreme Power. It was no longer Dharmic powers, but a power that was stronger than the Great Dao!
 Han Jue checked his attributes panel.
 (Name: Han Jue]
 (Lifespan: 3,065,120 | 12,049,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,9 99,999,999,999,999]
 (Race: Primordial Fiendcelestial (Immeasurable Emperor)]
 (Cultivation: Early-stage Great Dao Supreme Realm (Perfect Sage)]
 (Technique: Primordial Chaos Reincarnation Great Dao (Great Dao), Heavenly Cycle Body Tempering]
 (Great Dao: Great Dao of Life and Death, Great Dao of Karma, Great Dao of Extreme Origin)
 His lifespan increased by nine digits.
 12 tredecillion years!
 Was this still not eternal?
 Han Jue found it strange.
 Perhaps it was related to the system itself.
 In any case, Han Jue felt that he was already undying and indestructible. Previously, when he spied on the Chaos, other than those unfathomable Great Dao Supreme regions, he didn’t capture the existence of the Dao Creator.
 For example, the Foolish Sword Sage.
 “When will my lifespan be endless?” Han Jue asked in his mind.
  [The lifespan displayed here is your origin lifespan. You can already jump out of time. You can place your main body in a domain without the restrictions of the Supreme Rules as long as you want to. It is already the eternal immortality understood by mortals.]
 Han Jue was enlightened. No wonder those Great Dao Supremes were so mysterious. Even the Great Dao Sages thought that they didn’t exist.
 They only hid outside the rules, like the mysterious sea where the Holy Mother of Order resided.
 In other words, Han Jue could also do this and make himself eternal when his lifespan was about to run out. However, doing this was equivalent to leaving the Chaos.
 Under such circumstances, he could no longer use powers and Supreme Treasures that consumed his origin lifespan.
 Han Jue consolidated his cultivation as he thought.
 Han Jue’s cultivation finally stabilized after thirty thousand years.
 At this moment.
 A notification appeared in front of him.


 [Detected that you have attained the Great Dao Supreme and the essence of life has transformed. You have the following choices:]
 (1: Exit seclusion immediately and create the Primordial Chaos. Your goal is to overturn the Chaos. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment, a Creation Spirit Stone, a Primordial Fragment, and ten Great Dao Sage guards.]
 [2: Cultivate in a low-profile manner and maintain your original intention. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment, a Creation Spirit Stone, a Primordial Fragment, and a chance to activate a new function of the system.]
 Finally!
 Han Jue smiled as he looked at the three lines of words in front of him.
 He silently chose the second option.
 (You chose to cultivate in a low profile manner and obtained a Great Dao Fragment, a Creation Spirit Stone, a Primordial Fragment, and a chance to activate a new function of the system.]
 [The system has activated a new functionSupreme Treasure Fusion Cauldron]
 [Supreme Treasure Fusion Cauldron: It can fuse all Dharma treasures and perfectly inherit the advantages of the fused Dharma treasures. This cauldron is only located in the Myriad Worlds Projection. To use this treasure, one has to obtain the right to enter the Myriad Worlds Projection. Everyone can only use it once every million years.]
  This function…
 Not bad!
 He could still face his disciples. All along, Han Jue had always had a carefree attitude towards his disciples. Other than occasionally preaching, he actually didn’t take much care of them.
 ......
 With the Supreme Treasure Fusion Cauldron, the disciples could obtain powerful Dharma treasures and be grateful to him.
 In addition, Han Jue could also use this function himself.
 Han Jue took out the Creation Spirit Stone and fused it with a ball of Fiendcelestial Qi.
 He first teleported to the second Dao Field and released the Chaotic Fiendcelestial he had created previously to let Murong Qi lead the way.
 In other words, there were a total of 44 Sages in the second Dao Field!
 Murong Qi, the crimson fox, and the Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial were already infinitely close to the Freedom Realm!
 They developed very quickly!
 After Murong Qi led the new Fiendcelestial away, Dao Comprehension Sword looked at him and said, “Master, you seem different? Did you break through again?”
 Li Yao opened her eyes and looked at him.
 Han Jue, who had achieved the Great Dao Supreme, looked no different from before, but it made people inexplicably respectful and didn’t dare to have any profane thoughts.
 Han Jue smiled. “It’s alright. How’s your cultivation recently?”
 He walked towards the two women and sat down, chatting with them.
 After a long while…
 Han Jue returned to the main Dao Field and started to improve his Sword Dao Mystical Powers. He succeeded in just a few hours.
 Then, he switched to cultivating the Grand Unity Aspect.
 Ninety-nine years later.
 Han Jue had learned 500 new Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols and could no longer cultivate. He had accumulated 1,949 Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols!
 He opened his eyes and smiled. He was in high spirits.
 Fight!
 Ten thousand Foolish Sword Sages first!
 A breath later, Han Jue opened his eyes and looked disdainful.
 Double!
 Twenty thousand!
 Instant kill!
 Thirty thousand!
 He killed them in a few breaths!
 Han Jue adjusted his method and insta-killed thirty thousand Foolish Sword Sages several times.
 His Supreme Power far exceeded the Dharmic powers before his breakthrough. Coupled with the power of nearly two thousand Great Dao, it erupted in one go, destroying everything!
 Not only was the body and soul destroyed, but even karma, time, and existence were destroyed!
 Han Jue felt so strong.
 This power was simply indescribable!
 Han Jue changed his method of fighting and created 1,949 Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols. He made all the Dharma Idols contain 12 tredecillion Primordial Stars. The Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols directly sublimated!
 Including Han Jue, it was equivalent to 1,950 Primordial Fiendcelestials!
 Invincibility!
 Indeed, the Primordial Fiendcelestial really expanded rapidly as its cultivation level increased. The higher its cultivation level, the more obvious its advantage!
 Only Supreme Power could truly activate the Stellar Primordial Body!
  He continued to increase the number of Foolish Sword Sages.
 Fifty thousand!
 Han Jue increased the number of Foolish Sword Sages to 100,000 in one go. There was finally a change.
 The hundred thousand Foolish Sword Sages waved their swords in unison. There was actually a scene of the Great Dao fusing. It was extremely domineering.
 Han Jue finally felt tired.
 Unconsciously, a hundred thousand seemed to contain a certain meaning. After the Great Dao fused, the Foolish Sword Sage transformed. He actually had the divine might of a Great Dao Supreme, and not an ordinary Great Dao Supreme at that.
 How terrifying!
 Han Jue barely won after ten minutes.
 He continued to challenge the hundred thousand Foolish Sword Sages.
 After hundreds of battles, Han Jue could finally win forcefully, but he couldn’t insta-kill the hundred thousand Foolish Sword Sages.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and asked in his mind, “Can I insta-kill ten thousand Divine Authority Generals now?”
 (1 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [Yes]
 Safe!
 Han Jue smiled.
 He looked at the Chaos, searching for the ten thousand Divine Authority Generals.
 His vision quickly increased. Just like when his will looked down at the Chaos, he searched for ten thousand Divine Authority Generals from high above.
 Soon, he saw the ten thousand Divine Authority Generals traveling through the chaos. They were still quite a distance away from the Heavenly Dao.
 “If I go to the Chaos now, will the Chaotic Consciousness recognize me as a Primordial Fiendcelestial?” Han Jue asked in his mind.
 (1 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [No, because the Chaotic Consciousness has never seen a Primordial Fiendcelestial. In addition, Pangu severed the karma of the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority, causing the Chaotic Consciousness and the Great Dao Divine Spirits to be unable to deduce karma. They can only look.]
 Eh?
 Even the Chaotic Consciousness could not deduce karma?
 Pangu was something.
 However, just having eyes was enough!
 Han Jue could see the entire Chaos, let alone the Chaotic Consciousness.
 Han Jue thought for a moment and started to search for the Foolish Sword Sage in the chaos.
 He could not find him!
 Could it be that this fellow had also created a domain that belonged to him and was independent of the rules?
 Han Jue used the Dark Nightmare and sent a dream to the Foolish Sword Sage.
 The dream was the Primordial Void where the two of them had fought.
 The Foolish Sword Sage opened his eyes and was moved when he saw Han Jue.
 “You can actually forcefully send me a dream.
 I…”
 He did not sense anything!
 The Foolish Sword Sage was shocked.
 He was a Great Dao Supreme!
 He felt that he was already an invincible existence. In the entire Chaos, only Laozi and Pangu were barely his match!
 Why was this happening?
  The Foolish Sword Sage could not figure it out.
 Han Jue said, “Silly fellow Daoist, long time no see.”
 The Foolish Sword Sage suppressed his fear and shock and said in a low voice, “You can call me Fellow Daoist Foolish Sword or Sage.”
 “Old Fool.”
 “Yes?”
 “Where are you hiding? Why can’t I find you?” Han Jue ignored the Foolish Sword Sage’s dissatisfaction and asked curiously.
 The Foolish Sword Sage felt better.
 That was more like it!
 Foolish Sword Sage said proudly, “Of course, I’m in the Divine Domain I created. Other than me, no one knows where it is!”
 Han Jue said, “Come out quickly. I want to see you. You’re already so strong, yet you’re still hiding. Who are you afraid of?”.
