 Swish! Swish! Swish…
 The sword shadows from all directions sped towards Heavenly Venerate Xun, forcing him to dodge. At first, he could still dodge, but the speed of these sword shadows became faster and faster. In less than ten breaths of time, his body was destroyed by the thousands of sword shadows, leaving only his soul.
 The sword shadows stopped and gave him time to recover his body. Just as he did, the sword shadows attacked again.
 The cycle repeated. Heavenly Venerate Xun was constantly killed and revived. This
 !!
 torture tormented him. He even cursed Li Yao, but unfortunately, he did not receive a
 response.
 At the same time.
 Li Yao and Han Yunjin left the Heavenly Dao and flew towards the nearest world.
 “You still have to be wary of this kid,” Li Yao said meaningfully.
 Han Yunjin said, “No matter what, he’s still my son. He shouldn’t harm me.”
 “Don’t you have any questions about his soul?”
 “What do you
 mean?”
 Han Yunjin frowned.
 Li Yao said meaningfully, “Can’t you sense that in his previous life, he seemed to have a new soul?”
 Han Yunjin nodded. “Isn’t he a new soul?”
 “With his potential, can he be so strong if he’s a new soul? Has his cultivation been taught by you since he was young?”
 “No.”
 Han Yunjin frowned.
 Now he realized that something was wrong.
 Li Yao said helplessly, “How can there be so many new souls? New souls often appear in Connate lifeforms or new races. Most of the descendants of the Han family have their previous lives, including your precious son. I can already sense the power of his Great Dao World. This kid must have been a Great Dao Supreme in his previous life. Perhaps he hasn’t sensed this now, but one day, he will awaken all the memories of his previous life.”
 Han Yunjin was moved.
 A Great Dao Supreme had reincarnated into the Han family?
 His first thought was that it was a scheme!
 A Great Dao Supreme wouldn’t be affected by the cycle of reincarnation. They would either be forced to enter it or on their own accord. No matter which it was, they could choose their background. The providence of the Han family was illustrious, and it was very difficult for ordinary people to reincarnate into their bloodline. The mighty figures were also afraid of misunderstandings and would not easily be affected by karma.
 However, that was only a guess. Heavenly Venerate Xun was indeed his son.
 If it was all calculated in his previous life, he would have no children.
 Li Yao smiled. “I’m just reminding you. In any case, the karma between you and your son has been established. I’ll help you train him during this period of time.”
 “Thank you, Mother.”
 Han Yunjin sighed.
 …
 Ten million years later.
 Han Jue opened his eyes.
 He had wanted to enter seclusion for fifty
 million years, but someone was looking for him, so he had no choice but to stop.
 “Come in.”
 With that, Han Yunjin, who had been waiting
 outside the Daoist temple for millions of years, entered. Han Tuo followed. But he had
 only waited for tens of thousands of years.
 Han Yunjin knelt down in front of him and
 said, “Father, please save my son.” Han Tuo also knelt down and bowed.
 Han Jue didn’t say anything.
 Han Yunjin immediately told him what had
 and open up many worlds. Later, Heavenly Venerate Xun’s cultivation level encountered a bottleneck and he went to find Han Tuo to
 cultivate.
 Han Tuo taught him for a million years and asked Heavenly Venerate Xun to go to the Consciousnessless Domain to find
 opportunities. He did not expect him to
 disappear.
 “I searched for a long time but couldn’t find
 that kid. I can only suspect that it’s related to a Dao Creator.”
 Han Tuo frowned. He was also responsible for this matter. He had wandered in the Consciousnessless Domain before and knew
 there.
 It would have been fine if Heavenly Venerate
 Xun wasn’t Han Yunjin’s son. It was difficult to predict whether he would live or die. With Chu Xiaoqi’s example, Han Tuo felt that Han Jue might care about his grandson, so he came with Han Yunjin to seek help. Han Jue said, “Everyone has their own opportunities. He just disappeared for millions of years. Why worry? Isn’t there a second person among your children who disappeared for millions of years or died young?”
 Han Yunjin hesitated.
 For some reason, Heavenly Venerate Xun was
 once the most rebellious, but he was also the one he cared about the most.
 Han Jue said, “You can leave if there’s nothing else. That kid won’t die.” Hearing this, Han Yunjin looked pleasantly
 surprised. Han Tuo heaved a sigh of relief.
 Han Yunjin bowed and left, but Han Tuo stayed.
 Dao World. Han Jue was not biased and allowed him to sense the basic rules. Even if it was only for an instant, it was
 enough for Han Tuo to get on the right track. One had to condense at least seven Supreme Rules if one wanted to step into the Dao Creator Realm. Han Huang and the Dao Ancestor, who had been the first to create a Supreme Rule, had yet to condense a second Supreme Rule.
 It would be at least five billion years before a new Dao Creator appeared.
 Han Tuo hurriedly thanked him after he woke
 up.
 Han Jue waved his hand and Han Tuo left.
 Han Jue shook his head slightly as he looked at his departing back.
 Among his five children, the one who had the
 least relationship with him was Han Tuo. It was mainly because they had only interacted for a short period of time. Han Tuo was not the kind of person to behave like a child. To be honest, his eldest son was more reliable than his other children. Unfortunately, his potential was not good. He was only at the level of a Chaotic Fiendcelestial.
 After his two sons left, Han Jue looked at the emails and entered cultivation.
 The Endless Era would not bring Han Jue joy before a new Dao Creator appeared.
 Han Jue prepared to enter an unprecedented
 long seclusion.
 …
 Dao Mystic Realm.
 In a grand hall.
 Formless World stood on a platform and
 looked down at the dozens of figures before
 him. Among them were Chu Xiaoqi and Chen
 Jue. Formless World’s expression darkened as he said, “Everyone should understand why I called you here. From today onwards, the Dao
 Mystic Realm is not to fight among themselves anymore. We have to resist the attack of the Primordial Chaos together. Primordial Origin brought billions of Primordial lifeforms and declared that he
 wants to occupy the Great Dao Lake. This
 matter
 is very important. The entire Dao
 Mystic Realm has to join forces to resist him.”
 A mighty figure asked, “It’s said that you
 It was no longer a secret that the Formless
 Transcendent Deity was the backing of
 Formless World.
 Formless World snorted. “The Great Deity supervises the entire Endless Era. How can he
 other. No one dared to refute, but many of them were from various factions, so their
 thoughts wandered. Formless World scanned the surroundings and said meaningfully, “It’s time to take sides. You were only mediocre when you came here. You were like a mortal world that the
 various Great Dao Worlds don’t need. I nurtured you to your current height. I hope you know that this battle is also a test. If you are disloyal, it depends on whether you dare to jump out of this boat.”


 The battle between the Dao Mystic Realm and Primordial Origin quickly began, attracting the attention of the entire Endless Era. This was the first such a large-scale war after the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity ended. In the past, although there were endless wars, in the eyes of the Great Dao Supremes, they were all small fights. But it was different now. The two factions had no less than five Great Dao Supremes and more than a hundred Great Dao Sages.
 It was not only all living beings watching. Even the Dao Creators were watching.
 The Dao Mystic Realm represented the Formless Transcendent Deity. They could use this to probe the Formless Transcendent Deity’s bottom line.
 The Lord didn’t care. The Formless Transcendent Deity was the highest status in the Endless Era. It was precisely because of the Lord that the Formless Transcendent Deity did not dare to act too recklessly, so he had never made any mistakes. It was as if he treated all living beings as equals, but where was absolute equality!
 !!
 Primordial Origin dared to be the first to test the Formless Transcendent Deity’s bottom line. The various factions naturally supported him. Therefore, both sides had no allies in this battle. A third faction wouldn’t dare to interfere.
 There have been very few pure factions fighting without outside interference since ancient times.
 Many mighty figures believed that this battle would decide the future of the next ten billion years.
 If the Dao Mystic Realm lost, it meant that the Formless Transcendent Deity was already restricted by the rules and did not dare to act recklessly.
 If Primordial Origin was defeated, it meant that the faction of the Dao Creator could not be easily challenged.
 …
 In the third Dao Field.
 Han Jue opened his eyes.
 He was already 1.3 billion years old. This seclusion lasted for 500 million years. He had triggered the system’s choice twice in this span of time. As expected, the option would only trigger every billion years after his billionth birthday. The most important thing was that the reward for his billionth birthday was no different from before. He was still
 speechless even now.
 The Creation Heaven’s Chosen had already reached 109.
 He could draw a hundred times today.
 After five hundred million years, the number of Supreme Rules in the Ultimate Origin World had already reached fifteen. He had
 only revealed nine. The other Supreme Rules were hidden; he had to keep some trump cards.
 Han Jue first checked the blank domain.
 The Dao Mystic Realm and Primordial Origin
 didn’t know that his master was also a
 Zuntian would interact in the future.
 Han Jue’s other grandson, Heavenly Venerate
 Xun, had already returned. Now, he was obediently helping the Han family expand their territory.
 This kid had already awakened his memories
 of his previous life.
 His identity was one of the Ten Absolutes of the first Chaotic Assembly, Zhou Song’s Great
 Dao Heaven.
 Back in the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity, after seeing the power of Han Jue, Han Huang, and Han Ling, he had an idea.
 After that, he secretly entered the cycle of reincarnation. He himself had a perfected Great Dao Supreme cultivation. It was very difficult to sense his actions unless the other
 party was a Dao Creator.
 Heavenly Venerate Xun was shocked after he
 awakened Zhou Song’s Great Dao Heaven’s will. He never expected that he was Heavenly Venerate Xun.
 It was precisely because of this that he acted
 with his tail between his legs and did not
 betray the Han family. He realized that although the Great Dao Supreme Realm seemed to surpass all living beings, it could
 not escape the schemes of a Dao Creator.
 Han Jue had no objections to Zhou Song’s Great Dao Heaven. Most of the descendants of the Han family had identities from their previous lives. They didn’t care about Zhou
 decided.
 Whether the future would change was another
 matter.
 Han Jue looked at the others next. The people
 he cared about were all living happily and didn’t encounter any accidents. Han Huang had already condensed a second
 Supreme Rule, while the Dao Ancestor began to break through to the third. The difference between the two of them was increasing. This showed his understanding of the Dao.
 Although Han Huang’s potential far exceeded the Dao Ancestor’s, his understanding of the rules was far inferior. After all, the Dao
 Ancestor was once the number one person in
 the Chaos. Creating a lineage was not something Han Huang could catch up to with his potential.
 Han Jue didn’t mind this. After all, the two of
 them were good friends, although they rarely contacted each other.
 Han Jue retracted his gaze and rubbed his
 hands.
 “Divine Might Heavenly Sage, bless me. Give me a top-grade Creation Heaven’s Chosen,” Han Jue muttered to himself. The Creation
 Heaven’s Chosen came from the Ultimate
 before.
 Begin! [Activating the Creation Heaven’s Chosen. A random Great Creation will appear among your descendants.]
 [Your descendant Han Wang has awakened an Innate Great Creation-Heavenly Envy Ghost Star]
 [Your descendant Ru Daolong has awakened an Innate Great Creation-Superstar]
 [Your descendant Han Mo has awakened an Innate Great Creation-Mystic Heavenly Star]
 [Your son Han Tuo has awakened an Innate Great Creation-Primordial War God Star] [Your grandson Chu Xiaoqi has awakened an Innate Great Creation-Karma Dao Star]
 [Your daughter Han Qing’er has awakened an
 Innate Great Creation-Ten Thousand Sword Origin Star]
 [Your descendant Han Jue has awakened an Innate Great Creation-Floating Light Flood Star]
 [Your son Han Tuo has awakened an Innate
 Great Creation-Rule Fixed Star]
 …
 Information flashed in front of Han Jue.
 It only stopped after a hundred times.
 Han Tuo actually drew three Creation Heaven’s Chosen. So impressive. Han Qing’er and Han Yunjin had both awakened the Creation Heaven’s Chosen. Han Ling had another chance and accumulated
 two Creation Heaven’s Chosen like Han
 Huang.
 Chu Xiaoqi had drawn two Creation Heaven’s
 went to
 Chosen. The other Creation Heaven’s Chosen his descendants. There were no repeats, but there were descendants with the
 same name.
 Han Jue smiled in satisfaction. It seemed that the Creation Heaven’s Chosen could be accumulated continuously. Three times was definitely not the limit.
 It was also a good thing that his son benefited the most. After all, his descendants were far removed from him. It was troublesome to
 rope them in.
 Han Jue looked up. Han Tuo, Han Qing’er, Han Ling, Han Yunjin, and Chu Xiaoqi were
 all in an awakening state. They would be reborn.
 Han Huang fell behind. Perhaps this was fate.
 He had already taken advantage of the Creation Heaven’s Chosen and was ahead of the other clansmen.
 Han Jue stood up and walked out of the Daoist temple.
 He first went to find Xing Hongxuan. She was very happy to see him. After all, it
 had been five hundred million years.
 “Why were you in seclusion for so long? Aren’t you already invincible?” Xing
 Hongxuan curled her lips.
 She already felt bored and numb. Eternal life
 was no longer so beautiful.
 Now, she felt that everything had lost its
 meaning.
 Han Jue smiled. “I have to maintain
 invincibility. How can there be eternal
 invincibility?” Xing Hongxuan asked, “By the way, what do
 you
 think of the battle between the Dao Mystic Realm and Primordial Origin?” The Formless Transcendent Deity was the leader chosen by him. Primordial Origin was also a Primordial Fiendcelestial. Han Jue’s attitude was very important.
 “Let nature take its course. It doesn’t matter who wins. I can’t be bothered. Besides, there are even conflicts between children. How can I care about every one of them? Everyone has their own goals. There’s no need to be stubborn,” Han Jue chuckled and said casually.


 Xing Hongxuan felt that Han Jue’s words made sense, so she stopped thinking about this question. She changed the topic and voiced her doubts.
 She was very confused now and did not know what to do.
 Han Jue smiled and asked, “Do you remember when you met me?”
 Xing Hongxuan nodded. “Of course I remember. I’ll always remember it.”
 “Think about your original intention. There must be something in this world that can make you happy and satisfied. It’s just that you’ve forgotten, just like me. I’m still cultivating diligently because I like to cultivate,” Han Jue said.
 Xing Hongxuan pondered.
 Han Jue smiled and said, “Don’t think about it. Go back and take a look around.”
 With that, a black vortex appeared behind Xing Hongxuan and forcefully pulled her in. She passed through space and time and returned to the Jade Pure Sect.
 Outside the Jade Pure Sect.
 Xing Hongxuan landed on the mountain path. Her gaze landed on the herb garden ahead. The herb slaves were busy. She saw a small figure.
 Han Jue.
 Xing Hongxuan was stunned for a moment before she suddenly became interested.
 At this moment, she sensed an aura behind her and immediately hid. She saw a male and female cultivator walking side by side to the entrance of the herb garden.
 The female cultivator was the young Xing Hongxuan.
 Xing Hongxuan sighed as she looked at her past self.
 This was the turning point of fate.
 Her feelings appeared in her mind again. At that time, she was a spy of the Fiendish Cult and a double spy. She lived in fear.
 Xing Hongxuan paid attention to Han Jue for the next two years. As for herself, she was too familiar, so she couldn’t be bothered to care.
 She discovered that the young Han Jue was especially determined and kept a low profile, just like the invincible him.
 “Husband has really never changed.”
 Xing Hongxuan sighed in her heart. She shifted her attention to herself.
 It was time to look at herself from another angle and find out what she wanted to do.
 …
 Third Dao Field.
 Han Jue brought her back in less than two
 breaths, but to Xing Hongxuan it was ten thousand years.
 She had clearly returned in high spirits.
 “Thank you, husband!”
 Xing Hongxuan then walked out of her Daoist
 temple.
 Han Jue was helpless. Why did this girl suddenly feel younger and more energetic?
 He stood up and walked out of the Daoist temple to see Qingluan’er.
 Han Jue decided to go out for a walk after chatting with his Dao Companions.
 He wanted to see how a hundred Creation Heaven’s Chosen would affect the Endless
 Era.
 Han Tuo, Han Ling, Han Qing’er, and Han Yunjin were very excited, but they needed time to control the newly awakened Great Creation.
 Han Jue’s gaze landed on his descendants. The Great Creation affected them the most. It could be said that their fate had directly transformed.
 Han Jue split into dozens of clones and contacted his descendants one by one, letting them embark on the path of cultivation.
 At the edge of the Dao Mystic Realm. Architectural Dharma treasures surrounded a huge beast. This huge beast was like a dragon
 turtle, and there was a palace on its back. In the palace, Chu Xiaoqi was enjoying the transformation brought by the Karma Dao
 Star.
 “I was indeed born extraordinary. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have been recognized by Grandpa.”
 Chu Xiaoqi was secretly pleased. Not long ago, he had returned from the battlefield in failure and was severely injured. He did not expect his talent to be awakened. He was extremely
 happy.
 When he grasped this new power, he would
 definitely be able to kill everyone. Perhaps the burden of defeating Primordial Origin would fall on his shoulders. The more he thought about it, the more excited he became.
 A man rushed into the hall at this moment.
 “Grandpa, something bad has happened. Senior Chen Jue was captured by Primordial Origin!”
 Chu Xiaoqi opened his eyes and frowned. “What did the Realm Lord say?”
 The man replied, “The Realm Lord is gathering experts, including you. He wants to attack Primordial Origin’s position again.” “Hurry up and prepare!”
 Chu Xiaoqi said in a low voice, “No, I have to
 so easily.”
 The man was stunned. He could only accept the order and leave.
 Chu Xiaoqi took a deep breath and closed his eyes again.
 “He might not be able to last that long.”
 A laugh suddenly sounded, startling Chu Xiaoqi so much that he opened his eyes. He
 turned around and saw Han Jue walking out of the darkness.
 Chu Xiaoqi was stunned as if he was struck by lightning.
 Han Jue didn’t show his divine light and revealed his true body. As he walked over, he
 smiled and said, “What? You don’t recognize me? It seems that I’ve raised an ingrate.” Chu Xiaoqi woke up and hurriedly knelt down.
 He said with a trembling voice, “Grandpa! Why are you…”
 The blurry figure in his memories became
 clear again. He had imagined the reunion countless times, but he did not expect it to be so sudden.
 Han Jue sat down in front of him and smiled. “Why am I still alive?”
 “Of course not. You must be alive. I’ve always felt that you’re very powerful…” Chu Xiaoqi said incoherently. He had not been so excited for a long time.
 He had been investigating Han Jue’s traces after he became stronger. Unfortunately, his efforts were fruitless.
 He had once asked Formless World about the
 Dao Creator, but he was stopped. He said not to ask about the Dao Creator. That would result in unimaginable consequences. Even Formless World couldn’t stop him.
 “Grandpa, I…” Chu Xiaoqi looked at Han Jue
 with all sorts of questions in his heart. He opened his mouth but didn’t know what to say.
 Han Jue smiled and asked, “Didn’t you hear
 what I said just now? Don’t you care about
 your brother?”
 Chu Xiaoqi came back to his senses. “Grandpa, will Chen Jue die?” “Yes, Primordial Origin has ulterior motives
 for capturing him.”
 “What should I do? Can you save him?”
 “What’s his relationship with me? Why should I save him?”
 Han Jue laughed as if he had heard a joke. Chu Xiaoqi blushed and felt ashamed.
 How could he make such a request? “He’s not worthy of being my grandson. As
 for saving him, go find your master. You still don’t know your master’s identity, right? There are three Primordial Fiendcelestials in the Endless Era. Your master is one of them.”
 Han Jue’s words shocked Chu Xiaoqi. Primordial Fiendcelestial? Impossible!
 He instantly thought of many possibilities. Could it be that he had been plotted against?
 “I don’t know where to find him. I’ve
 awakened
 walk around the Dao Mystic Realm. You can look for me if you need me.”
 With that, Han Jue disappeared. Chu Xiaoqi was stunned. With his cultivation, he actually couldn’t
 capture Han Jue’s aura at all. He was shocked.
 His thoughts went to Huang Zuntian again. Three Primordial Fiendcelestials… What was their relationship?


 In the vast purple starry sky.
 Countless Primordial Purple Qi filled the air. This was the Primordial Origin.
 The three Primordial Chaos were called Desolate Primordial Chaos, Primordial Origin, and Life Primordial Chaos.
 They were all named after their own creators’ names or creations.
 Primordial Origin stood in the Primordial Void as his main body. Endless purple Qi coiled around his body, causing his majestic figure to look extremely terrifying.
 Primordial Origin opened his eyes and then opened his right hand. A person appeared in his palm. It was Chen Jue.
 Chen Jue was sealed. His body was curled up and his will did not awaken.
 Primordial Origin frowned and looked down at him. He muttered, “Strange, what’s hidden in your body? Even I can’t steal this creation.”
 He had targeted Chen Jue. On the battlefield, Chen Jue’s strength left a deep impression on him. Later, he discovered that Chen Jue’s strength was not only because of his potential but because of a fortuitous encounter. Therefore, he tried his best to capture him.
 However, he couldn’t seize this opportunity. He stared at Chen Jue, his eyes emitting a strange light as if he wanted to see through his soul.
 After a long while…
 Primordial Origin trembled.
 He retracted his hand. Chen Jue floated in the void, his body emitting a dazzling fire light.
 The defensive power of creation!
 Primordial Origin was even more curious. What kind of fortuitous encounter was this? It could actually devour his power. One had to know that he was about to condense the first Supreme Rule. Only less than five existences were stronger than him in the entire Endless Era.
 Could it be a Dao Creator?
 Impossible!
 There was no such creation in Formless World.
 Perhaps it was a new product of the Endless Era.
 He adjusted his state of mind and stopped trying to snatch Chen Jue’s creation.
 He would see when he condensed the first Supreme Rule.
 Primordial Origin seemed to sense something at this moment. He waved his hand and Chen Jue disappeared.
 A figure tore through the void and arrived.
 It was Huang Zuntian.
 Primordial Origin asked, “Why are you here?”
 Huang Zuntian said, “It’s not only me.”
 With that, the void tore apart again and the
 majestic Han Huang walked out.
 Primordial Origin’s expression became subtle as he saw him.
 Chen Jue had the Han family’s bloodline. He could deduce this.
 However, the Han family had countless and even more outstanding descendants. Chen Jue did not have much interaction with the Han
 family.
 “What is it?” Primordial Origin asked calmly.
 Primordial Origin and Huang Zuntian looked at him, waiting for him to continue. “The Endless Era is so big. Be it me or you,
 it’s impossible for one of us to dominate the Endless Era. More and more Dao Creators will appear in the future. I feel that the three Primordial Chaos can be fused. From now on, we will live and die together. If more Primordial Fiendcelestials are born in the
 future, they will have to rely on us,” Han Huang said calmly, causing Primordial Origin
 to frown.
 Han Huang to persuade him.
 The benefit of fusing was that they would join
 forces from now on. At least, they could rely on each other. The downside was that they would not be able to separate in the future. Of course, all of this had to be based on Han Huang’s sincere desire to cooperate. With Primordial Origin’s understanding of him, this kid was only domineering, but he
 was not that scheming.
 Most importantly, it was the person behind Han Huang.
 Primordial Origin asked, “Who will be the
 master?”
 Han Huang shook his head and laughed. “There’s no need to prioritize. Let our Primordial Chaos fuse and let karma and fate fuse. I can hand the Primordial Chaos to you
 if you like power and know how to govern.”
 Huang Zuntian smiled. “I want to cultivate.” Primordial Origin smiled. “In that case, I have no objections. How can we fuse the Primordial Chaos?”
 Han Huang began to describe his idea. Primordial Origin and Huang Zuntian felt that
 it was feasible, but this method was needed.
 Before leaving, Primordial Origin handed Chen Jue over and wanted to ask Han Huang about his attitude.
 for two forces to fight and be captured as long as you don’t implicate the innocent.” Primordial Origin smiled. “Since you’re so sincere, I’ll let him go. This child has a mysterious creation. His future achievements are immeasurable.”
 “Such a descendant is nothing in the Han
 family.”
 Han Huang disappeared after saying that.
 Huang Zuntian added, “This child is my disciple’s brother. You’re holding the line that connects two people.”
 Primordial Origin threw Chen Jue to him and
 smiled. “In that case, I’ll give you the favor.”
 “I won’t thank you.”
 Huang Zuntian took Chen Jue and left the Primordial Chaos.
 Primordial Origin smiled and closed his eyes
 to cultivate.
 Under the blue sky and white clouds, in the high-wall courtyard.
 A handsome man was practicing martial arts.
 Han Jue sat on the steps in front of the hall
 and yawned.
 The handsome man stopped and came in
 front of him. He chuckled and said, “Grandpa, how’s my fist technique just now?” Han Jue curled his lips. “What a waste of
 talent. Cultivate. There’s no future in practicing martial arts.”
 The handsome man’s name was Ru Daolong.
 He had awakened an Innate Great Creation, Superstar.
 The Superstar was born with great opportunities. He would surpass his limits
 every time he was on the verge of death. If he
 immortal world, not cultivation. There were no legends of cultivators here, but Han Jue
 knew that those legendary terrifying martial artists were cultivators.
 He had found Ru Daolong seven years ago.
 The two of them were master and disciple,
 but Ru Daolong had yet to truly develop the potential of the Superstar.
 Ru Daolong curled his lips. “What cultivation?
 I’ve never heard of it.”
 A group of servants rushed in at this moment. The thin man in the lead wailed, “Young Master, the neighboring village is bullying us again!”
 Ru Daolong’s eyes widened like leopard eyes.
 He said angrily, “They’re courting death! Let’s go!” Han Jue lay down and continued to bask in the sun as Ru Daolong left in a hurry. “Kid, this current life won’t last long.” Han Jue chuckled. No one heard him. He was talking to himself. It was his habit. Ru Daolong’s family background was considered big among mortals, but Han Jue saw two Immortal Emperors fighting. They were getting closer and closer to this world.
 Their fight would affect this world sooner or
 later. At that time, the end of the world would arrive. Han Jue couldn’t be bothered to remind Ru Daolong. He still had dozens of such descendants. He was just bored and came out to play with them.
 Ru Daolong’s personality was truly a perfect
 match for the Superstar Great Creation. With such a fiery temper, he would definitely encounter many desperate situations in the
 future. However, he would definitely die if he did not have a backer.
 There were also examples of descendants with Innate Great Creation dying, but the Innate Great Creation could reincarnate with their descendants.


 The first few decades Ru Daolong met Han Jue was smooth sailing. He married and had children. He went from childish to mature and took on the responsibility of the village.
 As time passed, Ru Daolong’s heart changed because Han Jue didn’t age.
 The legend of Han Jue’s youth spread over a radius of ten thousand miles, attracting many children to acknowledge him as their master. Han Jue didn’t refuse, but he didn’t really teach them anything. Every day, he would wander around the village with a group of brats.
 Ru Daolong wanted to seek cultivation techniques from Han Jue again, but he was vague. Just like that, the trivial matters of the family made Ru Daolong forget his original intention.
 Sixty years later.
 He was no longer as lively as when he was young. After dealing with his family matters, he looked at the sky in a daze most of the time.
 On this day.
 He found Han Jue and chatted.
 Han Jue smiled. “I just look young. Actually, I’m old too. I can’t remember many things from the past.
 Ru Daolong sighed.
 “Unfortunately, my potential is not outstanding enough. Otherwise, I could have gone out to adventure in the martial arts world when I was young.” Ru Daolong sighed. When one was old, they liked to reminisce on their youth.
 Han Jue smiled and asked, “How high do you think the sky is?”
 Han Jue smiled.
 “However, your words make me very curious. How high is the sky? People often say that if the sky collapses, the sky will collapse. However, when has the sky ever collapsed? Only people who can’t withstand age will collapse.”
 Ru Daolong looked at the sky and began to fall into a daze.
 Han Jue stretched lazily and smiled. “The sky is about to collapse.”
 Ru Daolong thought that it was a joke, so he did not reply.
 Not long after, he suddenly saw a point of
 light appear in the sky. It quickly expanded and streaked across the sky, causing the entire world to lose its color. He was so shocked that he subconsciously closed his
 eyes.
 Before he could react, he heard a deafening boom.
 He suddenly recalled Han Jue’s words.
 The sky was about to collapse…
 …
 After a certain period of time.
 Ru Daolong felt pain all over his body when
 he woke up. He saw the torn crimson sky after he opened his eyes. The countless black cracks were like centipedes. It was terrifying. Dust filled his eyes, making him even dizzier. What happened?
 Dong- Dong- Dong-
 His heart beat faster and louder. His mind
 went blank and he felt like his body was about
 to explode!
 He suddenly saw two figures confronting each other in the sky.
 He rubbed his eyes with difficulty to confirm that he was not seeing things.
 How could a person stop so high in the sky?
 Ru Daolong was terrified. Despair, anger, and fear filled him, causing him to be in a daze and not know what to do.
 He couldn’t accept what he saw and had a
 trace of hope.
 Could all of this be a dream?
 A familiar voice sounded. Ru Daolong turned around and discovered Han Jue standing on a beam in the ruins. That figure was straight and his robes fluttered. Ru Daolong was shocked. He had never seen Han Jue with such
 a temperament.
 The setting sun was like blood as it stood in the world. That bearing shocked him. He came back to his senses and asked with a
 trembling voice, “Grandpa, what… do you mean?”
 Han Jue turned around and looked down at
 him. He smiled and said, “I asked you to cultivate in the past, but you didn’t like it. Now, do you see how powerful cultivators are?”
 Cultivator?
 Ru Daolong suddenly woke up. His body
 trembled as he looked up at the sky angrily. He gritted his teeth and asked, “Is all of this done by cultivators?”
 Han Jue smiled and didn’t say anything.
 Ru Daolong suddenly thought of something. He looked at Han Jue and asked, “You’re also
 a cultivator? Why aren’t you protecting
 them?”
 “Can you live if I don’t make a move?”
 “Then why don’t you protect them…” “Are they related to me?” Han Jue interrupted him and asked coldly.
 His expression became unprecedentedly cold, causing Ru Daolong to panic. “I came to you
 only for you. All these years, I didn’t owe your village anything. You will definitely die if I leave today.”
 Ru Daolong lowered his head and grabbed the
 stone beside him with both hands. He grabbed until his fingernails were about to overturn and blood overflowed. Han Jue stared at him and said, “I know
 you’re angry now, but you will naturally understand all of this when you embark on the path of cultivation. As for whether you
 want revenge, that’s your business. I’ll leave those two for you to deal with. “Daolong, it’s time for me to leave. You
 should walk your own path from now on. Aren’t you regretting your lack of drive when you were young? Now, you have to start over. Such an opportunity depends on whether you can grasp it. I taught you a cultivation technique, but you delayed it for fifty years. You might have been able to save them if you had learned it back then.”
 Han Jue waved his right hand, and a memory entered Ru Daolong’s mind. Ru Daolong fell asleep.
 …
 In a void in the Dao Mystic Realm.
 Two figures kept crossing paths. All sorts of
 Mystical Powers changed unpredictably and collided. They were Chen Jue and Chu Xiaoqi. Chu Xiaoqi laughed wantonly. “Feel my
 karma power?”
 Chen Jue’s lower body was condensing again. He exclaimed, “It’s indeed powerful. It’s even stronger than Primordial Origin’s Karma
 Mystical Power. I didn’t expect you to have such talent.”
 Chu Xiaoqi flew in front of him and retracted
 the power of karma. He smiled proudly and said, “Of course. Otherwise, why would my grandfather take a liking to me back then? By way, my grandfather is in the Dao Mystic Realm. Do you want to see him?”
 the
 Chen Jue shook his head. “Why should I see your grandpa?”
 “My grandfather is very powerful!”
 “I’ve seen many powerful people. You and I are also considered powerful.” “My grandfather is different.” “Oh? He’s a Dao Creator?” “Perhaps not, but perhaps yes? Do you really
 not want to meet him? This might be your greatest opportunity!” Chu Xiaoqi said proudly, making Chen Jue silent.
 What if?
 Thinking of Chu Xiaoqi’s opportunities, his
 potential was clearly not monstrous, but he always followed closely behind him.
 Chu Xiaoqi smiled and said, “Let’s go. We can rest.”
 Chen Jue did not refuse anymore. The two of them immediately left the void
 and entered the mortal world at the bottom of
 the Dao Mystic Realm.
 Han Jue specially opened a back door for Chu Xiaoqi. Only he could capture his aura. At this moment, Han Jue was fishing in the
 mountains when Chu Xiaoqi and Chen Jue appeared beside him. “Grandpa!”
 Chu Xiaoqi came over and giggled. He
 returned to his youthful personality in front of Han Jue.
 Chen Jue stared at Han Jue in shock. He couldn’t see through the other party’s cultivation at all!
