 Han Jue frowned. He had seen the Divine Authority Generals in the illusion before. They didn‚Äôt have a leader or independent thoughts. They looked like fighting machines.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure either, but I did find the Dao Ancestor among the Divine Authority Generals. This matter is really strange. I have to think of a way to investigate.‚Äù
 Han Jue nodded and noted this down.
 The two of them chatted for a while more before Han Jue removed the dream.
 He opened his eyes and asked in his mind, ‚ÄúI want to know why the Dao Ancestor is among the Divine Authority Generals?‚Äù
 [It cannot be deduced without karma.]
 What did it mean by no karma?
 Han Jue began to ask all sorts of questions about the Dao Ancestor, but no matter how he asked, he couldn‚Äôt derive them.
  It was as if the Dao Ancestor did not exist!
 This was interesting.
 The Dao Ancestor was clearly still in his interpersonal relationships. How could he not have deduced it?
 It seemed that the Dao Ancestor had not been idle during this period of time. He had been secretly working hard.
 ......
 Han Jue shook his head and stopped thinking about it.
 Then, he entered cultivation again.
 The Fiendcelestials were gathered in the hall in the Grand Primordium Domain.
 Beside the Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial sat a burly figure. It was Pangu.
 Pangu‚Äôs hair was disheveled and he emitted a wild aura. As he breathed, it was like turbid flames spitting out.
 At this moment, Pangu suddenly opened his eyes.
 The other Fiendcelestials seemed to sense something and opened their eyes with solemn expressions.
 The other Fiendcelestials began to speak.
 ‚ÄúWhy did they suddenly turn to the Grand Primordium Domain?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúIndeed, a mysterious existence is manipulating the Divine Authority Generals. They‚Äôre just afraid that we Chaotic Fiendcelestials will grow stronger.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúUnfortunately, I wanted to rope in some mighty figures.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúThere are always people afraid of death. The Chaos will be under our control in the future if we win this battle!‚Äù
 The Chaotic Fiendcelestials were all high-spirited and fearless.
 They were already mentally prepared. Before the battle, they naturally would not dampen each other‚Äôs morale.
 Most importantly, they had no way out!
 Pangu said, ‚ÄúPrepare to set up the formation.‚Äù
 The Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial nodded and stood up.
 An ancient battle that was rare in billions of years was about to erupt!
 Heavenly Dao.
 Time flew.
 Han Jue continued to cultivate without stopping after he entered seclusion for fifty thousand years.
 In any case, the Heavenly Dao‚Äôs development was smooth sailing. Great Dao Sages and Great Dao Supremes were also guarding it. Only the Divine Authority could cause trouble in the future.
 After a certain period of time.
 Han Jue suddenly sensed something and opened his eyes.
 He felt a huge battle erupt in the chaos!
 He calmed down and calculated. It had only been a little more than 90,000 years since he entered seclusion. Had the Divine Authority Generals already reached the Grand Primordium Domain?
 It was a little fast!
 In other words, the Heavenly Dao‚Äôs future would also be brought forward!
 Han Jue took a deep breath. He was already prepared to fight and was not afraid.
 He looked at the Grand Primordium Domain. The dozens of Chaotic Fiendcelestials were already surrounded by ten thousand Divine Authority Generals. Outside the battlefield, the twelve Ancestral Magi brought the Magus Race over, but they did not dare to go up.
 It was not only the Magus Race. Other races were watching the battle and preparing to attack at any time. They were probably related to the Chaotic Fiendcelestials.
 The battle was intense. Pangu was the most eye-catching. He fought a thousand Divine Authority Generals alone and was not at all inferior.
 After a Divine Authority General was destroyed, he instantly revived as if he could not be killed.
 He couldn‚Äôt see who would win for the time
 being.
 However, Han Jue felt that the Divine Authority Generals would win.
 Apart from the Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial and Pangu, the other Fiendcelestials were not as powerful as the Foolish Sword Sage. Most Chaotic Fiendcelestials would find it difficult to fight a Divine Authority General alone.
 The undying Divine Authority Generals would win sooner or later.
 Han Jue watched with relish.
 This battle wouldn‚Äôt end anytime soon. After watching for a while, Han Jue lost interest.
 ‚ÄúHow long until the Divine Authority Generals reach the Heavenly Dao?‚Äù he asked in his mind.
 (1 quadrillion years will be deducted. Do you want to continue?)
 Continue!
 (500,000 years]
 Han Jue knew that this was the latest forecast. The actual time would only speed up.
 He could affect the development of karma, and so could others, let alone existences stronger than him.
 Come on!
 I‚Äôll be waiting for you!
 Han Jue thought proudly.
 It was time to test his strength after secretly cultivating for three million years!
 Han Jue sent a voice transmission to Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du, asking him to prepare early to prevent chaos.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du immediately gathered the Sages.
 After Sect Master Tian Jue left, the Foolish Sword Sage opened his eyes and stared at the chaos, watching from afar.
 The Divine Authority Generals‚Äô power made him uneasy.
 Pangu was already his mental demon. But even such a powerful mental demon was suppressed by the Divine Authority Generals.
 The Foolish Sword Sage had mixed emotions. He was both terrified and glad.
 The Divine Authority Generals seemed to be proficient in some kind of restriction that sealed the Grand Primordium Domain. Some Chaotic Fiendcelestials who had been killed wanted to escape, but they were blocked.
 Dead end!
 A Chaotic Fiendcelestial had already died.
 The Foolish Sword Sage stopped watching and looked at the Immortal World. What was Han Jue thinking now?
 Should he visit him in his dreams?
 No!
 Han Jue must already know that the battle has erupted. Won‚Äôt I look timid if I go looking for him?
 The Foolish Sword Sage adjusted his state of mind, and his eyes were filled with fighting spirit again.
 ‚ÄúSo what if there are ten thousand Divine Authority Generals?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúMy Sword Dao will use you as a whetstone!‚Äù
 The Foolish Sword Sage‚Äôs eyes flickered as he became high-spirited again.
 Thousands of years later, Han Jue was still cultivating when a choice suddenly appeared in front of him.
 [Detected that the Divine Authority Generals are about to attack the Heavenly Dao. You have the following choices:]
 (1: Prepare to fight the Divine Authority Generals. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment, a Creation Spirit Stone, a Primordial Fragment, and a Supreme Treasure.)
 [2: Immediately escape the Heavenly Dao and stay away from trouble. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment and a Creation Spirit Stone.]
 Han Jue chose the first one without hesitation after looking at the choices in front of him.
 It was rare to choose the first option!
  (You chose to fight the Divine Authority Generals and obtained a Great Dao Fragment, a Creation Spirit Stone, a Primordial Fragment, and a Supreme Treasure.)
 (Congratulations on obtaining the Ultimate Dao Treasure-Ultimate Mortal Robe]
 [Ultimate Mortal Robe: Ultimate Defensive Dao Treasure. A Supreme Treasure formed by absorbing mortal power. It is invisible and colorless. It can defend against a blow from a Dao Creator.)
 Han Jue‚Äôs eyes widened and his breathing quickened.
 It could defend against a blow from a Dao Creator!
 Although it was only one strike, it was enough to make Han Jue excited!
 How safe!
 The system was truly caring!
 Han Jue first took out the Creation Spirit Stone and fused it with a ball of Fiendcelestial Qi. Then, he took out the Ultimate Mortal Robe and refined it to recognize him as its owner.
 The Ultimate Mortal Robe was a ball of red Qi in Han Jue‚Äôs hand. It didn‚Äôt look like a robe in the slightest.


 Han Jue finally succeeded after five hundred years.
 Something pleasantly surprising happened again. The Ultimate Mortal Robe directly dissipated and turned invisible. It attached to his body, and he didn‚Äôt even need to take off the Time Dao Robe.
 In other words, he was wearing two robe Dharma treasures at once. It was simply too defensive!
 Impeccable!
 Perfect!
 Han Jue was full of confidence now.
 He immediately began the simulation trial and challenged ten thousand Great Dao Supreme Foolish Sword Sage.
 He stood still and let them hit him.
 They finally shattered the Ultimate Mortal Robe after five minutes.
  It was stable.
 Han Jue could finally rest assured.
 He closed his eyes and continued cultivating.
 ......
 Chaotic Fiendcelestial!
 All living grew up listening to the legends of the Chaotic Fiendcelestials. Fiendcelestials were the highest existences in the hearts of all living beings.
 The Divine Authority Generals had actually annihilated most of the Chaotic Fiendcelestials in one battle!
 For a time, the entire Chaos fell into an uproar.
 After the shock, most of the living beings reacted with excitement. After all, the Divine Authority Generals could not threaten them.
 All living beings in the Chaos would have a chance to rise once the Chaotic Fiendcelestials were cleaned up!
 A Chaotic Fiendcelestial could control a domain. Once it died, the forces and power it affected would be immeasurable.
 At the same time, the gazes of the Chaotic living beings landed on the Heavenly Dao.
Diiscover new ùíîtories at nùíêve/lbin(.)c/oùíé The Chaotic Fiendcelestials were dead. Next was the Heavenly Dao.
 All the living beings in the Immortal World also learned about this when the news reached the Heavenly Dao. They were in danger.
 In the Universal Hall.
 Sages gathered. Even the Sages of the Hidden Sect came.
 Everyone was talking about the battle in the Grand Primordium Domain.
 ‚ÄúI really didn‚Äôt expect them to all die. Even Pangu died.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúSigh, it‚Äôs almost our turn.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt say it. I‚Äôm suddenly nervous.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúWhat are you afraid of? Isn‚Äôt this good? The Chaotic Fiendcelestials have failed. How impressive will that be if we win?‚Äù
 They had guessed that the Chaotic Fiendcelestials would lose, but they did not expect them to all die.
 None of them survived!
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, ‚ÄúThe Chaotic Heavenly Road will be temporarily closed. Only the Heavenly Dao lifeforms are allowed to return. You are not allowed to leave.‚Äù
 Pan Xin and Jin Shen nodded.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du continued to deploy. Every Sage had arranged things in an orderly manner. His steadiness also calmed the Sages.
 They could only choose to believe in the Divine Might Heavenly Sage.
 Han Jue entered seclusion for another fifty thousand years. Then, he opened his eyes and came to the second Dao Field. He released the new Fiendcelestial and let Murong Qi take it away.
 Dao Comprehension Sword asked, ‚ÄúMaster, the Divine Authority Generals are about to attack. Are you confident?‚Äù
 Li Yao also looked at him.
 Han Jue said, ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù ‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù
 Dao Comprehension Sword panicked. ‚ÄúThen let‚Äôs run!‚Äù
 Han Jue smiled faintly.
 Li Yao said helplessly, ‚ÄúWould Sect Master need your reminder if he was really not confident?‚Äù
 Dao Comprehension Sword was enlightened.
 Han Jue said, ‚ÄúCultivate in peace. The Divine Authority Generals will definitely not be our last enemy. There might be stronger enemies in the future. I need your help with the next calamities. You can‚Äôt rely on me to do everything personally, right?‚Äù
 Li Yao nodded.
 Dao Comprehension Sword was ashamed.
 Speaking of which, these Hidden Sect disciples had never helped him resolve his problems.
 Han Jue chatted with them for a while before returning to the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 He looked at the Chaos next.
 cre
 From the point of view of the Chaos, the ten thousand Divine Authority Generals were advancing towards the Heavenly Dao in a straight line.
 Although Han Jue was already prepared, he still became a little nervous.
 He had lived for more than three million years, but he rarely encountered such a battle.
 Excitement!
 Anticipation!
 Nervousness!
 He was also a little scared!
 Han Jue asked in his mind, ‚ÄúWill I die if I kill ten thousand Divine Authority Generals?‚Äù
 (1 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [No]
 Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief.
 He asked, ‚ÄúWill the Chaotic Deities personally take action if I kill ten thousand Divine Authority Generals?‚Äù [1 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?)
 Continue!
 (No]
 The Chaotic Deities wouldn‚Äôt attack even after this?
 Were they cowards?
 Something was wrong.
 ‚ÄúWhy won‚Äôt the Chaotic Deities take action after I kill ten thousand Divine Authority Generals?‚Äù
 (1 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 (A mysterious existence is restraining them.]
 Han Jue narrowed his eyes.
 It was either Pangu, the Dao Ancestor, or the two of them working together.
 Actually, he was not afraid even if the Chaotic Deities attacked.
 At most, he would hide in the Dao Field.
 Han Jue continued to stare at the Chaos.
 Indeed.
 The Divine Authority Generals‚Äô speed was increasing!
 Faster and faster!
 Han Jue stood up and jumped out of the Heavenly Dao with Great Sage Void Soul. He came to the 33rd Heaven and directly entered the Universal Hall.
 Great Sage Void Soul was nervous. He knew why Han Jue brought him out.
 He had also spied on the Chaos before and witnessed the Divine Authority Generals‚Äô dominance.
 ‚ÄúBoss, why did you bring me here? I‚Äôm nothing‚Ä¶‚Äù
 Great Sage Void Soul was sad, but he did not dare to say it.
  The last time the Divine Robe Daoist attacked, he had lost all his face and had been looking for a chance to regain it.
 Why was this happening? Great Sage Void Soul felt that a mighty figure was targeting him.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du immediately stood up when he saw Han Jue.
 He would not do that in the past. It could be seen how much pressure he was under.
 Although he was usually calm, he was actually under the greatest pressure. He had to support the overall situation of the Heavenly Dao and not collapse.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du asked carefully, ‚ÄúFellow Daoist Han, what‚Äôs the matter?‚Äù
 He was very nervous, afraid that Han Jue would say that he couldn‚Äôt win and wanted to escape.
 In that case, how could he face the living beings of the Heavenly Dao and the other Sages?


 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du immediately followed upon hearing Han Jue‚Äôs instructions.
 Soon, the Sages arrived one after another. They all came without missing a single one.
 At this juncture, the Sages did not dare to leave the Heavenly Dao, afraid that they would encounter the Divine Authority Generals. They could not cultivate in peace and felt uneasy.
 The Sages sat down and looked at Han Jue. The uneasiness in their hearts immediately vanished.
 Han Jue was still here, so hope was still there!
 Han Jue closed his eyes and didn‚Äôt say anything.
 The atmosphere was oppressive. No one dared to speak.
 It was the same for Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du.
  Great Sage Void Soul scanned all the Sages in the hall and secretly despised them.
 Why are you so nervous? You‚Äôre not the ones fighting!
 A group of Heavenly Dao Sages and Freedom Sages were not even qualified to participate!
 ......
 Wouldn‚Äôt they turn into dust when the Divine Authority Generals glared?
 ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be nervous. You can chat amongst yourselves. We‚Äôll wait for the Divine Authority Generals to arrive.‚Äù
 Han Jue‚Äôs voice sounded. The Sages immediately felt relieved.
 Long Hao, Dao Sovereign, and the other Hidden Sect disciples were the most relaxed. They were the first to speak, and the atmosphere soon became lively.
 ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right. Those Chaotic Fiendcelestials are really useless. They lost too quickly.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúIt still depends on my master!‚Äù
 ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt panic. I was still preaching just now.‚Äù
 right?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúNo, they‚Äôre almost here. The Divine Authority Generals are not as simple as the rules. They clearly received the order and directly came to the Heavenly Dao. They can‚Äôt wait any longer. Monitoring the Chaos is only a pretense. The focus is still to eliminate the Chaotic Fiendcelestials and the Heavenly Dao.‚Äù
 The Sages discussed and the atmosphere became relaxed.
 Han Jue waited patiently.
 (Foolish Sword Sage sent you a dream. Do you accept?]
 Couldn‚Äôt he just send a voice transmission?
 He was clearly beside the Heavenly Dao!
 He hesitated for a moment but still chose to accept the dream.
 Han Jue said, ‚ÄúI know.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou‚Ä¶‚Äù
 ‚ÄúAre you afraid?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not! It‚Äôs impossible!‚Äù
 ‚ÄúFellow Daoist Red Fate didn‚Äôt visit me in my dreams.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just reminding you. How can I be afraid?‚Äù
 The Foolish Sword Sage snorted and removed the dream.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and found it interesting
 He did not expect the Foolish Sword Sage to have such a side.
 But it made sense on second thought. Pangu was already dead. How could the Foolish Sword Sage not be afraid?
 Time passed.
 It was impossible for the Divine Authority Generals to arrive in a few years no matter how fast they were. Not long after, the Universal Hall fell silent and the Sages cultivated separately.
 In the Dark Forbidden Zone, a strong light shone from the depths of the darkness. The strong light quickly stretched out like a beam of light.
 Looking closer, terrifying figures ten million feet tall could be seen in the strong light. All of them were mighty and domineering. They walked side by side and were unstoppable.
 Divine Authority Generals!
 The Chaotic Heavenly Road happened to be ahead of them.
 The Chaotic Heavenly Road stretched through the void, with no end in sight.
 At this moment, several cultivators were hurrying along the Chaotic Heavenly Road.
 They subconsciously narrowed their eyes when they saw the strong light in the distance.
 ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that?‚Äù a woman frowned and asked.
 A green-robed Daoist beside her had a drastic change in expression. ‚ÄúOh no! It‚Äôs the Divine Authority Generals! There‚Äôs someone in the strong light! Run! Return to the Heavenly Dao!‚Äù
 With that, he was the first to leap and speed through the Chaotic Heavenly Road.
 The other cultivators reacted and hurriedly followed.
 They did not dare to leave the Chaotic Heavenly Road. After all, they had heard rumors that the Divine Authority Generals would slaughter the Heavenly Dao lifeforms.
 0
 The ten thousand Divine Authority Generals arrived in front of the Chaotic Heavenly Road in less than ten steps. The ten-thousand-foot-wide Chaotic Heavenly Road was like a thin line in front of them.
 The Divine Authority Generals stepped on the Chaotic Heavenly Road together, instantly shattering it. The living beings on the Heavenly Road were destroyed, no matter how far they were from the Divine Authority Generals.
 Many cultivators had not even seen the Divine Authority Generals. Their deaths were too sudden and confusing.
 At the edge of the Heavenly Dao, the nearby Chaotic City shook because of the collapse of the Chaotic Heavenly Road, startling countless cultivators. Even the Sages were alarmed.
 ‚ÄúDog!‚Äù
 Pan Xin gritted his teeth and deduced who had attacked the Chaotic Heavenly Road.
 Although he cursed, he did not stand up.
 He knew his limits. He was not a Divine Authority General‚Äôs match.
 Han Jue slowly opened his eyes.
 His eyes were cold and murderous.
 It had to be said that the Divine Authority Generals‚Äô actions made him very unhappy.
 It was unknown if it was a coincidence or on purpose!
 The Chaotic Heavenly Road that the Heavenly Dao had built for two million years was gone just like that. It was even crushed!
 The other Sages counted with their fingers. They were furious after understanding the situation.
 ‚ÄúToo arrogant!‚Äù Zhou Fan said angrily. This was not stepping on the Chaotic Heavenly Road but on the Heavenly Dao‚Äôs dignity.
 The other Sages denounced.
 Han Jue looked at the Chaos.
 The Divine Authority Generals were so fast!
 As if provoked, they suddenly accelerated. Ten thousand Divine Authority Generals surged over. Every step shook the Dark Forbidden Zone. The dark space twisted as if it would shatter at any moment.
 The Heavenly Dao Sages could already sense the Divine Authority Generals‚Äô aura in less than ten minutes.
 (Pangu sent you a dream. Do you accept?]
 Han Jue showed a frown.
 At this time?
 He immediately accepted it, wanting to see what Pangu had to say.
 The dream was on Buzhou Divine Mountain.
 ‚ÄúYou only need to deal with the Divine Authority Generals and survive this calamity first!‚Äù
 ‚ÄúAlright!‚Äù
 Han Jue directly removed the dream and didn‚Äôt say anything else, lest the Divine Authority Generals take advantage of his distraction to shatter the Heavenly Dao.
 He opened his eyes and discovered that all the Sages were staring at him.
 The Foolish Sword Sage and Red Fate had already appeared outside the Heavenly Dao and were looking into the darkness.
 ‚ÄúFellow Daoist Red Fate, are you afraid?‚Äù the Foolish Sword Sage asked with a smile, pretending to be relaxed.
 Red Fate said, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs there to be afraid of? At most, we‚Äôll die.‚Äù
 Wasn‚Äôt this woman famous for being afraid of death? Why was she so determined?
 He was secretly curious. What did Han Jue do to her?
  At this moment, Han Jue‚Äôs voice floated into their ears.
 ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt attack later. You are responsible for watching the battle.‚Äù
 The Foolish Sword Sage was stunned.
 Responsible for watching the battle?
 What did this mean?
 In the end, he did not need to do anything?
 Although he was puzzled, the Foolish Sword Sage heaved a sigh of relief.
 He was really not confident.
 The Pangu he was afraid of had been killed by the Divine Authority Generals. How could he not be afraid?


 In the blink of an eye, he appeared in front of the ten thousand Divine Authority Generals. He instantly used the simulation trial to copy their cultivation levels and disappeared.
 The entire process was too fast, so fast that Han Jue seemed to have never appeared.
 The other Sages did not notice his disappearance.
 Han Jue predicted that it would take at least five minutes for the Divine Authority Generals to arrive.
 He immediately entered the simulation trial and challenged ten thousand Divine Authority Generals.
 He fused with 1,949 Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols and waved the Primordial Judgment Sword with the Primordial Divine Rage. With a slash, supreme sword Qi swept out and destroyed all ten thousand Divine Authority Generals.
 Instant kill!
 Han Jue opened his eyes and frowned.
  He secretly heaved a sigh of relief.
 Indeed, nothing happened.
 He was really afraid that after the battle in the Grand Primordium Domain, the Divine Authority Generals would be strengthened.
 ......
 He entered the simulation trial again. This time, he did not attack first to test the Divine Authority Generals‚Äô power.
 Several breaths later, Han Jue opened his eyes and pondered.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du turned around and asked, ‚ÄúFellow Daoist Han, are you confident?‚Äù
 He could already sense the terrifying aura of ten thousand Divine Authority Generals. He believed that Han Jue could also sense it. In terms of aura, there was probably a number.
 In any case, Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du felt that he would die if he went out.
 The aura of ten thousand Divine Authority Generals gathered together was too powerful, so powerful that it crushed all wishful thinking!
 The other Sages looked at Han Jue, all filled with anticipation and nervousness.
 They were afraid when they truly felt the aura of the Divine Authority Generals. Even Zhou Fan, Long Hao, Zhao Xuanyuan, and the others who had shouted earlier did not dare to brag.
 Facing their gazes, Han Jue said, ‚ÄúYou probably won‚Äôt believe me if I say that I‚Äôm confident. I‚Äôll try my best. Don‚Äôt go out. Just watch me fight the Divine Authority Generals.‚Äù
 The Sages heaved a sigh of relief.
 They were afraid of being sent out to fight. Although they were ashamed, this was the heartless truth.
 er
 Han Jue suddenly stood up and took out the Primordial Judgment Sword.
 The sword overflowed and purple-red light shone in the hall, dazzling the Sages. At the same time, they felt a terrifying killing intent.
 Killing intent!
 Pan Xin was stunned as he thought of his Heaven-Opening Axe.
 Curse the Life faction for seizing my Supreme Treasure!
 Han Jue raised the Primordial Judgment Sword with one hand under the Sages‚Äô gazes. The tip of the sword pointed at the Divine Authority Generals attacking from the Chaos. Shadows appeared above Han Jue‚Äôs head and quickly entered his body.
 In an instant, Han Jue had already fused with 1,949 Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols!
 He raised his left hand and stretched out his index and middle fingers. He slowly slid them along the blade as if he was holding a gun. His gaze and the tip of the sword looked in the same direction, aiming at something.
 The Sages were extremely nervous, not understanding what he wanted to do.
 Zhou Fan couldn‚Äôt help but ask, ‚ÄúMaster, what do you want to do?‚Äù
 Was he going to attack from here?
 Such a ridiculous thought appeared in the minds of all the Sages.
 They were the Divine Authority Generals!
 Wouldn‚Äôt the enemy be alarmed if he attacked from so far away?
 Han Jue said expressionlessly, ‚ÄúEveryone, tell me, can my sword kill ten thousand Divine Authority Generals?‚Äù.
 The entire Universal Hall fell silent.
 The Sages widened their eyes and breathed heavily.
 Even Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du and Lao Dan were the same.
 Lao Dan did not speak, but he was already prepared to escape with Dao Sovereign and the other two when the ten thousand Divine Authority Generals arrived.
 He didn‚Äôt expect Han Jue to be so arrogant!
 Killing ten thousand Divine Authority Generals with a single strike?
 No one dared to jump out and question him. They all stared at the Primordial Judgment Sword in Han Jue‚Äôs hand in a daze.
 Their hearts beat faster.
 If Han Jue was really‚Ä¶
 Gasp
 They did not dare to continue thinking. Logic told them that it was impossible!
 That was a terrifying power that could destroy dozens of Chaotic Fiendcelestials!
 Even the Giant God of Creation, Pangu, died at the ten thousand Divine Authority Generals‚Äô feet!
 In the mysterious space, murky mist filled the air.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor stood in front of a mysterious shadow that shone with a strong light. Between the two sides, an illusion floated and reflected the scene of ten thousand Divine Authority Generals galloping.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor‚Äôs expression was ugly as he felt the terrifying aura of the ten thousand Divine Authority Generals.
 He had encountered Divine Authority Generals before. They had always walked forward calmly. This was the first time they were running so quickly. This was an obvious sign that they were determined to flatten the Heavenly Dao!
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor looked up and asked, ‚ÄúSenior, are you really not allowed to make a move?
 ‚ÄúI only want you to save the Hidden Sect!‚Äù
 The mysterious giant shadow said faintly, ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt enter karma or the Chaos. I naturally won‚Äôt interfere. Evil Heavenly Emperor, don‚Äôt try to interfere. Behind the Divine Authority Generals are the Supreme Rules and the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority. Any existence that dares to stop them will be doomed.‚Äù
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor suddenly knelt down and gritted his teeth. ‚ÄúSenior, please make a move! I‚Äôm willing to serve you forever and be your pawn!
 | W
 ‚ÄúSenior always said that you won‚Äôt enter the Chaos, but you always pay attention to it. I know that you have your ambitions. I‚Äôm willing to serve you no matter what. Since Senior can see me many times, you must have a use for me.‚Äù
 The mysterious giant shadow did not answer.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor was still kneeling as he stared at the ten thousand Divine Authority Generals in the illusion.
 He was extremely nervous.
 The Divine Authority Generals‚Äô speed was tremendous and their strength was terrifying. They could flatten the Heavenly Dao in an instant once they reached it!
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor was originally confident in Han Jue, but he learned a terrifying piece of information.
 The mysterious giant shadow said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve already told you that it‚Äôs impossible for ten thousand Divine Authority Generals to be destroyed. This is the Supreme Rule of the Chaos unless they have the strength to overturn the Chaos. Besides, even if I kill ten thousand Divine Authority Generals, an even more terrifying force will appear next. The Heavenly Dao is already at a dead end. There‚Äôs no way out.‚Äù
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor was moved. He suddenly looked up and asked in a low voice, ‚ÄúIs there an existence stronger than you in the Chaos?‚Äù
 The mysterious giant shadow said, ‚ÄúPerhaps not, but the Chaos itself is the strongest.‚Äù
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor was indignant and was about to continue speaking.
 At this moment!
 A terrifying killing intent came from the illusion, startling him.
 A sword Qi attacked from the depths of the darkness, striking the ten thousand Divine Authority Generals!
 So fast!
 The sword Qi dissipated, and a huge hole was torn in the Dark Forbidden Zone. Layer after layer of space shattered, revealing the Primordial Void.
 The Divine Authority Generals had already vanished.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor was stunned.
  He blinked and stood up to take a closer look, but he still did not see the Divine Authority Generals.
 ‚ÄúSenior, where‚Äôs the Divine Authority Generals? Hurry up and turn to them!‚Äù the Evil Heavenly Emperor urged anxiously.
 However, he did not receive a reply.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor asked, ‚ÄúSenior?‚Äù
 The mysterious giant shadow said faintly, ‚ÄúThe Divine Authority Generals are gone‚Ä¶‚Äù  ‚ÄúGone? What do you mean?‚Äù
 Evil Heavenly Emperor‚Äôs heart beat faster than ever as he asked carefully.
 If he was not wrong‚Ä¶ the Divine Authority Generals were killed by that sword Qi?
 Killing ten thousand Divine Authority Generals in one strike?
 How was that possible‚Ä¶


 In the Universal Hall.
 Han Jue slowly put down the Primordial Judgment Sword. He had just used the Primordial Judgment Sword as the foundation and used the Heaven Earth Mystic Yellow World Piercing Sword Finger to kill ten thousand Divine Authority Generals.
 He admitted that he had definitely used his full strength just now and even shook the Heavenly Dao.
 The Sages had yet to react, but they were all shocked by the sword strike. All of them were silent.
 Lao Dan‚Äôs eyes widened and he trembled.
 Laozi had grasped the Sword Dao, so he was naturally familiar with it. However, Han Jue‚Äôs sword Qi just now shocked him.
 It was definitely not the power of the Sword Dao!
 But it‚Äôs even more terrifying than Laozi‚Äôs Sword Dao!
  Most importantly, Lao Dan felt that the aura of the ten thousand Divine Authority Generals was gone.
 Could it be‚Ä¶
 He did not dare to think about it.
 ......
 The Sages also sensed that the aura of the Divine Authority Generals had vanished. All of them stared at Han Jue, the shock in their hearts indescribable.
 Zhou Fan was the first to break the silence. He asked carefully, ‚ÄúMaster, the Divine Authority Generals‚Ä¶‚Äù
 Han Jue sat down and said, ‚ÄúDead. Did anyone guess that I can kill ten thousand Divine Authority Generals with one strike?‚Äù
 Boom
 The Universal Hall exploded in excitement. All the Sages had gone mad!
 That‚Äôs right!
 Mad!
 The Divine Authority Generals had given them too much pressure in the past hundreds of thousands of years!
 Especially in the battle of the Grand Primordium Domain, dozens of Chaotic Fiendcelestials led by Pangu were forcefully killed. The pressure brought about by this battle reached the extreme!
 Although they had expectations for Han Jue, they originally thought that there would be a fierce battle‚Ä¶
 Unexpectedly!
 Instant kill!
 Killing ten thousand generals with one strike!
 All the Sages were shocked and even felt that it was unreal.
 ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre really dead?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúJust one strike. Divine Might Heavenly Sage, what realm are you at?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúIs that true?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt sense their aura‚Ä¶‚Äù
 ‚ÄúGone? This is too exaggerated. The Divine Might Heavenly Sage is so powerful. I‚Äôm convinced!‚Äù
 The Sages discussed excitedly. Xu Dudao and Pan Xin even knelt down and faced Han Jue with fanatical expressions.
 The Sages of the Hidden Sect also kneeled, causing the other Sages to have no choice but to kneel.
 Only Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du and Lao Dan were still standing.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du hesitated for a moment before bowing.
 The other Sages were fine. They either followed Han Jue as their master or were new Sages. After hearing Han Jue‚Äôs legend, kneeling to him was like kneeling to an ancestor.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du would never be able to stand up again if he knelt. At least, he knew that he was not qualified to sit beside Han Jue if there was a Sage meeting in the future.
 Lao Dan was not a Heavenly Dao Sage, to begin with, so he naturally did not have to kneel. However, he could no longer maintain his calm.
 Han Jue smiled and said, ‚ÄúStand up. Why are you kneeling? The calamity might not end here.‚Äù
 The Sages stood up.
 At the same time.
 Outside the Heavenly Dao.
 Foolish Sword Sage and Red Fate were shocked for a long time before they came back to their senses.
 ‚ÄúTen thousand Divine Authority Generals are gone?‚Äù Red Fate asked nervously.
Diiscover new ùíîtories at nùíêve/lbin(.)c/oùíé The Foolish Sword Sage nodded indifferently.
 Impossible!
 How could he be so powerful?
 Foolish Sword Sage roared in his mind.
 He had never been so excited. At this moment, Han Jue‚Äôs image in his heart suddenly soared.
 This was the first time he admired an existence.
 Worship!
 The Foolish Sword Sage had imagined countless endings and even had the illusion that Han Jue would win.
 However, he didn‚Äôt expect him to kill the Divine Authority Generals with one strike. The Divine Authority Generals had yet to touch the Heavenly Dao before being killed!
 This was even more exaggerated than Pangu slaughtering the three thousand Fiendcelestials back then!
  At that time, the cultivation of the three thousand Fiendcelestials was far inferior to the Divine Authority Generals. Their numbers were also inferior!
 Pangu was not as strong as Han Jue!
 Foolish Sword Sage couldn‚Äôt help but ask, ‚ÄúSo it‚Äôs over?‚Äù
 This time, it was Red Fate who pretended to be cold and said, ‚ÄúPerhaps.‚Äù
 Foolish Sword Sage cursed.
 This woman really knew how to pretend.
 She‚Äôs almost caught up to me!
 In the mysterious space.
 The mysterious giant shadow said after a while, ‚ÄúI was indeed wrong. Han Jue is not simple. I can‚Äôt see through him. Perhaps he‚Äôs the Primordial Fiendcelestial.‚Äù
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor said, ‚ÄúI watched him grow. He shouldn‚Äôt be a Primordial Fiendcelestial. He might be the reincarnation of a mighty figure.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to be nervous. I don‚Äôt care if he‚Äôs the Primordial Fiendcelestial, but the calamity of the Heavenly Dao is not over.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúIs the existence behind the Divine Authority Generals about to appear?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúTake a look.‚Äù
 The mysterious giant shadow did not say anything else.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor had no choice but to look at the illusion. He saw countless stars appear in the ruined void where the Divine Authority Generals had disappeared as if something was condensing again.
 That is?
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor narrowed his
 eyes.
 He was not the only one. Han Jue also saw it.
 He didn‚Äôt let his guard down after sitting down.
 It was too calm!
 Nothing happened after the deaths of the ten thousand Divine Authority Generals. It was clearly abnormal.
 Han Jue seemed to sense something and suddenly looked up.
 His gaze passed through the entire Chaos and arrived above the three thousand Great Dao.
 The Seven Supreme Rules that surpassed the three thousand Great Dao!
 One of the Supreme Rules began to twist slightly before emitting a light that transformed into a beam of light that swooped down at the Chaos.
 This beam of light quickly landed in the dilapidated void where the Divine Authority Generals were previously, absorbing all the surrounding stars.
 Boom!
 Everyone was in an uproar.
 The Sages in the Universal Hall became nervous again and looked at Han Jue.
 They were relieved upon seeing that his expression didn‚Äôt change.
 The Heavenly Dao couldn‚Äôt die with the Divine Might Heavenly Sage around!
 All the Sages thought so.
 It was because Han Jue‚Äôs previous strike was too shocking
 [Primordial Ancestor God has developed hatred towards you. Current Hatred Points: 6 stars]
 Han Jue saw a line of words appear in front of him and immediately checked his interpersonal relationships to find the Primordial Ancestral God.
 [Primordial Ancestor God: Perfected Great Dao Supreme Realm, Great Dao Divine Spirit, Chaotic Origin Spirit, Great Dao Controller, Leader of the Divine Spirits. Because you killed ten thousand Divine Authority Generals, he is filled with trepidation towards you. Current Hatred Points: 6 stars]
 The leader of the Divine Spirits!
 He had finally exposed himself!
 Han Jue was secretly pleased. Since he knew the name, he could curse him in the future.
 Even if he couldn‚Äôt curse, Han Jue could visit him in his dreams and kill him with the Dark Forbidden Zone.
 The leader of the Divine Spirits had not reached the Dao Creator Realm, either. Han Jue was satisfied. He would be frightened to death if a Dao Creator really appeared.
 Han Jue was already fighting for the peak, and it was not far away!
 He stopped thinking and looked at the broken void where the Divine Authority Generals had disappeared. A mighty figure vaguely appeared in the pillar of light.
  Han Jue could feel that the other party‚Äôs aura was increasing rapidly.
 The Sages were moved.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du‚Äôs expression darkened as he muttered, ‚ÄúDao Ancestor!‚Äù
 The Sages were moved the moment the Dao Ancestor was mentioned!
 At this moment!
 Han Jue suddenly stood up and took out the Primordial Judgment Sword again. He instantly fused with 1,949 Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols and used the Primordial Judgment Sword to execute the Heaven Earth Mystic Yellow World Piercing Sword Finger.
 A fair battle?
 Impossible!
 Just die!
