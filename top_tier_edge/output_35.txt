 Hearing the man’s answer, Han Jue was a little stunned.
 Back then, Li Qingzi often used all sorts of benefits to lure him out, but he also rejected him.
 Perhaps the soul was still that soul, but the person had changed unknowingly.
 Han Jue suddenly felt that reincarnation was meaningless.
 In the end, the ones who benefited from reincarnation were only the mighty figures who had descended into the mortal world to train. To mortals, what was the difference between drinking Meng Po’s soup and being destroyed in body and soul?
 Not all mortals could encounter a mighty figure to awaken their memories.
  Perhaps the existence of reincarnation was just that mighty figures did not dare to destroy ghosts and were afraid of bearing negative karma.
 Han Jue smiled and asked, “Are you really not learning it?”
 The man said warily, “What are you trying to do? This is the Jade Pure Sacred Sect. You will quickly be discovered if you dare to attack
 me!”
 Han Jue was amused. “The more you refuse, the more I want to teach you. No one will hear you even if you shout your lungs out. I’ve already isolated this bamboo forest!”
 The man turned around and ran like the wind.
 Han Jue raised his hand and moved him back, pressing him to the ground.
 The man’s face smashed into the grass. He felt as if he was pressed down by a mountain and could not move.
 “Kid, you’re still not cautious enough. You should have fled the moment you saw me because you didn’t sense my appearance. It meant that I wanted to secretly approach you with ill intentions. You have to be more cautious in your next life!”
 Han Jue smiled disdainfully. The man felt despair.
 That’s right!
 Why am I so stupid?
 Endless regret surged in the man’s heart. He suffered a heavy blow and fainted.
 The sunlight shone on his face and the man felt an itch. He slowly opened his eyes.
 He suddenly widened his eyes and jumped up.
 He looked around warily, but Han Jue was already gone.
 He was stunned to find that he could not remember the man’s face. Could it be a dream?
 …
 The man discovered that there was a new memory in his mind. It was a sword technique!
 Heavenly Sword Dao!
 “It’s not a dream. It’s real…”
 The man touched his body and discovered that his clothes were clean and he was not injured.
 What did the other party want?
 He couldn’t help but recall the Heavenly Sword Dao and was gradually moved.
 What a domineering sword technique!
 No!
 It was the Sword Dao!
 “Did I encounter a calamity or a benefactor?” the man muttered to himself. He carefully tried to recall Han Jue’s true appearance but to no avail. However, that blurry figure gave him a sense of familiarity that he hadn’t felt for a long time.
 It was as if he was very familiar with this figure a long time ago.
 This vague sense of familiarity suddenly caused a sense of sorrow to surge into his heart.
 The man fell into a daze.
 …
 Inside the Daoist temple.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and frowned.
 After a hundred years, the soul fragment had already ended its journey. Its soul dissipated and all its memories surged into his mind.
 He also sighed.
 He met some old friends during this trip.
 Although things had changed, the memories were still there.
 Han Jue adjusted his state of mind and smiled. “After relaxing, it’s time to cultivate and find a place for the third Dao Field.”
 Han Jue’s heart skipped a beat.
 Soon, Liu Bei came to visit.
 Liu Bei was Han Jue’s Reincarnation Avatar. He had once possessed the body of the Victorious Fighting Buddha and was now a Pseudo-Sage.
 Back then, Liu Bei had gone to find a place to hide the Hidden Sect Island.
  Liu Bei knelt in front of Han Jue respectfully. He looked calm, but his heart was surging.
 He was both surprised and panicked.
 He was pleasantly surprised that Han Jue still remembered him and panicked that Han Jue would probably give him a mission.
 He had inherited Han Jue’s personality and was timid and cautious.
 However, his cultivation had stagnated for a long time. He needed an opportunity to break through.
 This mission was an opportunity!
 Han Jue said, “I need you to go to the Chaos and find a suitable location for the Dao Field. You can’t mention this to anyone. Are you willing? This period of time is very long. It will probably be difficult to find it in hundreds of thousands of years. I will teach you a Mystical Power. If you are in danger, you can summon me at any time.”
 Chaos…
 Hundreds of thousands of years…
Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n)) Liu Bei trembled in fear.
 He wanted to refuse, but he could not!
 “What? You’re not willing? Then forget it.” Han Jue was a little disappointed when he saw no reaction from him.
 Liu Bei immediately looked up and said, “I’m willing!”
 Han Jue smiled in satisfaction. “What do you need to prepare?”
 Liu Bei shook his head. “There’s no need to prepare.”
 Han Jue immediately waved his sleeve and sent him out of the Heavenly Dao.
 Although the Chaos was huge, it was still very difficult to encounter a Primordial Chaos Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal. Without stepping into a great opportunity, it was very difficult for a Pseudo-Sage to be targeted by a Primordial Chaos Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal.
 The karma on Liu Bei was the Victorious Fighting Buddha. They couldn’t deduce that he was Han Jue’s clone. At most, they could deduce that he was related to the Hidden Sect.
 Now, the Hidden Sect had at least five million disciples training in the Chaos. This identity was not worth mentioning. Han Jue’s enemies were not stupid enough to think that they could use a Hidden Sect disciple to threaten him.
 nco
 However, Liu Bei would definitely encounter some difficulties. Han Jue had to be prepared.
 He began to use the derivation function. “Can I control the Heaven-Opening Axe if I upgrade it again?”
 The Mystical Destiny Book wouldn’t recognize him as its master, making him wary of the Ultimate Supreme Treasure.
 (1 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 A quadrillion years…
 This was already the value of a Dao Creator!
 Continue!
 [Yes, but Pangu will sense it when the upgrade succeeds.) Han Jue showed a frown.
 Pangu’s cultivation level could not be seen for the time being. In Han Jue’s heart, he was an existence that could not be provoked.
 Forget it, I won’t upgrade it for the time being. It’s enough as it is, anyway.
 Han Jue immediately entered the simulation trial and fought a hundred Foolish Sword Sages with the Ultimate Dao Treasure, Heaven-Opening Axe.
 Slaughter!
 Awesome!
 Again!
 Two hundred could still be slaughtered easily! Three hundred was too many. He could barely win!
 Four hundred of them were impossible to beat, but he could still last for a while!
 Five hundred. Damn it, he couldn’t withstand ten breaths of time!
 Han Jue left the simulation trial. He was still very confident.
 Such strength could already dominate everyone below the Great Dao Supreme Realm. They were all mysterious and rare existences that would not appear easily.
 It was impossible for Liu Bei to provoke an existence at the Great Dao Supreme level!
 Han Jue closed his eyes and started cultivating.
 Time passed quickly.
 Fifty thousand years passed in a flash.
 Han Jue came to the second Dao Field and released the Wood Breath Fiendcelestial he had nurtured previously to let Murong Qi receive him.
 Han Jue chatted with Li Yao and Dao Comprehension Sword before returning to the main Dao Field.
 He was about to check his emails when he suddenly frowned.
 “This feeling is…”
 Han Jue felt inexplicably uneasy as if something was summoning him from afar.
 He began to deduce.
 A voice sounded in Han Jue’s mind.


 The Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial summoned the Chaotic Fiendcelestials…
 Han Jue narrowed his eyes. This was not a good sign.
 Although he had already hidden that he was a Primordial Fiendcelestial, there could only be one Primordial Fiendcelestial in the Chaos. They would have to face each other sooner or later.
 “I want to know the Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial’s cultivation level!”
 Han Jue used the derivation function.
 (500 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
  Continue!
 (Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial: Late-stage Great Dao Supreme Realm, Chaotic Fiendcelestial, one of the three thousand Fiendcelestials of the Primordial Era]
 The introduction was very simple. The Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial’s figure appeared in Han Jue’s mind. His figure was terrifying and indescribable. His aura was fearless and filled with the terrifying aura of an invincible expert.
 Han Jue frowned.
 Very strong.
 The reason why the Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial sent a voice transmission to him was probably that it believed that he was also a Chaotic Fiendcelestial.
 Or he could use his clone to give the Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial face and understand the situation.
 But where was the Grand Primordium Domain?
 Han Jue frowned.
 At this moment, a memory surged into his mind. It was a vast map that pointed to the location of the Grand Primordium Domain.
 Han Jue was surprised. What method was this?
 He could actually recall memories from afar!
 Most importantly, he had never seen the Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial before.
 Han Jue waved a soul fragment and let it move, quickly entering the depths of the chaos.
 After that, he checked the emails.
 (Your grand-disciple Chu Shiren has absorbed the will of all living beings and learned a Mystical Power. His cultivation has increased greatly.]
 [Your good friend Evil Heavenly Emperor was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure and was severely injured.]
 (Your son Han Tuo was suppressed by a mysterious mighty figure and fell into the Endless Abyss.)
 [Your disciple Zhou Fan was cursed by a mysterious curse.]
 (Your good friend, the Divine Robe Daoist, discussed the Dao with a mysterious mighty figure. His cultivation has increased.]
 [Your good friend Pan Xin was attacked by your good friend Ancestor Xitian and was severely injured.)
 [Your good friend Huang Zuntian created three thousand Heaven and Earth Fiendcelestials. His cultivation has increased greatly.]
 (Your disciple Dao Sovereign was attacked by a mysterious demon] x7093218
 [Your disciple Zhao Xuanyuan…)
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor, Zhou Fan, and Han Tuo were often beaten. Han Jue was already used to it.
 They would use the Invocation Technique if they really encountered irreconcilable trouble.
 As for Pan Xin, why was he fighting for his life again?
 Wasn’t it just a Dharma treasure?
 Was it worth fighting to the death?
 Ancestor Xitian’s cultivation level had been increasing ever since he had turned dark. He had already reached the late-stage Great Dao Primordial Chaos Realm.
 Since Ancestor Xitian could severely injure Pan Xin with his strength, he could also easily kill him.
 It seemed that the ancestor was still benevolent.
  Han Jue continued reading. Huang Zuntian had created three thousand Heaven and Earth Fiendcelestials…
 What is it?
 Are you imitating me?
 Han Jue began to look forward to Huang Zuntian’s future.
 He actually didn’t rely on Han Jue. He relied almost entirely on himself to rise.
 Such people had great providence. In novels, they were all protagonists.
 Further down, Dao Sovereign, Zhao Xuanyuan, and Jiang Yi were still being beaten.
 In short, nothing made Han Jue uneasy for the time being. Then, he closed his eyes and continued cultivating.
 It had been four hundred thousand years since the last breakthrough. The next one was getting closer and closer.
 In the starry sky, wisps of seven-colored light circled the stars.
 On one of the gray stars, Dao Sovereign, Zhao Xuanyuan, and Jiang Yi meditated behind each other, forming a triangle.
 Jiang Yi suddenly asked, “Brothers, how long do we have to wait?”
 Dao Sovereign did not open his eyes as he said, “Let’s wait a little longer. The time isn’t
 ripe.”
 Zhao Xuanyuan grunted.
 Jiang Yi grumbled, “Is that fellow lying to us? He said that there’s a Supreme Treasure hidden here. Could he be using us as bait?”
 Zhao Xuanyuan couldn’t help but say, “I’ll really have to leave if we’re deceived again. It might not be bad to stay in the Hundred Peak Immortal River and follow Master. Recently, Li Yao, Murong Qi, and the others have been secretly hidden by Master. There must be a huge opportunity! “And that Zhou Fan. That kid actually surpassed the three of us. I can’t tolerate this.”
 Zhou Fan was now famous. With the Heavenly Court behind him, even the three of them, who were wandering around, had heard of the Great Dao Tower.
 “Since ancient times, Sages as young as us are rare. They can be said to be the strongest prodigies of an era, people with great providence!”
 Hearing Dao Sovereign’s words, Zhao Xuanyuan felt a headache.
 Jiang Yi couldn’t help but interrupt, “You’re going too far!”
 Zhao Xuanyuan and Jiang Yi heaved a sigh of relief.
 He was afraid that Dao Sovereign would be stubborn.
 “Hahaha. Three young friends, how can I lie to you!”
 A loud laugh sounded. The three of them turned around and saw an old man in a raincoat flying over on a huge water buffalo.
 This water buffalo looked no different from the ones used in farming in the mortal world.
 Dao Sovereign stood up and asked, “Where is the Supreme Treasure?”
  The water buffalo landed on the ground. The elder in the raincoat smiled and said, “It’s already in front of you. Look up and you’ll see it.”
 Shocked, the three of them hurriedly looked around.
 However, there was no sign of the Supreme Treasure.
 Zhao Xuanyuan narrowed his eyes. “Could it be those seven-colored lights?”
 The elder in the raincoat stroked his beard and nodded. “That’s right. These lights are not simple. They are formed by a Supreme Treasure from the beginning of the Chaos. I have a way to condense them into their true form, but this will attract the counterattack of the artifact spirit. After it’s done, the Supreme Treasure will be yours. I only want the pill hidden in the Supreme Treasure.”
 Dao Sovereign asked, “What pill is it? Will the treasure be ruined after you take it?”
 The old man in the raincoat smiled. “Of course not. This pill is not related to the Supreme Treasure. It’s just that its master hid the pill inside it. I’ll tell you the truth. This pill is called the Primordial Pill. It can create a Primordial Fiendcelestial. If I give you this pill, it will definitely attract a fatal disaster.”
 Dao Sovereign and the other two were moved. They had naturally heard of the legend of the Primordial Fiendcelestial. It was said that it would cause a Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity!


 “Aren’t you afraid of death?” Dao Sovereign frowned.
 Zhao Xuanyuan and Jiang Yi looked at each other and were secretly vigilant.
 Dao Sovereign and the other two were deep in thought.
 They had naturally heard of the legends of Pangu, but they were only legends in the end.
 They couldn’t be sure if the Primordial Fiendcelestial was good or bad.
 No matter what, this would be a huge karma!
  One would fall into eternal damnation if he was not careful!
 Dao Sovereign asked, “Can a mere pill do what Pangu couldn’t even after killing three thousand Chaotic Fiendcelestials?”
 The elder in the raincoat smiled. “Indeed, I’m not 100% sure. But it has nothing to do with you, right?” The water buffalo raised its head as if expressing its impatience.
 Dao Sovereign glanced at Zhao Xuanyuan and Jiang Yi.
 He hesitated. “Can we give up? We didn’t know that there was such a huge karma. We’re only Primordial Chaos Zenith Heaven Golden Immortals. You shouldn’t insist on
 us.”
 The elder in the raincoat smiled. “Of course. However, this Supreme Treasure is not ordinary. After you miss it, you will never encounter it again. Don’t think that the Chaos is vast. Such Supreme Treasures are limited. Most of them are still in the hands of those mighty figures.
 “After this is done, I will sever karma and ensure that you are safe.” Zhao Xuanyuan asked warily, “Are you going to silence us?”
 “This is not the first time we’ve worked together. There’s nothing I can do if you don’t believe me.”
 Dao Sovereign gritted his teeth. “Alright! I’ll listen to you! When are we moving?”
 The elder in the raincoat got off the water buffalo and said, “Don’t panic. I’ll cast the array formation first to prevent other mighty figures from spying on us.”
 The water buffalo lay down and rolled on the ground.
 Jiang Yi looked at it with a strange expression.
 “It looks like a dog.”
 Bright temples floated above the clouds in a world filled with crimson light. A majestic peak stood out. It also stood above the clouds, but it emitted a golden light.
 At the top of the mountain was a Buddhist palace with the words Thunderclap Monastery carved on the plaque.
 Figures appeared in front of the monastery. The leader was Zhou Fan.
 Han Yu’s grand-disciple, Qin Ling, followed behind him and looked around curiously.
 Thunderclap Monastery opened and the group stepped into the hall.
 What greeted them were Buddhas sitting on lotus thrones and floating in the air. At the front was a huge Buddha that was tens of thousands of feet tall and peerlessly majestic.
 Chu Shiren could be seen upon a careful look!
 Chu Shiren had already put on his kasaya. He had a benevolent expression and holy temperament.
 Zhou Fan smiled. “Not bad. You’re even more Buddhist than the Buddhist Sect.”
 Chu Shiren also smiled. “I’m originally the Supreme Buddha. It’s only right for me to create another Buddhist Sect.”
 Zhou Fan sized up the surrounding Buddhas and said, “It looks good, but your Buddhist Sect still lacks a cornerstone. It’s not strong enough.”
 The Buddhas were furious.
 Zhou Fan smiled. “I’ll give you a batch of cultivators in the future. You can choose from the Great Dao Tower’s prison if you are worried.”
  Chu Shiren smiled and nodded.
 Only the relationship of fellow disciples allowed them to joke without restraint.
 Zhou Fan said, “Back to the topic. Why did you call me here? You didn’t ask me to see your results, right?”.
 Chu Shiren said helplessly, “How can that be? To be honest, recently, the Buddhist World has been targeted by a mysterious force. The other party has at least three Primordial Chaos Zenith Heaven Golden Immortals and even a Freedom mighty figure. They’re forcing the Buddhist World to submit to them. In the future, we will pay tribute to them and erect their statues to spread their reputation. Otherwise, they will flatten the Buddhist World. Helpless, I can only look for you, Uncle-Master.”
 Uncle-Master?
 The angry Buddhas were stunned. The dissatisfaction in their hearts vanished.
 No wonder the other party spoke so arrogantly and did not show mercy. They were family.
 “Tell me in detail. I’ll definitely help you in this matter. I’ll flatten them no matter how strong they are!” Zhou Fan said heroically and unquestionably.
 Qin Ling looked excited. Another battle was about to begin!
 Chu Shiren did not hide anything and began to tell them one by one.
 In the darkness, a bright crack suddenly appeared. A figure tore it apart and stepped
 out.
 It was Han Jue.
 Or rather, his clone.
 He focused his gaze forward. In the depths of the darkness was a ball of light that looked like the sun. It emitted a vast aura.
 It was the Grand Primordium Domain!
 Han Jue took a deep breath and flew forward.
 At this moment, a figure flew over from the side. It was a woman.
 This woman wore a purple dress and had a dignified posture. Her hair was tied up under a crown. She was considered beautiful.
 “Fellow Daoist.”
 The purple-dressed woman’s voice floated over.
 Han Jue stopped. He couldn’t see through the purple-dressed woman’s cultivation. She probably had a Supreme Treasure on her.
 The purple-dressed woman sized him up and smiled. “I didn’t expect there to be such a good-looking person like you among the Fiendcelestials.”
 Han Jue said, “The appearance is only an illusion. With our cultivation levels, we can look whatever we want.”
 The purple-dressed woman covered her mouth and laughed. “Although that’s the case, their aesthetic taste is different. Most Fiendcelestials have different aesthetic tastes than us. I’m the Chaotic Fiendcelestial, Red Fate.”
 Han Jue replied, “I’m the Chaotic Fiendcelestial, Han Jue.”
 Red Fate smiled. “Fellow Daoist Han is also a clone. It seems that you are as wary of the Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial as me. Why don’t we go to the Grand Primordium Domain together? I’ve heard of Fellow Daoist Han’s reputation. You’re a new Chaotic Fiendcelestial. You’re probably not familiar with the other Chaotic Fiendcelestials. I can introduce you to them.”
 Han Jue hesitated for a moment but still nodded.
  Since the other party could tell that he was a clone, she shouldn’t harm him because that would only offend him and not kill him.
 The two of them flew towards the Grand Primordium Domain.
 During this time, Han Jue saw several figures quickly flying into the Grand Primordium Domain, not disturbing each other.
 It seemed that most Chaotic Fiendcelestials were very cautious.
 Red Fate smiled and said, “Speaking of which, I have to thank Fellow Daoist Han. I hate that Despair Dao Spirit so much.”
 Han Jue asked, “Were you also bullied when you attained the Great Dao?”
 Red Fate’s words were filled with flattery, making Han Jue even more vigilant.


 Red Fate finally stopped flattering him after entering the Grand Primordium Domain. Han Jue secretly heaved a sigh of relief.
 He had thought that the Chaotic Fiendcelestials were all arrogant and bloodthirsty. He didn’t expect there to be an existence like Red Fate.
 Red Fate was not like a Chaotic Fiendcelestial, but more like a human.
 The Grand Primordium Domain was wrapped in a layer of fire. The interior was extremely vast, not the least inferior to the Immortal World. The blue sky, white clouds, green mountains, and rivers formed a world of their own.
 However, Han Jue didn’t sense the aura of living beings.
 The two of them flew all the way and soon arrived at a huge palace that towered into the clouds. The door alone was a million feet tall. There were two huge cauldrons in front of the door, each with a stick of incense. Sand smoke filled the air and transformed into clouds that enveloped the entire world.
 A giant stood in front of the door. He wore bronze heavy armor and his true appearance could not be seen.
  He said, “Fiendcelestials, please enter the hall. Master is already waiting inside.”
 Han Jue and Red Fate entered the hall.
 Han Jue felt a powerful aura and secretly felt pity.
 How good would it be if his clone could also use the simulation trial to detect the vicinity?
 The hall was blank. The space was filled with white light as if it was an independent space. There were meditation cushions in front of him, each ten thousand feet away. They were all facing the same direction.
 The Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial!
 The Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial wore a black robe. Its head was like black flames and its true appearance could not be seen. It was mysterious and terrifying.
 More than twenty Chaotic Fiendcelestials were already sitting down.
 Han Jue and Red Fate looked at each other and sat down on neighboring mats.
 “This is Fellow Daoist Han Jue from the Heavenly Dao. The younger generation is truly impressive. He killed the Despair Dao Spirit and defeated the Divine Robe Daoist. Fourteen Great Dao Sages died to him. He has fought for us Chaotic Fiendcelestials.” The Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial suddenly looked at Han Jue and said.
 With that said, Han Jue felt many Sage Senses sweep over him.
 Han Jue replied politely, “I had no choice. Compared to you, I’m still far inferior.”
 He did not deny it. Keeping a low profile would only make him look hypocritical.
 The Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial sighed. “Back then, the three thousand Fiendcelestials stood in the Chaos. What a grand occasion. The Chaotic Races trembled in fear and despair at our birth. Unfortunately, Pangu was heartless and slaughtered his own kind to attain the Dao. I still feel hatred when I think of it now. Fellow Daoist Han, you have to control the Heavenly Dao well. Don’t let Pangu have the opportunity to revive!”
 The other Fiendcelestials sighed. Most of them had ancient voices and were probably Chaotic Fiendcelestials who had survived the Pangu Calamity.
 Seeing that they were chatting, Han Jue didn’t reply and listened quietly.
 He wasn’t a true Chaotic Fiendcelestial and would not befriend these people.
 He was here to hear what these Fiendcelestials wanted to do to him!
 Han Jue replied, “I understand.”
 The Chaotic Fiendcelestials of the ancient group talked about the past, like big shots reminiscing about the past.
 How pretentious.
 From the looks of it, he still had to wait for a while.
 Han Jue was also curious about how many Chaotic Fiendcelestials were hidden in the current Chaos.
 Several days later, the Foolish Sword Sage also arrived.
 He was not surprised to see Han Jue. Instead, he found a mat close to him and sat down. He started to chat with Han Jue with a voice transmission.
 However, he knew his limits and didn’t challenge him again.
 The Foolish Sword Sage finally fell silent after chatting for half a day.
 He also belonged to the ancient group, but he did not participate in the Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial’s conversation.
 Perhaps it was Han Jue’s imagination, but the fiendcelestials seemed to reject the Foolish Sword Sage.
 “Fellow Daoist, do you know Sage Fated Secrets?”
 A voice suddenly floated into his ears.
 Han Jue glanced over. A gray-robed old Daoist was staring at him.
 Han Jue replied, “I’ve heard of him, but I don’t know him. He had already died when I attained the Dao.”
 The gray-robed old Daoist sent a voice transmission, “That’s true. My useless disciple was defeated by the Dark Forbidden Lord and abandoned by the Heavenly Dao Sages.”
 Disciple?
 Han Jue was secretly surprised.
 Daoist Destiny!
 Han Jue remembered. In the past, he had deduced that Daoist Destiny and Nüwa were plotting something. However, after Sage Fated Secrets died, Daoist Destiny had never appeared again.
 Han Jue replied, “My condolences. The current Heavenly Dao is no longer the original Heavenly Dao. Your disciple is not the only Sage who died.”
 “That’s true. I don’t blame you. I just want to befriend you. I’m very curious about you.”
 “It’s naturally a good thing to have another friend.”
 “That’s right.”
 The two of them began to exchange pleasantries.
 (Daoist Destiny has a favorable impression of you. Current favorability: 2 stars]
 Han Jue didn’t mind. It was all an act.
 The Grand Primordium Hall finally closed. Han Jue counted. There were a total of 67 Chaotic Fiendcelestials, more than he had imagined.
 However, most of them were only at the Freedom Realm.
 The Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial stopped chatting and soon, the Grand Primordium Hall quietened down.
 After a long while…
 The Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial opened his eyes and said, “Everyone, we have gathered for the Primordial Fiendcelestial this time. Although there is a prophecy that the Primordial Fiendcelestial has yet to be born, this matter has already endangered us Chaotic Fiendcelestials. It’s not impossible if a Great Dao Divine Spirit, Eternal Divine Spirit, Chaotic Lifeform, and the others use the Primordial Fiendcelestial to eliminate us.”
 Han Jue was secretly curious. Who spread the prophecy?
 He had to calculate when he returned.
 The Ancient Fiendcelestials spoke again and began to discuss where the Primordial Fiendcelestial might be born and who could harm them.
 Han Jue would answer when it involved the Heavenly Dao. Everything was fine as long as it didn’t involve sovereignty.
 This conversation was very long and would probably last for a long time.
 Inside the Daoist temple.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and frowned. He entered seclusion for another ten thousand years, but his clone had yet to return.
 Without his clone returning, Han Jue felt uneasy and found it difficult to calm down and cultivate in peace.
 After all, a group of mighty figures was plotting to kill him behind his back. It would be very difficult for them to calm down if it were anyone else.
 Han Jue opened the emails to relax.
  [Your good friend Ancestor Xitian was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure.]
 [Your good friend Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du obtained a Supreme Treasure by chance. His providence has increased greatly.)
 (Your disciple Dao Sovereign was swept into the chaos of space-time.)
 (Your disciple Zhao Xuanyuan was involved in the chaos of space-time.]
 (Your good friend Jiang Yi was involved in the chaos of space-time.]
 (Your good friend Yi Tian has awakened the power of a Chaotic Fiendcelestial. His cultivation has increased greatly.)  (Your son Han Tuo sacrificed his body and surpassed his limits. His cultivation has increased greatly.)


 Jing Tiangong became Life…
 Han Jue’s expression became strange.
 This time, he could really package Life as a force of the Dark Forbidden Lord!
 Han Jue noticed that Yi Tian had awakened the power of a Chaotic Fiendcelestial. Yi Tian was the Son of the Heavenly Dao and was the reincarnation of a Chaotic Fiendcelestial. In the previous battle of the Heavenly Court, he had a favorable impression of Han Jue that was directly six-star.
 This time, Yi Tian and Han Tuo seemed to be in danger again. Han Tuo even sacrificed his body.
 Bastard!
  His body was a gift from his parents. How could he sacrifice it just like that?
 Why didn’t Han Tuo use the Invocation Technique if he really encountered trouble?
 He should be able to resolve it.
 Han Jue thought silently.
 He discovered that his friends and relatives rarely took the initiative to use the Invocation Technique, even if he made it clear.
 They would rather crawl back and forth between life and death than alarm him.
 “Am I too cold and giving them the illusion that I don’t want to be disturbed?”
 Han Jue reflected.
 Forget it.
 He couldn’t be bothered to think about it.
 No one cares if I die in seclusion after so long!
 Han Jue continued reading the emails.
 After reading the emails, Han Jue used the Dark Nightmare to visit Jing Tiangong in his dreams. He used the image of the Dark Forbidden Lord.
 “Forbidden Lord!”
 Jing Tiangong knelt down in surprise, his body trembling.
 How many years had it been!
 The Dark Forbidden Lord finally contacted him!
 Han Jue asked in a hoarse voice, “Jing Tiangong, have your feelings for me changed?”
 Jing Tiangong hurriedly denied, “Of course not! I will always be under you, Forbidden Lord. I can do anything you want me to!”
 He began to express his loyalty crazily and was terrified.
 He thought that he had offended the Dark Forbidden Lord by joining Life.
 Han Jue said, “Then tell me about your situation.”
 Jing Tiangong nodded and began to talk about his experiences over the years.
 It had been a long time since the Dark Forbidden Lord had appeared. The Immortal World had even forgotten about his existence. This made Jing Tiangong extremely unhappy. Therefore, he left the Divine Palace and brought his trusted aides to the Chaos to reestablish the Darkness Sect. Later, he was found by Shi Dudao and invited into the sect.
 Jing Tiangong asked carefully, “Is Shi Dudao your…”
 So, Shi Dudao was developing on his own…
 Han Jue said, “That’s right, but you have to hide this. You can also help me teach Shi Dudao a lesson. There are some things that you have to be cautious about.”
 Jing Tiangong was pleasantly surprised. He also had doubts about Shi Dudao, but if it was true, that would be great!
 He had finally found a like-minded person!
 m
 Furthermore, the other party was Shi Dudao! Shi Dudao was once the number one person below the Heavenly Dao Sages. He was publicly acknowledged to be powerful!
 His future was limitless now that he had attained the Dao!
 “I understand. I will definitely advance with Fellow Daoist Shi in the future!”
 Jing Tiangong patted his chest and promised excitedly.
 Han Jue instructed him again and then ended the dream.
 He opened his eyes and smiled.
 This was also good. Since Jing Tiangong could acknowledge Shi Dudao, the foundation of the Dark Forbidden Lord was finally formed.
 Han Jue closed his eyes and started cultivating.
 In the Grand Primordium Hall, the Chaotic Fiendcelestial finally made a decision after more than ten thousand years of discussion.
 Han Jue was almost sleepy.
 Now, they had finally reached a consensus.
 “From today onwards, we will all send disciples to search for the Primordial Fiendcelestial. Any prodigy who might be the Primordial Fiendcelestial must be controlled immediately,” the Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial said in a low voice.
 The Fiendcelestials agreed.
 The Fiendcelestials had no objections.
 The Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial waved his sleeve and the door to the Grand Primordium Hall opened.
 The Fiendcelestials stood up and left.
 Han Jue also left.
 Although he didn’t hear any important information, he remembered the names and looks of these Fiendcelestials. It would be convenient to curse them in the future.
 When his identity could no longer be hidden, rather than waiting for death, it was better to kill all the enemies first.
 Being invincible was not only about strength but also about methods!
 Just as he walked out of the Grand Primordium Hall, Red Fate caught up and smiled. “Fellow Daoist Han, can we find a place to chat alone?”
 Han Jue glanced at her and said, “Next time. The Heavenly Dao has something on. I have to leave first.”
 “Alright, I’ll personally visit you in the Heavenly Dao when I have the chance.”
 “Goodbye!”
 Han Jue’s clone quickly fled.
 Red Fate watched him leave, her smile disappearing
 The Foolish Sword Sage walked up and snorted. “I advise you not to court death. Fellow Daoist Han looks kind, but his killing intent is not small.”
 Red Fate glanced at him and said, “If I don’t harm him, why would he want to kill me?”
 “Hehe.”
 The Foolish Sword Sage shook his head and laughed. He then turned into a sword beam and left.
 At the same time.
 While his clone was still traveling, Han Jue already knew everything that it had experienced.
 He could switch his consciousness to his clone at any time. The clone could also deal with everything independently. “Unify the Chaotic Fiendcelestials? Hehe, how can you unite them if I curse you to death?” Han Jue thought to himself. But he was only thinking about it.
 Currently, he could use the Fiendcelestial Race to intimidate the thieves.
 With the Primordial Fiendcelestial’s personality, this matter would quickly spread throughout the Chaos.
 At that time, the Chaotic mighty figures would know that Han Jue had already established a connection with the Fiendcelestial Race.
 The enemy of every Chaotic Fiendcelestial would be the public enemy of the entire Fiendcelestial Race!
 This power was definitely terrifying. Even Life was not enough!
 Every Chaotic Fiendcelestial controlled a huge force!
 Han Jue didn’t think too much and continued cultivating. The ten-thousand-year session had not ended yet, he couldn’t stop cultivating
 Ten thousand years was not enough.
 I should cultivate for a while more!
 Let’s go for a hundred thousand years!
 In the illusory mysterious space, Han Tuo’s soul floated inside. He was wrapped by faintly discernible chains.
 There was nothing else in the surrounding space, only a distorted space of various colors.
  Here, there was no hope, as if it was a land of exile.
 Han Tuo could not speak. He was accumulating strength.
 “If I’m like Father, with so many Dharma Idols…”
 Han Tuo’s eyes were extremely cold. He didn’t believe that he couldn’t escape this endless abyss!
 He kept recalling the scene of Han Jue fighting
 A black shadow vaguely wanted to rush out of his body. It was a Fiendcelestial Dharma idol.
