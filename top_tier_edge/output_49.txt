 The Foolish Sword Sage was instantly vigilant.
 He felt that it was a trap.
 He had asked about Han Jue after his defeat. This child was extremely cautious and never left the Heavenly Dao.
 He asked cautiously, “Why do you want to see me?”
 “Let’s catch up and discuss the Divine Authority Generals.”
 “Not in the dream?”
 “Are you afraid of me? You’ve stepped into the Great Dao Supreme Realm twice, after all. Are you still afraid of me?”
 “How do you know that?”
  The Foolish Sword Sage became even more vigilant.
 Han Jue said, “I heard from Red Fate. She has already decided to move to the Heavenly Dao and join forces with me.”
 The Foolish Sword Sage’s brows relaxed. “You really want to deal with the Divine Authority Generals?”
 “That’s right!”
 ......
 Han Jue was stunned.
 On second thought, this was a good thing.
 He secretly asked, “Can I insta-kill the Foolish Sword Sage?”
 [400 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 (Yes]
 That was good.
 Han Jue said, “Of course.”
 The Foolish Sword Sage smiled. “The Divine Authority Generals are indeed impressive. They aren’t ordinary Great Dao Sages. They can even monitor the independent domain of a Great Dao Supreme. I’ve also been thinking about how to resist the Divine Authority Generals during this period of time.”
 Han Jue asked curiously, “A Great Dao Supreme can’t defeat ten thousand Divine Authority Generals?”
 Foolish Sword Sage rolled his eyes. “How? It’s said that they have the cultivation of Great Dao Sages, but they’re still formed by the Supreme Rule. It’s just that the level of power is equivalent to a Great Dao Sage. It’s essentially very difficult to destroy them.”
 “Then, how many Divine Authority Generals can you fight?”
 “A… a hundred.”
 Han Jue showed a frown.
 That was equivalent to a hundred Foolish Sword Sages at the Great Dao Supreme Realm.
 Han Jue asked, “There are also Great Dao Supreme existences among the Chaotic Fiendcelestials. Won’t the Chaotic Fiendcelestials have a chance of winning if they all join forces?”
 Han Jue was deep in thought.
 Foolish Sword Sage asked, “Have you also attained the Great Dao Supreme?”
 Han Jue hesitated for a moment but still chose to nod.
 He should trust this guy with such a high favorability.
 “How impressive,” the Foolish Sword Sage said with a strange expression.
 He cursed silently.
 No wonder!
 This fellow wanted to bully him?
 The Foolish Sword Sage was even more shocked.
 Han Jue’s strength was already terrifying. How could he be an enemy if his cultivation realm caught up?
 “By the way, who killed you the previous time when you were a Great Dao Supreme?” Han Jue asked curiously.
 The Foolish Sword Sage replied, “I’m not sure, either. Speaking of which, I was also confused at that time. I had just attained supremacy and thought that I was the only Great Dao Supreme…
  “I don’t know who the other party is, but he’s definitely terrifying. He might even be the strongest existence in the Chaos.”
 Han Jue didn’t use the derivation function. In any case, he was the Foolish Sword Sage’s enemy.
 That ancient deity did not attack now that the Foolish Sword Sage had attained the Great Dao Supreme again. He had probably let go of karma.
 Han Jue opened his eyes after the dream ended.
 A hundred years later.
 The lecture ended.
 Han Jue wanted to continue cultivating, but after thinking about it, he still headed to the 33rd Heaven. He directly entered the Universal Hall.
 Only Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du and Lao Dan were in the hall.
 Lao Dan opened his eyes and sized him up, looking surprised.
 Han Jue’s treasures were not simple!
 His temperament was even more impressive.
 Lao Dan inexplicably thought of Laozi.
 Han Jue nodded slightly at Lao Dan to show his courtesy. Then, he said to Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du, “Gather all the Sages for a meeting. The Sages of the Hidden Sect will also be called over.”
 Although he was no longer afraid of the Divine Authority Generals, he still had to make his stance clear to prevent some Sages from acting recklessly because they were too afraid.
 It was normal for Sages to be afraid of death. At least, Han Jue could understand.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du was stunned. Then, he immediately sent a voice transmission to gather the Sages.
 Before long…
 South Extreme Heavenly Venerate, Sect Master Tian Jue, Emperor Xiao, Heavenly Venerate Wufa, Qiu Xilai, Fang Liang, Jin Shen, Pan Xin, Xu Dudao, Su Qi, Li Taigu, Primordial Chaos Buddha, Zhang Guxing, Long Hao, Ji Xianshen, Divine Might Buddha, Yang Che, Tai Sutian, Tian Zhan, Han Yu, Qin Ling, Xia Zhizun, World Salvation Buddha, Dao Sovereign, Zhao Xuanyuan, and Jiang Yi all arrived.
 Lao Dan looked at the number of Sages and became dazed.
 Even the Human School in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End did not have so many Sages.
 At first, he did not feel anything, but after all the Sages arrived, the shock was still very strong
 The Sages became excited when they saw Han Jue.
 The Divine Might Heavenly Sage was the Heavenly Dao’s greatest trump card!
 Lao Dan stood up and prepared to leave.
 Lao Dan was moved and sat back down. He also wanted to hear what Han Jue had to say.
 Han Jue was the first to speak, “The matter of the Divine Authority Generals has been in everyone’s mind recently. Although I’m in seclusion, I’ve also heard that the Divine Authority Generals not only want to destroy the Chaotic Fiendcelestials but also the Heavenly Dao created by Pangu is also in their target range. This means that the Heavenly Dao will fight the Divine Authority Generals.
 “I hereby express that this battle must be fought.”
 He spoke very slowly and softly, but the words were heavy.
 He had to fight!
 The Sages were excited.
 Although the Sages had temporarily reached a consensus, they were still afraid of the Divine Authority Generals.
  Han Jue continued, “The Heavenly Dao has no backing ever since it restarted. It’s all thanks to us Sages, the Heavenly Devil Calamity, the Flame Race Calamity, the Calamity Race’s Calamity, the Divine Spirit Calamity, and so on. When has the Heavenly Dao ever relied on the Chaos?
 “So what if they’re the Divine Authority Generals? In the past, when have we not been in desperate situations?
 “Besides, the Divine Authority Generals’ opponents are not only the Heavenly Dao but also the Chaotic Fiendcelestials. We are not alone in this battle. I hope that all the Sages can calm down and stabilize the Heavenly Dao. Who in the Chaos will dare to provoke the Heavenly Dao in the future if we win?
 “How can the Chaos tolerate us if the Heavenly Dao is gone? How can we be slaves in other worlds?”
 Han Jue stared at the Sages and spoke firmly.
 The Sages were all excited. Thinking back to the past, it was indeed not easy, but they survived!
 It was not that Han Jue’s words were beautiful, but mainly because of his determination, as if he could definitely survive this calamity!
 Who did not know that the Divine Might Heavenly Sage had unparalleled potential and had never lost?


 The other Sages also began to express their stance.
 Pan Xin laughed. “It’s been a long time since we last fought. I hope the Divine Authority Generals can fight us!”
 “What are we afraid of with the Divine Might Heavenly Sage on our side?”
 “Although we are new Sages, we are not afraid of battle!”
 “This battle can show the Heavenly Dao’s power to the Chaos!”
 “Tsk tsk, the Exquisite World invited me, but I rejected them without any hesitation!”
 “When will the Divine Authority Generals arrive? You make me want to fight now!”
 The Sages spoke one after another, and the atmosphere was agitated.
  Han Jue glanced at Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du. He understood and took over the authority. He began to summarize the recent development of the Heavenly Dao and deployed the space around it.
 Lao Dan, Dao Sovereign, Zhao Xuanyuan, and Jiang Yi listened quietly. Their feelings were very different.
 He did not expect the Heavenly Dao Sages to be so harmonious!
 At first glance, it was even more harmonious than the discussion of fellow disciples. There were no conflicts of interest.
 ......
 Lao Dan sighed. “This Divine Might Heavenly Sage has some methods. He doesn’t only know how to enter seclusion.”
 He felt that Han Jue might have threatened the Sages in private. Otherwise, how could they be so harmonious?
 Dao Sovereign and the other two were even more proud.
 The Heavenly Dao already belonged to the Hidden Sect!
 No wonder Han Jue didn’t deliberately develop the Hidden Sect. He had already occupied a high-rise building, so the development of the grassroots was naturally casual.
 After Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du finished instructing, Han Jue said, “I’ve roped in two Great Dao Sages. One of them will bring their world here. At that time, they will be distributed near the Heavenly Dao. They will develop with the Heavenly Dao and help each other in the future.”
 The Sages were shocked.
 Two Great Dao Sages?
 They already knew of Great Sage Void Soul’s existence. With two more, wouldn’t there be four Great Dao Sages?
 The Sages enslaved by the Primordial Heavenly Prison thought of the Divine Robe Daoist. There were five of them!
 Li Taigu said excitedly, “Senior Han is really powerful. In that case, we have more confidence in resisting the Divine Authority Generals!”
 The other Sages flattered Han Jue sincerely.
 Xia Zhizun and the World Salvation Buddha didn’t know much about the Great Dao Sage Realm, but they knew that it was two major realms higher than them. Definitely unfathomable. They looked at Han Jue with reverence.
 Zhang Guxing looked at the calm Han Jue with mixed emotions.
 He recalled the Sword Dao River.
 At that time, he had never thought that this would happen.
 It felt like a dream.
 He understood one thing. Meeting Han Jue and showing goodwill was the greatest opportunity in his life.
 If not for Han Jue, how could he have been elected as a Sage?
 Han Jue stood up and said, “In short, everyone, manage the Heavenly Dao well. I will definitely take action when the Divine Authority Generals arrive. There’s no need to panic. As for your connection with other worlds, grasp it well and choose a good path. I can let bygones be bygones, but I don’t want to see it a second time.”
 With that, Han Jue disappeared.
 The Sages looked at each other and heaved a sigh of relief.
 Xu Dudao looked at Yang Che and said in a strange tone, “Be careful.”
 Yang Che snorted. “You too.”
 Idiot!
 I’m already a loyal servant of the Divine Might Heavenly Sage. How can he hurt me? Pan Xin looked at Jin Shen and said, ‘We have to hurry up on the second Chaotic Heavenly Road. Choose one side from the alliance of a hundred worlds as the end.”
 Jin Shen nodded.
 The other Sages also chatted.
 Lao Dan looked at Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du and said, “The Divine Might Heavenly Sage is indeed impressive. It seems that you didn’t choose blindly.”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du replied, “Following Fellow Daoist Han is at least responsible and not inactive.”
 Lao Dan frowned.
 The two of them spoke without restraint. The other Sages heard it, but they pretended not to.
 They knew very well that Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du was expressing his loyalty to the Divine Might Heavenly Sage!
 Han Jue sat on the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus after returning to the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 He did not cultivate immediately. Instead, he looked at the Supreme Treasure Fusion Cauldron in the Myriad Worlds Projection.
 He had too many Dharma treasures in the system. It was time to fuse them.
 The first thing he thought of was the Primordial Judgment Sword.
 The Heaven-Opening Axe was still Pangu’s weapon no matter how impressive it was.
 The Primordial Judgment Sword was Han Jue’s Birth Dharma treasure and was paired with the Primordial Fiendcelestial. However, its realm had always been lower than his cultivation realm, so it had always been stored in his warehouse.
 The Supreme Treasure Fusion Cauldron could fuse all Dharma treasures. This might be able to help the Primordial Judgment Sword.
 Han Jue waved his hand and took out all his Dharma treasures.
 Qilin Sword, Demon Binding Rope, Burning Fiend Bell, Heart Protecting Immortal Chain, Calm Meditation Mat, Heavenly Spirit Bracelet, Purple Gold Soft Armor, God Slayer Sword, Heaven and Earth Primordial Sword, Nine Elements Ten Thousand Life Sword, and so on.
 He suddenly had a bold thought.
 Should he also fuse the Heaven-Opening Axe into the Primordial Judgment Sword?
 He asked in his mind, “Will I lose control of the Primordial Judgment Sword if I fuse the Heaven-Opening Axe into it?”
 [No]
 “Then, can the Primordial Judgment Sword surpass an Ultimate Dao Treasure?”
 [Possible]
 Only a possibility?
 Han Jue hesitated for a moment and started the fusion.
 The Supreme Treasure Fusion Cauldron was not a physical object but a function. Han Jue let the system do it.
 Dozens of Dharma treasures fused into the Primordial Judgment Sword, including the Heaven-Opening Axe.
 The main item was the Primordial Judgment Sword. The product would still look like this sword after the fusion.
 (Do you want to start the fusion?]
 Yes!
 Do you need to make sure? Are you afraid that I’ll act recklessly when I’m drunk?
 Han Jue found it funny.
 [Fusion begins. Please wait patiently.]
 It involved an Ultimate Dao Treasure and would probably take some time.
 Han Jue was not in a hurry and began to meditate and cultivate.
 In the Pangu Hall.
 Pan Xin opened his eyes in the middle of his meditation.
 He sensed carefully and could not figure it out.
 He suddenly thought of a possibility.
 “Could it be that the Heaven-Opening Axe is calling me?” Pan Xin frowned. After all, he had used the Heaven-Opening Axe for a period of time.
 However, he couldn’t find it.
  “Damn it, I’ll kill all of you sooner or later!”
 Pan Xin thought hatefully. He could only try his best not to think about it.
 In the Dark Forbidden Zone, a majestic pagoda was advancing. Countless cultivators gathered around it, as well as Chaotic Beasts. It was unstoppable.
 Zhou Fan had his arms crossed as he looked ahead. It was dark, but he could already see the Heavenly Dao.
 “We’re finally going back,” Zhou Fan muttered to himself and smiled.
 Mo Fuchou stood beside him and asked curiously, “We’re almost there?”
 Zhou Fan nodded.
 Mo Fuchou looked expectant.
 He had been thinking about the Heavenly Dao after reviving. He had been very confused when he learned that he had been revived in the Chaos. He felt out of place. Everything was like a dream. Only now that he was returning to the Heavenly Dao did he feel that he was really alive.


 “I wonder if the Jade Pure Sacred Sect is still around,” Mo Fuchou muttered to himself.
 Zhou Fan rolled his eyes.
 Zhou Fan said, “It should still be there. The Hidden Sect disciples mentioned that the Reroll World, where the Jade Pure Sacred Sect is located, is the second mortal world of the Heavenly Dao. The Jade Pure Sacred Sect is also the number one sect in the Reroll World.”
 Mo Fuchou smiled. “So powerful? It seems that our Jade Pure Sacred Sect is really lucky.”
 Zhou Fan curled his lips. How was the Jade Pure Sacred Sect powerful? It was clearly because of Han Jue.
 He didn’t dare to look down on him. After all, he was also benefiting from him.
 The two of them chatted as they waited for the Great Dao Tower to reach the Heavenly Dao.
 At the edge of the Heavenly Dao, Fang Liang had already begun to wait and was in charge of receiving the Great Dao Tower.
  After all, the Great Dao Tower led many cultivators. They had to make arrangements, or it would easily cause panic.
 The news that Zhou Fan was a disciple of the Hidden Sect also spread, revealing the Hidden Sect’s foundation to the Heavenly Dao cultivators.
 ......
 The Hidden Sect had always been a major force in the Immortal World, but it kept a low profile and rarely fought for great providence. Usually, cultivators would find it difficult to think of them.
 Because of the Great Dao Tower, all living beings began to dig up information about the Hidden Sect. The more they understood, the more shocked they became.
 Year after year passed.
 Forty thousand years later.
 On this day, a notification appeared in front of Han Jue.
 [Fusion successful. Primordial Judgment Sword has been upgraded to an Ultimate Dao Treasure.]
 Han Jue was a little disappointed.
 However, it was impossible upon thinking about it carefully. Other than the Heaven-Opening Axe, the grade of the other Dharma treasures was not enough.
 Han Jue hurriedly used his Supreme Power to control it.
 The Primordial Judgment Sword was his Birth Dharma treasure, to begin with. He did not need to refine it again.
 Han Jue began to sense the Primordial Judgment Sword’s power and fused it with his will.
 Unlike the Heaven-Opening Axe, Han Jue felt extremely close to the Primordial Judgment Sword. He could easily mobilize all the power it contained!
 After a long time.
 Han Jue began the simulation trial to familiarize himself with the Primordial Judgment Sword.
 A hundred thousand Foolish Sword Sages!
 Han Jue fused the 1,949 Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols into his body and used the Primordial Divine Rage to slash out.
 He killed them all!
 Han Jue was pleasantly surprised.
 The Primordial Judgment Sword was even more ferocious than the previous Heaven-Opening Axe!
 Apart from the killing intent of the Heaven-Opening Axe, there was also the power of Primordial Chaos. When fused together, it truly displayed the power of an Ultimate Dao Treasure.
 Han Jue’s strength suddenly increased after acquiring the new Primordial Judgment Sword.
 Indeed, Dharma treasures were also very important!
 Pangu could fight against three thousand Fiendcelestials with the Heaven-Opening Axe!
 He could only fight dozens of Fiendcelestials without it!
 Of course, this was also related to Pangu’s cultivation.
 Two hundred thousand Foolish Sword Sages!
 This time, Han Jue felt a suffocating pressure.
 After fighting for a long time, he finally killed all 200,000 Foolish Sword Sages.
 He frowned.
 He was still far from being invincible!
 After all, he was still a realm higher. Facing the Foolish Sword Sage, he actually killed as many as came.
  Han Jue sighed and opened his eyes.
 He suddenly felt an aura.
 The Foolish Sword Sage’s aura!
 At this moment, the Foolish Sword Sage was staying in the Great Dao Tower.
 When did this fellow arrive?
 Han Jue was vigilant. He had been careless.
 He immediately used the simulation trial to test the Foolish Sword Sage and copied his data again.
 Then, he began the simulation trial again.
 One-on-one, insta-kill!
 A hundred Foolish Sword Sages were insta-killed!
 A thousand Foolish Sword Sages took ten breaths of time.
 Han Jue continued fighting. After several rounds, he found a way to insta-kill a thousand Foolish Sword Sages.
 The battle became difficult after he increased the number to ten thousand Foolish Sword Sages.
 Han Jue discovered that the Foolish Sword Sage was indeed much stronger than before, but there was not much difference.
 Perhaps the previous Foolish Sword Sage had already attained the Great Dao Supreme Realm. He could also show the level of a half-step Great Dao Supreme with his perfected Great Dao Primordial Chaos Realm cultivation.
 The Foolish Sword Sage had said that he could fight a hundred Divine Authority Generals. In other words, Han Jue could kill a million Divine Authority Generals?
 In that case, the Divine Authority Generals were not worth mentioning.
 It was also possible that the Foolish Sword Sage was bragging.
 Han Jue thought carefully. The reason he was so much stronger than a Great Dao Supreme of the same realm was all thanks to the Grand Unity Aspect and the Stellar Primordial Body. The Grand Unity Aspect allowed him to have nearly two thousand helpers, and they could also fuse into his body. It was equivalent to increasing his strength by two thousand times in battle!
 Of course, other cultivators would not be able to withstand two thousand idols of the Grand Unity Aspect. Because of the non-coexistence of the Great Dao, it might be difficult for them to cultivate more than one Great Dao power.
 Seven Dao Sage was something. He had actually grasped seven Great Dao.
 Han Jue thought of the Seven Dao Sage and suddenly felt that he might be someone with great providence. If not for him, with his methods and potential, he might have grown into Laozi or an even stronger existence.
 Unfortunately, he was courting death and insisted on finding trouble with Han Jue.
 After thinking, Han Jue put away the Primordial Judgment Sword and stood up to see the Foolish Sword Sage.
 He wouldn’t die even if the Foolish Sword Sage ambushed him.
 As for whether the Chaotic Consciousness would attack, Han Jue was not worried. He could spy on the entire Chaos. He could discover it immediately if the Seven Supreme Rules and the three thousand Great Dao fluctuated.
 In addition, he had left a trace of will in the Daoist temple. He could be instantly revived in the Daoist temple even if he died.
 It was very safe!
 It was perfect!
 At the top of the Great Dao Tower.
 Zhou Fan, who was already a Freedom Sage, did not sense the Foolish Sword Sage above his head.
 The two sides were less than fifty feet apart. They were so close, but Zhou Fan couldn’t discover him. It was enough to show the difference between the Great Dao Supreme Realm and the Freedom Sage Realm.
 Han Jue suddenly appeared behind Zhou Fan and snorted. “Don’t be a peeping tom. Haven’t you heard?”
 Zhou Fan opened his eyes and hurriedly turned around to bow to him.
 “Master, what peeping tom?” Zhou Fan asked carefully.
 This was his territory. What was there to peep
 on?
 Foolish Sword Sage smiled. “I’m just curious about the Great Dao Tower. Back then, I also had a relationship with the Seven Dao Sage.”
  Zhou Fan suddenly looked up, trembling in
 fear.
 There was actually someone above him!
 Zhou Fan was instantly filled with fear.
 When did the other party arrive?
 He actually did not sense anything!
 The Foolish Sword Sage landed and looked at Han Jue. “I can’t see through you. It seems that I’m still not your match.”
 His tone was intriguing, but Han Jue heard a hint of unwillingness.
 You can’t defeat me!
 Even ten thousand of you are not my match!


 “You’re alone?” Han Jue asked. He didn’t mind the Foolish Sword Sage’s offense towards Zhou Fan. After all, he didn’t hurt him.
 The Foolish Sword Sage said, “I once created a world. Later, I felt that it was cumbersome and abandoned it. The world perished in less than ten billion years.”
 He spoke casually as if that world had nothing to do with him.
 Zhou Fan frowned.
 However, the mention of ten billion years caused him not to dare to be hostile.
 To be able to live for ten billion years, who knew how strong he was.
 Han Jue said, “I’ll arrange a place for you to stay. Don’t disturb the Heavenly Dao lifeforms casually.”
 Foolish Sword Sage snorted. “Don’t worry. There’s nothing else in the Heavenly Dao that makes me curious other than the Great Dao Tower.”
 Zhou Fan became nervous.
  Han Jue said, “Don’t think about the Great Dao Tower. This is my disciple’s Supreme Treasure.”
 “I understand. I don’t have to snatch treasures from juniors. Let’s go. Lead the way.”
 “Mm.”
 ......
 The two of them disappeared from the hall.
 Zhou Fan was relieved and curious about who that person was.
 On the other side.
 “Foolish Sword Sage…”
 Sect Master Tian Jue took the initiative and instantly became respectful.
 Clearly, he had heard of this name.
 Han Jue looked at the Foolish Sword Sage and said, “You can stay here and cultivate in the future.”
 The Foolish Sword Sage nodded.
 He turned around and walked to a corner to meditate.
 Han Jue left after instructing Sect Master Tian Jue.
 The Foolish Sword Sage’s arrival quickly spread to the Sages, making them believe Han Jue’s words even more.
 He could really rope in a Great Dao Sage!
 Twenty thousand years later.
 Red Fate arrived. She opened her right hand and released a vast world that landed beside the Heavenly Dao. It was almost half the size of the Immortal World.
 Red Fate took the initiative to negotiate with Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du and explained that she was invited by Han Jue.
 The Sages were excited. Another Great Dao Sage had arrived!
 Not only that, but she also brought a world!
 This world was so vast that it naturally attracted the attention of the Heavenly Dao cultivators. The news could not be hidden.
 For a time, the situation in the Immortal World changed. All sorts of rumors circulated.
 …
 In the blink of an eye.
 Han Jue entered seclusion for another fifty thousand years.
 Han Jue’s cultivation speed decreased again after reaching the Great Dao Supreme Realm. Not only was his cultivation speed slow, but he also suddenly lost his sense of direction.
 He didn’t know how to cultivate.
 He opened his eyes and began to stabilize his Dao heart.
 One could definitely cultivate in the Great Dao Supreme Realm. It was definitely not stagnant.
 What should he care about?
 Han Jue’s gaze landed on the Primordial World.
 Previously, it was to refine stars. What should he do now?
 Han Jue began to try various methods. The stars had already reached their limits and could no longer be refined with Supreme Power. The nebulous Primordial Qi had already transformed into a Primordial Space and was very stable. It could no longer be improved.
 After countless attempts, Han Jue finally found the method.
 Expansion of the Primordial World!
  This method needed to open up the space in the soul and let it constantly expand. The Primordial Space would expand as well, causing an endless stream of nebulous Primordial Qi to be born and connect to the Primordial Space.
 Han Jue’s cultivation level would also increase as the nebulous Primordial Qi increased.
 He didn’t know if the expansion of the Primordial World had a limit, but he could cultivate for now.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and sent a dream to Red Fate. They chatted for a while and finally met.
 Red Fate had already settled down. With the help of the Sages, the Heavenly Dao cultivators did not find trouble with the Red Fate World.
 Han Jue checked the emails after the dream ended.
 After so many years, he didn’t know how his friends were doing. Han Jue could directly observe them, but that was too troublesome. The emails were more interesting.
 (Your grand-disciple Chu Shiren was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure.]
 (Your son Han Tuo has returned to the Chaos.]
 (Your good friend Yi Tian has returned to the Chaos.]
 [Your good friend Jiang Jueshi was attacked]
 X19
 (Your good friend Di Jiang has received guidance from your good friend Pangu. His cultivation has increased greatly.] [Your good friend Empress Houtu has received guidance from your good friend Pangu. Her cultivation has increased greatly.)
 [Your good friend Huang Zuntian has fused with the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority. His cultivation has increased greatly.]
 (Your good friend Divine Lord Peacock was attacked by the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority and was severely injured.)
 [Your good friend Divine Robe Daoist was cursed by a mysterious curse.]
 Han Tuo and Yi Tian had returned?
 It seemed that the Great Dao Divine Spirits had been careless recently.
 The meeting between the twelve Ancestral Magi and Pangu was a sign that the battle was about to begin.
 Han Jue didn’t plan to interfere in the battle between the Chaotic Fiendcelestial and the Divine Authority Generals.
 After all, both sides were his enemies.
 Once his identity was exposed, the Chaotic Fiendcelestials would definitely join forces to deal with him. It was better to let them fight to the death before he harvested the Divine Authority Generals.
 As for the consequences of killing the Divine Authority Generals, Han Jue didn’t have much of a burden. The Hidden Sect disciples had already returned one after another. He could just take all the disciples back to the Dao Field if he really angered the Chaotic Deities.
 However, he felt that the Chaotic Deities would not attack. He was an existence higher than the Chaos, and Han Jue was defending himself. How could the Chaotic Deities attack?
 In addition, Han Jue still had Pangu as his backing
 The current resurrected Pangu was only a clone. Pangu’s main body was still around even if he was destroyed.
 Could Pangu stand by and watch if the Chaotic Deities dared to attack the Heavenly Dao?
 Han Jue had a feeling that Pangu was not much weaker than the Chaotic Fiendcelestials.
 There was also the mysterious and unknown Dao Ancestor.
 These two were the true backing of the Heavenly Dao.
 Han Jue sent a dream to Divine Lord Peacock after reading the emails.
 This fellow had not been careful recently and was injured again!
 Could the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority that attacked him be a Divine Authority General?
 Han Jue met Divine Lord Peacock in the image of the Dark Forbidden Lord.
 Divine Lord Peacock opened his eyes and saw Han Jue. He immediately looked awkward.
 The Dark Forbidden Lord would visit him in his dreams every time he was injured. Although it was out of concern, it also made him lose face.
 Divine Lord Peacock hurriedly said, “This time, I wasn’t defeated by someone at the same realm, much less suppressed by a Great Dao Sage. It was a Divine Authority General!
  “Ten thousand Divine Authority Generals are too strong! One of them casually glared at me and I almost lost my soul!”
 Speaking of this, Divine Lord Peacock still shivered when he thought about it.
 He had never encountered such a terrifying thing.
 Han Jue asked, “When will you attain the Great Dao?”
 Divine Lord Peacock replied, “Soon, soon. I’ve already been checked by the Divine Authority Generals. I can cultivate in peace now. Legend has it that the Divine Authority is about to destroy the Chaotic Fiendcelestials, the Heavenly Dao, and the mysterious Primordial Fiendcelestial. Is that true?”
 Han Jue said, “I don’t know. It doesn’t matter as long as you’re safe.”
 “What do you think of the Divine Authority Generals?” Divine Lord Peacock asked carefully. There were various opinions regarding the Dark Forbidden Lord’s identity. Some time ago, because of a sentence before the death of the First Life Black Sovereign, the Chaotic living beings thought that the Dark Forbidden Lord was a Great Dao Divine Spirit.
 Han Jue said, “It’s just a trigger of the Chaotic Rule. It has nothing to do with us. Don’t ask and don’t think too much.”
 Divine Lord Peacock immediately had many guesses.
 Han Jue instructed, “Hurry up and attain the Great Dao. I’ll be forced to reevaluate your potential if you’re injured before attaining the Dao.”


 Divine Lord Peacock agreed immediately, but he was panicking inside.
 He also felt embarrassed. His performance in the past two million years was far inferior to the past. It made him look like he was bragging
 Han Jue didn’t say anything else and directly removed the dream.
 Realizing that he had returned to reality, Han Jue began to observe the Heavenly Dao.
 Two more Sage positions appeared in the Heavenly Dao after the calamity ended. Han Jue didn’t plan to interfere and let nature take its course.
 Han Jue looked at the Chaos next.
 He captured the ten thousand Divine Authority Generals advancing in the Chaos. They were still far from the Heavenly Dao, but they were already very close to the Grand Primordium Domain.
 Dozens of Chaotic Fiendcelestials gathered in the Grand Primordium Domain, including Pangu.
  After reviving, Pangu’s aura was not inferior to before. The other living beings in the Grand Primordium Domain had already been dispersed, leaving only the Fiendcelestials waiting for the final battle.
 The Divine Authority Generals seemed to sense the Chaotic Fiendcelestials and deliberately approached the Grand Primordium Domain.
 Han Jue looked forward to this battle.
 Han Jue retracted his gaze and continued cultivating after watching for a while.
 ......
 Deep in the Chaos, in the Dark Forbidden Zone.
 A beam of light sped away.
 It was Jiang Jueshi.
 Jiang Jueshi suddenly stopped and looked forward with a sharp gaze. The dark space fluctuated and a figure slowly walked out.
 Ancestor Xitian!
 Jiang Jueshi asked, “Why did the ancestor only appear after chasing me here?”
 Ancestor Xitian said expressionlessly, “You know very well that I’ll leave after saying a few words. Just pretend that I didn’t catch up to you.”
 Jiang Jueshi frowned and fell into confusion.
 He had never been able to figure out Ancestor Xitian. It seemed that he had been captured by him, but all these years, Ancestor Xitian had provided him with a safe cultivation environment.
 He felt that Ancestor Xitian had entered Life with ulterior motives.
 In his opinion, the Chaos was not lively. On the contrary, it was lonely. It was rare to see a living being in hundreds of years. Under such circumstances, his potential was easily spied on?
 Jiang Jueshi fell into self-doubt. Could it be that the Chaos was really more terrifying than he had imagined? Were there many eyes staring at him?
 The more he thought about it, the more afraid he became.
 He had indeed been careless.
 After all, reincarnation for hundreds of thousands of years was too long.
 Ancestor Xitian continued, “The future Heavenly Dao still needs you to save it. I’ll teach you the Great Dao of Karma before I leave.”
 He waved his sleeve, and a ball of light quickly entered Jiang Jueshi’s forehead, preventing him from reacting.
 Jiang Jueshi was stunned. Ancestor Xitian was already gone when he opened his eyes again.
 He did not stay in place and quickly left.
 In the darkness, a majestic golden Buddha dragged a world with one hand. It was the Sacred True Martial Buddha.
 The Heavenly Dao was already ahead.
 Sacred True Martial Buddha’s gaze landed on the Red Fate World. He was slightly moved.
 Chu Shiren’s voice floated into his ears. “Don’t worry. That’s a Great Dao Sage invited by my Grandmaster. The Buddhist World is to position itself on the other side of the Immortal World, forming a defensive formation on both sides.”
 Sacred True Martial Buddha immediately stopped asking when Chu Shiren mentioned his Grandmaster. He circled around the Heavenly Dao and arrived on the other side of the Immortal World.
 Sages appeared one after another and looked curiously at the Sacred True Martial Buddha.
  Fang Liang had already revealed that the Buddhist World was also moving here. They were already looking forward to it.
 The Sages introduced themselves.
 Sacred True Martial Buddha did not put on airs. He knew that he had to stay near the Heavenly Dao for a long time. They might also fuse together in the future.
 He did not resist. Instead, he was very satisfied.
 It was indeed difficult for him to rely on the Buddhist World alone. The Immortal World was different. He would die even if a Great Dao Divine Spirit attacked.
 The Sacred True Martial Buddha chatted politely with the Sages.
 Ten thousand years later, after discussion by the Sages, they began to arrange for Heavenly Dao cultivators to go to the Buddhist World and the Red Fate World. They would first spread the providence of the Heavenly Dao. Under the accumulation of time, they would fuse with the Heavenly Dao sooner or later.
 Red Fate and Sacred True Martial Buddha had no objections.
 The Heavenly Dao was not afraid of the Divine Authority Generals!
 The Foolish Sword Sage had fought Pangu twice and survived. His reputation had long shaken the Chaos.
 It was as if the Divine Authority Generals would no longer target the Heavenly Dao.
 This situation made the Sages very happy. At the same time, they were glad that they did not leave the Heavenly Dao.
 Inside the Daoist temple.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and frowned.
 He had been in seclusion for another fifty thousand years and his cultivation level had increased greatly. The Primordial World had already nearly doubled in size. It was not bad. As the Primordial World increased, the distance between the stars also increased. They began to develop meteors, which was quite magical. Han Jue habitually checked his emails.
 The wait for the Divine Authority Generals was a little boring.

 Soon, Han Jue was attracted by an email.

 He continued reading and saw another related email.

 [Your good friend Evil Heavenly Emperor was attacked by the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority. His body was destroyed, leaving only a remnant soul.]
 So tragic?
 Han Jue’s heart tightened, and he immediately sent a dream to the Evil Heavenly Emperor.
 The dream was the forest back then.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor opened his eyes and heaved a sigh of relief when he saw that it was Han Jue.
 “Your Majesty, have you encountered a Divine Authority General recently?” Han Jue asked.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor smiled bitterly. “That’s right, but I’m fine. I’ve long escaped the providence of the Heavenly Dao and am not a Heavenly Dao lifeform.”
 Han Jue was relieved after hearing that.
  The Evil Heavenly Emperor said, “You’re preparing to deal with the Divine Authority Generals? I’ve heard of the Heavenly Dao’s situation. It hasn’t collapsed yet and is even constantly absorbing mighty figures. Are you going to fight?”
 Han Jue felt that there was nothing to hide and nodded. “It’s our duty to protect the Heavenly Dao.”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor clicked his tongue in wonder. “I’m beginning to suspect that you’re not a Chaotic Fiendcelestial. The Divine Authority Generals are about to suffer.”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor was shocked and looked at Han Jue in disbelief.
 He knew him too well.
 This kid would not guard the Heavenly Dao to his death. It was obvious that he was confident!
 Han Jue felt a chill down his spine.
 Fortunately, the Evil Heavenly Emperor knew his limits and didn’t continue to guess Han Jue’s identity.
 What was higher than the Chaotic Fiendcelestial’s potential?
 “By the way, I met an acquaintance among the Divine Authority Generals. The Dao Ancestor. He’s also one of the Divine Authority Generals!” The Evil Heavenly Emperor changed the topic and said with a dark expression.
