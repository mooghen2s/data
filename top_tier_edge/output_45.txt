 The green-robed Daoist nodded, but he was still kneeling. His attitude and words were very different.
 The Divine Robe Daoist suddenly felt a terrifying sense of danger. It was even more terrifying than when he faced Han Jue.
 The Divine Robe Daoist asked in a low voice, “Where are you from?”
 He had lived for countless years, but he had never seen these people.
 “The Chaos is endless. Even the Exalted God might not understand the entire Chaos,” the green-robed Daoist said softly. He looked up at the Divine Robe Daoist with a calm gaze.
 The Divine Robe Daoist had no choice but to face them.
 “Why do you want to kill the Divine Might Heavenly Sage?” The Divine Robe Daoist asked.
 The green-robed Daoist said, “Because he’s famous. In this area of the Chaos, it’s difficult to find someone more famous than him. We can only confirm that he’s in the Heavenly Dao.”
  The Divine Robe Daoist frowned. “Just for fame?”
 For some reason, the Divine Robe Daoist panicked.
Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates He knew that it would not end well if he rejected them.
 ......
 However, he was loyal to Han Jue. How could he harm him?
 “This matter is impossible to fulfill. All of you can leave,” the Divine Robe Daoist said indifferently. His robes fluttered slightly.
 The green-robed Daoist revealed a helpless expression and stood up. “Since you’re unwilling, I can only kill you to show my might.”
 The Divine Robe Daoist smiled. “How arrogant. Show me your Supreme Treasure!”
 The green-robed Daoist nodded, and the dozens of figures behind him stood up.
 Time passed quickly.
 Fifty thousand years passed.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and looked satisfied.
 He was already used to entering seclusion for fifty thousand years every time. Only then could he feel his cultivation level increase.
 Han Jue checked the emails.
 (Your son Han Tuo has obtained the providence of a god.)
 (Your good friend Yi Tian has obtained the providence of a god.)
 (Your disciple Dao Sovereign was attacked by ancient demons] x8021643
 (Your disciple Zhao Xuanyuan…)
 (Your good friend Di Jiang was attacked by your good friend Heavenly Lord of Primordial Beginning.)
 (Your grand-disciple Chu Shiren has stepped into the Origin World.]
 (Your good friend Divine Robe Daoist was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure and was severely injured.)
 What did Han Tuo and Yi Tian do to obtain the providence of the Divine Spirits?
 Could it be that these two had stepped onto the Divine Dao?
 Were they about to succeed?
 He did not interfere. His descendants had their own fate.
 Han Jue prepared to continue cultivating after he finished reading the emails.
 At this moment, Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du sent him a voice transmission, inviting him to the Universal Hall.
 Han Jue stood up and came to the Universal Hall. The Dao Seekers in the hall had already been dispersed, leaving only Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du didn’t summon the other Sages but stayed alone with Han Jue.
 “Something happened to the Divine Robe Daoist,” Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said softly. After saying that, he examined his expression.
 Han Jue asked, “Really?”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “The Divine Robe Daoist was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure called Dao God Qing Xiao and almost died.”
 Dao God Qing Xiao?
 Han Jue asked, “What about Dao God Qing Xiao? Is there any information on this person?”
  Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du shook his head. “I’ve never heard of him. I’ve asked Teacher, but I don’t know. The Chaos is unpredictable. The Heavenly Dao indeed has to be careful. It looks powerful, but it’s too tiny in the Chaos.’
 Han Jue said, “Why did you tell me this?”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du was stunned and did not know how to answer.
 He noticed Han Jue’s thoughtful expression and smiled faintly.
 In an instant, Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du felt an unprecedented pressure that terrified him.
 He forced a smile and said, “After all, the Divine Robe Daoist has been seeking many benefits for the Heavenly Dao recently. It might implicate the Heavenly Dao if anything happens to him. We don’t know what that Dao God Qing Xiao’s goal is.”
 “Really?”
 “Mm.”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du pretended to be calm.
 Han Jue said, “I understand. I’ll deal with it. Is there anything else?” He knew how to deal with it!
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du secretly heaved a sigh of relief.
 Indeed, he was right. The Divine Robe Daoist was already Han Jue’s subordinate.
 Perhaps the Divine Robe Daoist had always been Han Jue’s subordinate?
 Then, why did the Divine Robe Daoist attack the Heavenly Dao?
 Could it be…
 I can’t think like that!
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “Han Tuo and Yi Tian obtained two positions.”
 Han Jue nodded.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du stopped talking.
 Han Jue immediately stood up and left.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du heaved a sigh of relief after he left.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du thought to himself.
 He felt that Han Jue was not coveting the Heavenly Dao. His plan was too big. His disciples had already made a name for themselves in the Chaos and established their own factions.
 The Heavenly Dao might only be Han Jue’s shield to hide his true ambitions.
 “Indeed, no one who can cultivate to this point is easy to deal with. None of them are truly without schemes.”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du sighed.
 Han Jue sent a dream to the Divine Robe Daoist after returning to the Daoist temple.
 In the dream, the Divine Robe Daoist opened his eyes. Seeing that it was him, he immediately knelt down and bowed.
 “Tell me, why were you attacked?” Han Jue asked.
 The Divine Robe Daoist did not hide anything and told him everything that had happened.
 Han Jue frowned. He didn’t expect this Dao God Qing Xiao to look for him. The Divine Robe Daoist was injured to protect him.
 “Dao God Qing Xiao’s Supreme Treasure is indeed powerful. It can freeze my Daoist temple and make me unable to resist. Perhaps he’s afraid of the Great Dao Divine Spirit’s identity, so he didn’t kill me. Otherwise, I would have died very quickly,” the Divine Robe Daoist said in a low voice. Speaking of this, he still had a lingering fear.
 Han Jue asked, “What cultivation level is the other party at? Has he surpassed the Great Dao Sage Realm?”
 The Divine Robe Daoist said in shame, “I’m not sure, either. I was subdued by his Supreme Treasure before I could sense his Dharmic powers.”
 Han Jue said, “Alright, cultivate well. You can visit me in my dreams if you encounter such a thing next time. There’s no need to force yourself.”
 “Alright!”
 With that said, the dream shattered.
  Han Jue opened his eyes and didn’t lose his indifferent expression. Instead, he smiled excitedly.
 Perfect timing!
 I just broke through!
 Although the simulation trial could vent his desire to fight, it was not real.
 Han Jue asked in his mind, “Can I insta-kill this Dao God Qing Xiao?”
 (300 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 He hesitated.
 300 billion years was the value of inferring the Foolish Sword Sage.
 How dare he try to kill Han Jue with this level of strength?
 What was he thinking?!


 Be careful.
 In any case, he had a long lifespan and was not afraid of wasting it.
 Han Jue chose to continue.
 [Yes, but there is also a possibility of failure.)
 Han Jue showed a frown.
 How could he fail?
 Could it be related to the other party’s Supreme Treasure?
 Han Jue couldn’t use the simulation trial without detecting Dao God Qing Xiao first.
  He sighed. He could only take out the Book of Misfortune.
 In any case, Dao God Qing Xiao only attacked the Divine Robe Daoist. The outside world thought that the Divine Robe Daoist and Han Jue were enemies.
 Without another word, he started cursing Dao God Qing Xiao.
 Previously, he already knew Dao God Qing Xiao’s appearance from the Divine Robe Daoist. Coupled with his cultivation and name, he could accurately capture it in karma.
 ......
 He cursed with all his might.
 Five days later.
 Han Jue’s lifespan began to decrease.
 However, the curse stopped just as ten million years of his lifespan were deducted.
 He missed.
 Eh?
 curse?”
 (1 trillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 So expensive!
 Continue!
 [Ancient Soul Bead: Ultimate Dao Treasure, Avoid Karma, Avoid Providence, Soul Absorption, can freely travel through the past.]
 Ultimate Dao Treasure!
 This was the first time Han Jue saw someone with an Ultimate Dao Treasure.
 No wonder this fellow was so arrogant. The Divine Robe Daoist was suppressed until he couldn’t fight back.
 In that case, he could only wait for Dao God Qing Xiao to personally visit him.
 At that time, he could let Great Sage Void Soul block for a period of time. He would use the simulation trial to find a way to insta-kill him before fighting. Han Jue dispersed the uneasiness in his heart and continued cultivating.
 …
 In the quiet void, Dao God Qing Xiao brought dozens of followers here. No one said anything. It was very silent.
 Suddenly!
 Dao God Qing Xiao stopped, and so did his followers.
 Two figures appeared in front of him. One of them was Huang Zuntian. He was slightly behind, and in front of him was a black-robed man. His figure was like flames and his true appearance could not be seen.
 Dao God Qing Xiao asked, “What do you mean?”
 The black-robed man said softly, “You defeated the Divine Robe Daoist. Your strength is not bad. Join me.”
 Dao God Qing Xiao frowned. “Then, who are
 you?”
 Without another word, the black-robed man waved his sleeve and attacked. The moment he raised his hand, endless black wind swept out and drowned Dao God Qing Xiao and the others.
 Huang Zuntian silently retreated. The other party could easily severely injure a Great Dao Divine Spirit. He was definitely not an ordinary person.
 In the blink of an eye, another fifty thousand years passed. Han Jue opened his eyes and stretched.
 Had he changed his mind?
 Han Jue started to check his emails.
 Devil Ancestor Lu Yuan was still something.
 Han Jue originally thought that this fellow would fight wantonly like the Heavenly Court and Life, but that was not the case. Devil Ancestor Lu Yuan kept a low profile and conserved his strength.
 This fellow would stir up the entire Chaos one day!
 A dignified voice interrupted Han Jue’s thoughts.
 The Great Dao Divine Spirits’ leader? Who was that?
 These words were only targeted at those above the Sage Realm?
 Anyway, Han Jue wouldn’t make a move.
 However, he was worried for Ancestor Xitian, Li Daokong, Shi Dudao, and Huang Zuntian.
 Han Jue asked in his mind, “Can the Great Dao Divine Spirits’ leader give the order to eliminate Life?”
 [900 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 (No]
 Indeed.
 Han Jue shook his head.
 It was not a coincidence that the First Life Black Sovereign could survive from the beginning of the Chaos until today. He needed a stronger force if he wanted to eliminate his force.
 [Qiu Xilai wants to visit you in your dreams. Do you accept?]
 Han Jue raised his eyebrows.
 It had been a long time since this fellow visited him in his dreams. He probably had something important to say.
 Han Jue chose to accept it.
 In the dream, Qiu Xilai was the first to speak, “Master, someone is investigating the Dao Destruction Mystical Power.”
 Han Jue asked, “In the Heavenly Dao?”
 Now that the Heavenly Dao was flourishing, Han Jue and the Sages would vomit blood if someone used the Dao Destruction Mystical Power to cleanse it.
 “No, it’s the Chaos. I’m currently in the Chaos. Not long ago, I encountered a mysterious existence who asked if I knew the Dao Destruction Mystical Power.”
 “What did you say?”
 “I naturally denied it. Although he didn’t pester me, I’m still a little worried. I’m afraid that this is a danger to the Heavenly Dao. The Dao Destruction Mystical Power is only targeted at the Heavenly Dao lifeforms.”
 “I understand. I’ll be careful. Be careful not to be targeted.” “Understood.”
 The dream also ended after the conversation ended.
 Han Jue immediately deduced, but he couldn’t deduce it himself. This meant that the other party was stronger than him or had a Supreme Treasure with the power to block deductions.
 “I want to know who asked Qiu Xilai about the Dao Destruction Mystical Power?”
 (700 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 A figure appeared in Han Jue’s mind.
 First Life Black Sovereign!
 It was him!
 Han Jue frowned and asked in his mind, “Why is the First Life Black Sovereign asking about the Dao Destruction Mystical Power?”
 (700 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 There was no illusion. A line of words appeared in front of him.
 (He wants to develop a Mystical Power that can kill all living beings in the Chaos.]
 In other words, this matter did not involve other karma. It was all thought by the First Life Black Sovereign, so it did not derive the scene at that time.
 Could it be that this fellow was forced by the Great Dao Divine Spirit?
 No!
 Perhaps his thought infuriated the Great Dao Divine Spirits.
 However, he was sensed by them for some reason.
 Han Jue fell into deep thought.
 The First Life Black Sovereign was so crazy. Should he just kill him in one go?
 He didn’t want his disciples to die.
 In the past, Han Jue wanted to use the First Life Black Sovereign to restrain the Great Dao Divine Spirits and the Chaotic Fiendcelestials. Now, something had happened.
 “How long will it take for the First Life Black Sovereign to develop a Mystical Power that can destroy all living beings in the Chaos?”
 (700 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [About 300 million years.]
  It seemed that the First Life Black Sovereign was also attempting to change the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity.
 They might be able to kill the nurtured Primordial Fiendcelestial in advance if all the living beings of the Chaos were killed.
 Then, he would wait a little longer.
 Han Jue wanted to wait until both Life and the Great Dao Divine Spirits were injured before taking out the First Life Black Sovereign without anyone knowing.
 Life would be leaderless if he cursed the First Life Black Sovereign to death now. Li Daokong and the others would suffer.
 Could this fellow also find a Supreme Treasure to avoid the curse in the future?
 Han Jue frowned again.
 He couldn’t wait.
 He should strangle him to death as soon as possible!
 Han Jue took out the Book of Misfortune and started cursing.


 Han Jue’s lifespan began to decrease after cursing for five days. As he cursed, he opened the emails and attributes panel.
 Endless surging Dharmic powers entered the Book of Misfortune and transformed into an extremely evil curse. Unknowingly, it traveled through space and time and attacked the First Life Black Sovereign in an unfathomable manner.
 At this moment, the First Life Black Sovereign was hiding in a barren star.
 He had been looking for the Dao Destruction Mystical Power for the past hundred thousand years. In the end, he was suddenly cursed five days ago, scaring him so much that he hurriedly found this place to hide.
 I knew it!
 The Dark Forbidden Lord was not testing him. He wanted to severely injure him again!
 First Life Black Sovereign gritted his teeth in anger.
 Why did the damned Dark Forbidden Lord keep pestering him? Who was the Dark Forbidden Lord?
 First Life Black Sovereign could only try his best to block the curse.
  However, he panicked as the curse power strengthened.
 A terrifying thought appeared in his mind.
 What if the Dark Forbidden Lord wanted to take this opportunity to curse him to death?
 ......
 CU
 It was not impossible!
 After all, the leader of the Divine Spirits had just announced that he wanted to eliminate Life!
 Could it be that the Dark Forbidden Lord was related to the Great Dao Divine Spirits?
 First Life Black Sovereign’s heart trembled. All along, the Dark Forbidden Lord’s actions made people feel that he belonged to the evil camp and might have ill intentions towards the Chaos. Now that he thought about it, it was not necessarily the case. It was very likely that the Dark Forbidden Lord was a Great Dao Divine Spirit who used his identity to eliminate all heretics in the Chaos.
 I see!
 First Life Black Sovereign’s eyes flickered as he began to think of a solution.
 Han Jue cursed as he stared at his lifespan.
 1 quadrillion years!
 5 quadrillion years!
 10 quadrillion years!
 [Because of your curse, your enemy First Life Black Sovereign’s Dao heart was damaged.)
 Continue cursing!
 20 quadrillion years!
 30 quadrillion years!
 (Because of your curse, your enemy First Life Black Sovereign’s body and Dao Fruit were shattered.)
 He was not dead yet!
 Continue!
 Han Jue was already hooked and decided to eliminate this fellow in one go.
 At this moment…
 (Your enemy First Life Black Sovereign unraveled the Great Dao himself. His soul has dissipated, leaving only a trace of will.]
 Han Jue’s curse missed after that.
 A loud voice sounded.
 “Dark Forbidden Lord, I didn’t expect you to be a Great Dao Divine Spirit. Deities, your methods are too despicable!”
 Only cultivators above the Sage Realm could hear it.
 Han Jue’s expression turned strange.
 Was he crazy?
 Why did he think of the Great Dao Divine Spirits?
 Just because the Divine Spirit spoke before he attacked?
 At the same time, the mighty figures of the Chaos were in an uproar.
 Although they didn’t know who the voice belonged to, it involved the Dark Forbidden Lord and the Great Dao Divine Spirits. They couldn’t think deeply.
 There was no smoke without fire!
 In an empty and dark palace, the Evil Heavenly Emperor sat in front of the Great Dao Concealment Fiendcelestial.
 They were all interrupted by the First Life Black Sovereign’s voice and fell silent.
  The Evil Heavenly Emperor had always thought that the Dark Forbidden Lord was related to Han Jue, but this fellow had already killed two Great Dao Divine Spirits. Although the Divine Robe Daoist had revived, he didn’t dare to offend the Heavenly Dao anymore.
 Did I guess wrong?
 “If the Dark Forbidden Lord has nothing to do with Han Jue, why did he…”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor suddenly thought of a problem. His enemy seemed to have been resolved by the Dark Forbidden Lord, but he did not end up well. He was directly expelled from the Heavenly Dao. They would be in trouble if it was anyone else!
 He was enlightened. So, it was his wishful thinking. No wonder Han Jue refused to admit
 it.
 The Great Dao Concealment Fiendcelestial muttered, “The voice just now was a little familiar. Why did he say that? What happened?”
 He tried his best to deduce, but he failed in the end.
 The Dark Forbidden Lord was already famous in the Chaos, but his reputation was not good. His name alone was infamous.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor said, “The Dark Forbidden Lord has nothing to do with us. Why think so much?”
 The Great Dao Concealment Fiendcelestial said, “That makes sense. But it’s not easy for you to revive your father. Although I don’t know why he became an Inauspicious Evil, there has been no precedent of an Inauspicious Evil escaping its identity since ancient times.”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor frowned.
 “Let’s think about how to save him first. Ancestor Xitian captured him and we don’t know where he is,” the Great Dao Concealment Fiendcelestial said. His tone was casual, clearly not wanting to care.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor understood what he meant and said, “Since you can’t find him, let’s change the topic.”
 The Great Dao Concealment Fiendcelestial glared at him and cursed, “Brat, how much have I helped you?!”
 “You’re not at a disadvantage, either. Your cultivation should have improved greatly.”
 “Tell me.”
 “I have a Buddhist spirit under me. I want him to cultivate under you for a period of time and learn a Great Dao Mystical Power.”
 “Again?”
 “Those two brats were captured by the Devil Ancestor. I have no choice now that the Heavenly Court doesn’t have anyone to shoulder the burden.”
 The Great Dao Concealment Fiendcelestial was silent for a moment before saying, “One last time.”
 “Thank you, senior!”
 “Hmph!”
 Mist rose in a murky space.
 Ancestor Xitian, Shi Dudao, Li Daokong, and more than ten figures gathered here.
 Dark Forbidden Lord?
 Everyone was stunned.
 Shi Dudao was surprised. What was Master doing?
 Li Daokong frowned. “In that case, the Dark Forbidden Lord is really a Great Dao Divine Spirit. His curse methods are unfathomable. What should we do?”
 Ancestor Xitian did not answer.
 The other Lives also began to discuss.
 “Even Life Lord can’t stop it. How can we be a match for the Dark Forbidden Lord?”
 “Yes! We’re doomed against the Great Dao Divine Spirits’ attacks.”
 “But we can’t escape the Calamity Life Controller’s karma.”
 “Can Life still be united now?”
 “Perhaps a new Life Lord has appeared.”
  Shi Dudao secretly felt disdain. A bunch of fools. The Dark Forbidden Lord was the true mastermind behind the Life faction. The Life Lord must have faked his death and definitely did not really die!
 This was definitely a trap!
 The Dark Forbidden Lord probably wanted to find the chaos within Life or make the Great Dao Divine Spirits think that the Life faction had been disbanded!
 Ancestor Xitian said, “Let’s hide here and cultivate for now. Although the Life Lord is dead, we are still Life. It’s useless even if we surrender to the Divine Spirits. The Chaos doesn’t tolerate us. We can only wait for an opportunity.”
 Li Daokong asked, “What about the other Lives?”
 “A new Life Lord will appear. He once said that the new Life Lord is stronger and is a famous figure in the Chaos,” Ancestor Xitian said expressionlessly.
 The other Lives heaved a sigh of relief and began to discuss who the new Life Lord was.
 They even mentioned the Heavenly Dao Divine Might Heavenly Sage!


 Han Jue didn’t know the situation in the Chaos and quickly entered cultivation after cursing the First Life Black Sovereign.
 No matter what, cultivation was the most important!
 Year after year passed.
 Another fifty thousand years passed.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and frowned.
 He suddenly felt a bottleneck.
 “I want to know how to break through to the Great Dao Supreme Realm?”
 Han Jue used the derivation function.
  (Cultivation technique cannot be deduced.]
 Hmph.
 ......
 He opened the emails and prepared to relax by checking on his friends.
 [Your good friend Huang Zuntian has received guidance from a mysterious mighty figure. His cultivation has increased.]
 [Your good friend Jiang Jueshi’s mind wandered to the Great Void. His will spied on the end of the Dao and suffered a backlash. His soul was damaged.]
 (Your enemy, the Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial, was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure.)
 [Your good friend Foolish Sword Sage slashed at the Divine Spirits’ karma and saw through the illusion. His cultivation has increased greatly.)
 (Your good friend Jiang Yi has absorbed the endless sea of flames and stepped into the Freedom Realm.]
 (Your good friend Divine Robe Daoist has received guidance from a mysterious mighty figure. His cultivation has increased.]
 Recently, the Chaos had been very calm. There were many opportunities.
 Han Jue noticed the emails of the Foolish Sword Sage.
 Slashing the Divine Spirits’ karma, what he severed was the Chaotic Deities’ karma?
 What was seeing through the illusion?
 This was not the first time Han Jue saw these words.
 It was probably related to the Great Dao Supreme Realm.
 Han Jue continued reading.
 Han Tuo’s encounter made him understand that the Great Dao Divine Spirit was also a Great Dao Providence Divine Authority, just like the Calamity Life Controller.
 All the Great Dao Divine Spirits were controlled by the Divine Spirits’ leader or the Chaotic Consciousness.
 Of course, it was very likely that his previous vision was limited. His circle of friends could not involve the Chaos, so at first glance, it looked like the Chaos was barren and desolate.
 What was the Great Dao Supreme?
 It was above the Great Dao!
 The current Han Jue couldn’t even take in the Chaos. How could he stand above the Great Dao?
 Han Jue suddenly had an idea.
 Should he travel the Chaos to spy on the Great Dao Supreme’s Dao attainment method?
 No!
 No way!
 This was a trap!
 Han Jue felt that since he became a Primordial Fiendcelestial, he couldn’t develop according to the pace of the Chaos!
 That’s right!
 I should think about it from my own perspective!
 Perhaps the method to attain the Dao already existed. It was in his body and not in the outside world.
 Han Jue closed the emails and focused on the Stellar Primordial Body.
 All along, he had only spied on the Primordial World in the depths of his soul and ignored his body.
 The soul was the most important. This was the main theme of cultivation in the Chaos!
 But was it really suitable for the Primordial Chaos?
 Why was the Stellar Primordial Body a Primordial Fiendcelestial?
 Didn’t that mean that there might be more than one Primordial Fiendcelestial?
 Just like the three thousand Chaotic Fiendcelestials.
 Stars…
 What was a star?
 Under the dazzling golden sky, the endless sea of clouds connected to the land.
 Han Tuo and Yi Tian walked side by side. Three figures were following them. They walked in the same direction.
 In front of them was a huge white circle of light at the end of the sea of clouds, like a door.
 “The sea of clouds beneath my feet is actually the power of the Great Dao. Tsk tsk, what is this place?”
 Yi Tian sent a voice transmission to Han Tuo, his tone filled with surprise.
 Han Tuo replied, “Don’t look around. It’s probably the Dao Field of an ancient Great Dao Divine Spirit.”
 Yi Tian stopped transmitting his voice, but his Sage Sense was still spying on the surroundings.
 After a while.
 The five Great Dao Divine Spirits were shocked by the strange phenomenon on the white circle of light and were immersed.
 Han Tuo suddenly woke up. It had only been a few breaths of time, but his cultivation level had increased a little.
 Impossible!
 Han Tuo became nervous.
 A loud voice resounded in this world.
 Hearing this, the five Great Dao Divine Spirits immediately stepped into the Divine Gate.
 Han Tuo was still thinking about who the voice belonged to the moment he stepped in.
 “Oh? Demonic path? You’re courting death!”
 A loud voice sounded. Han Tuo was shocked and could no longer turn around.
Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n)) Boom
 His consciousness instantly shattered and fell into blankness.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and quickly recovered.
 He checked his attributes panel. More than ten thousand years had passed.
 Time passed really quickly. It felt even faster than cultivation.
 Han Jue had a bold thought during this period of time.
 He wanted to use the countless stars in the Primordial World.
 He mainly thought of the drop of water from the Holy Mother of Order. How terrifying was it to directly shatter the Heavenly Dao?
 Wouldn’t he be able to crush a world with a star if he reached the Great Dao Supreme Realm?
 He felt that the drop of water from the Holy Mother of Order was not a coincidence, because, in the previous deduction, the Holy Mother of Order stood above a sea. That sea world might be the same as his Primordial World.
 The Great Dao Supreme’s soul world!
 In the past, the stars of the Primordial World were only convenient to store Dharmic powers. They lost their effect after Han Jue’s Dharmic powers became endless. After all, it was still extremely far away from transforming into a living being.
 Han Jue began to pour his Dharmic powers into the stars in the Primordial World.
  Now, the number of stars was no longer inferior to his lifespan count. He discovered a pattern. It seemed that no matter how much his lifespan increased, it would correspondingly produce as many stars. However, the stars would not shatter when his lifespan was consumed.
 These stars were definitely not simple!
 Han Jue began to use his Dharmic powers to refine all the stars after he poured all his Dharmic powers into each star.
 Boom
 Han Jue’s entire body emitted divine light. The surrounding space twisted violently as if it would shatter at any moment.
 He sensed patiently.
 It was indeed feasible!
 The stars began to slowly change as his Dharmic powers were refined. This feeling was very weak, but it was indeed there!
 “Could this be the method to attain the Great Dao Supreme Realm?”
 Han Jue was pleasantly surprised. He had thought of countless ways, but only this path was difficult to see the end.


 Refining 10.8 decillion stars required a long time. Han Jue couldn’t do it easily even if he was a Great Dao Sage.
 It took time for every star to transform. All Han Jue could do was refine these 10.8 decillion stars at the same time.
 The Great Dao of Extreme Origin resonated with him. Han Jue fell into an indescribable state. It was like joy and addiction, but also like a dream. He sank into it and consumed a lot of his will.
 After a certain period of time.
 He discovered that his cultivation level had increased greatly!
 The strengthening of the stars could actually increase his stagnant cultivation!
 This was the right path!
 Han Jue was excited.
  He checked his attributes panel and discovered that more than forty thousand years had passed.
 The increase in his cultivation level exceeded the effect of his previous seclusion of fifty thousand years, even surpassing the cultivation speed before his breakthrough.
 Han Jue didn’t continue cultivating but checked his emails.
 ......
 He couldn’t cultivate blindly. He had to look at the people around him to prevent anything from happening.
 Soon, Han Jue frowned.
 Something had indeed happened!
 (Your son Han Tuo was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure and was deprived of the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority. His soul is suppressed at the bottom of the Chaos.]
 (Your good friend Yi Tian was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure and was deprived of the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority. His soul is suppressed at the bottom of the Chaos.]
 Something had happened to the two of them again.
 Unlike Dao Sovereign and the other two, this time, Yi Tian and Han Tuo were suppressed at the bottom of the Chaos.
 What was the bottom of the Chaos?
 Han Jue was puzzled.
 The Chaos was not a single space. Multiple layers of space-time might not be superimposed. It could also be parallel or even extremely far away.
 Han Jue pinched his fingers to deduce. Indeed, he couldn’t deduce where the bottom of the Chaos was.
 He thought for a moment and sent a dream to Han Tuo.
 The dream was above the city wall.
 Han Tuo slowly opened his eyes. He was stunned when he saw him.
 The father and son faced each other and fell silent.
 Han Tuo said, “Father, I’m fine. You don’t have to worry.”
 Han Jue snorted. “Why didn’t you summon
 me?”
 Han Jue was speechless.
 Han Jue felt that it made sense. Han Tuo had been suppressed for more than twenty thousand years. This already meant that it was not a hopeless situation.
 “Alright,” Han Jue said helplessly.
 He had saved Han Tuo more than once. This fellow did not develop dependence and instead avoided him.
 It was not only Han Tuo. His disciples were the same.
 Han Tuo said, “Father, don’t worry. I can definitely protect myself.”
 Han Jue snorted and shook his head. He removed the dream.
 In reality, Han Jue opened his eyes.
 “This kid, when will he consider my feelings? He’s always in danger and feels that he doesn’t need to rely on me. Won’t I be worried?” Han Jue muttered to himself. He suddenly understood what parents were.
 He looked at the Heavenly Dao.
 Things would be fine if the providence sects were far stronger than all living beings. All living beings could only continue to endure.
 However, the Heavenly Dao could lead to the Chaos now. More and more cultivators had freedom and obtained great cultivation. Their mentality was naturally arrogant. The ones who enforced the peaceful rules were the providence sects, so they naturally became the center of the calamity.
 Han Jue thought silently.
 The Heavenly Dao was strong enough. An endless stream of resources was transferred from the Chaos. Only by transferring the conflict to the Chaos could true peace be achieved, not the current peace that hid grudges.
 Han Jue looked around and didn’t find any more geniuses like Jiang Jueshi. He felt a little regretful.
 Gathering geniuses was also a form of entertainment.
 It would be wonderful when they grew up and dominated their own regions.
 Several days later, Han Jue continued to refine the stars.
 The Heavenly Dao surged. Cultivators floated in time, while mighty figures wandered outside.
 Gradually, the Sages of the older generation were not as famous as the new ones. Just like before the Heavenly Dao restarted, Qiu Xilai was more famous than Ancestor Xitian.
 The Hidden Sect’s development was also smooth. With the help of Han Jue’s clone, some disciples entered and some left.
 Li Xuan’ao and Han Zuitian became the greatest leaders of the sect. One faced the outside world, while the other faced the inside.
 Already hundreds of millions of disciples were under him, and this was even when some disciples left the Hidden Sect.
 Li Xuan’ao maintained Han Jue’s philosophy. The Hidden Sect had always kept a low profile, but they were related to all the sects and had the favor of a Sage. Cultivators with some experience knew that the Hidden Sect was the number one sect in the Heavenly Dao!
 However, the Hidden Sect did not cultivate providence. The disciples lacked the providence of the sect.
 After a certain period of time.
 Han Jue woke up again. The 10.8 decillion stars transformed again and his cultivation increased greatly. He checked his attributes panel and discovered that more than 87,000 years had passed.
 Time passed quickly.
 Han Jue started the simulation trial.
 He wanted to test his cultivation results!
 It was still five thousand Foolish Sword Sages!
 He fought with all his might and easily suppressed them.
 In the second simulation trial, he increased the number of Foolish Sword Sages to seven thousand.
 He could barely fight!
 He could win with enough time!
 Han Jue challenged ten thousand Foolish Sword Sages next.
 It was very difficult, but he could fight!
Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎 Han Jue opened his eyes and heaved a sigh of relief after dozens of simulation trials.
 “No, it’s not enough. The Divine Authority Generals are definitely stronger than the Foolish Sword Sage. I might not be able to defeat them even if I defeat ten thousand Foolish Sword Sages. I have to have the strength to insta-kill a hundred thousand Foolish Sword Sages before I can face them!”
 Han Jue’s eyes became firm.
 He tried and challenged twenty thousand Foolish Sword Sages alone!
 Then…
  Han Jue opened his eyes and shivered.
 Too terrifying
 Han Jue decided to attain the Great Dao Supreme Realm first!
 He continued to refine the stars.
 At this moment…
 [Foolish Sword Sage sent you a dream. Do you accept?]
 Han Jue wanted to vomit upon seeing the words “Foolish Sword Sage”.
 Perhaps he was the one who knew the Foolish Sword Sage the best in the world.
 Han Jue still chose to accept it after hesitating for a moment.
 He could go over and copy Foolish Sword Sage’s latest strength if he could build a good relationship with him.
