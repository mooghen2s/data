 He didn’t know about the changes in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End, but the Immortal World was still stable. After being attacked by the five Sages, the Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage became well-behaved and did not take the next step. Under the siege of the various factions, the demons were torn apart.
 The demons declined just like that.
 The demons hated the various factions and did not want to join the Famous Race. Therefore, they began to use the name of the Ancient Race a hundred thousand years ago. The Sages had no objections to this. They were enemies with the Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage, not the demons themselves.
 Time passed quickly. Year after year passed. A thousand years passed in the blink of an eye. Han Jue opened his eyes and stretched. The chaos did not affect the Heavenly Dao. Everyone didn’t even know what was happening outside.
 Han Jue checked his emails and couldn’t help but be moved.
 (Your good friend Evil Heavenly Emperor was attacked by a mysterious Dao Devil] x73629
 (Your son Han Tuo was attacked by a mysterious Dao Devil) x2930
 (Your good friend Ancestor Xitian was attacked by an Inauspicious Evil) x90293
 (Your disciple Zhou Fan was attacked by an Inauspicious Evil] x1594
 (Your good friend Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du was attacked by a mysterious Dao Devil) x928202
 So many attacks!
 Inauspicious Evil! Mysterious Dao Devil!
 Han Jue noticed that Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du was also attacked. He looked up and discovered that Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du wasn’t in the Dao Field outside the 33rd Heaven. He had probably gone to the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End earlier.
 The Deity Realm of the Ruins of End was in chaos!
 Han Jue was amused.
 He didn’t expect the curse to have such an effect. Although this matter would harm many innocent people, he couldn’t care less. I would rather see others die than die myself! With the hatred of the Chaotic Deity, he would find trouble with Han Jue sooner or later. In any case, the Chaotic Deity would die sooner or later.
 Once the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End was in chaos, they would no longer scheme against the Heavenly Dao in a short period of time. No wonder the Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage was so quiet.
 “Sigh, I’m still the greatest contributor to the Heavenly Dao.” Han Jue sighed. Oh Dao Ancestor, if you see this, you must remember my kindness and not scheme against me!
 After reading the emails, Han Jue looked at the Immortal World.
 Ever since Li Daokong attained the Dao, Han Yu had been considered to have graduated. Now, he had traveled the Immortal World alone and his reputation had soared.
 This kid was already an Immortal Emperor. Not bad. Han Yu hid in a forest and cultivated. He didn’t encounter any trouble for the time being.
 The current Immortal World had already surpassed the Immortal World from before the calamity. It was mainly because the Sages took turns preaching the Dao, causing the cultivation level of the cultivators to increase very quickly. Who would have thought that a hundred thousand years ago, the Immortal World was still barren?
 Han Jue came to the second Dao Field and started to pay attention to the Fiendcelestial candidates.
 Yang Du had already left the Earth Immortal World. Han Jue calculated that this fellow was not in danger. He even obtained many great opportunities and had great providence.
 As for the other Fiendcelestial candidates, only two were still alive.
 They were called Ren Gang and Yin Hongchen. Yin Hongchen was a woman.
 Her appearance was not devastatingly beautiful, and she did things extremely ruthlessly. She usually did not take the initiative to provoke others, but if she discovered that someone was a threat to her, she would definitely eliminate them as quickly as possible. Ren Gang was filled with righteousness and could easily make friends.
 Just like facing Yang Du, Han Jue didn’t expose his identity. After making arrangements for the two of them, Han Jue walked out of the Daoist temple to visit Murong Qi, the crimson fox, and the Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial. Their cultivation levels increased very quickly. The Spirit Qi in the Dao Field was even richer than in the Immortal World.
 Han Jue explained the Dao to them alone. The Great Dao of Extreme Origin contained the profundities of all the Great Dao and could allow them to gain some insights. Ten years later, Han Jue returned to the Hundred Peak Immortal River and continued cultivating.
 Dark Forbidden Zone. The Evil Heavenly Emperor sat on a huge meteor and cultivated. Black Qi surrounded him, and his aura was terrifying. At this moment, a black shadow appeared in front of him and knelt down.
 “Your Majesty, the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End is already in chaos. The Seven Dao Sage was attacked by a powerful Dao Devil and was severely injured. More and more living beings began to escape towards the Heavenly Dao,” the black shadow said in a low voice with excitement. The Evil Heavenly Emperor slowly opened his eyes. He frowned and muttered to himself, “Looks like the Chaotic Deity has really perished. Who is the Dark Forbidden Lord? He’s actually so powerful.”
 He had once suspected that Han Jue was the Dark Forbidden Lord, or that Han Jue’s master was the Dark Forbidden Lord. Now, he didn’t think so anymore. Because the Chaotic Deity was too powerful!
 The Chaotic Deity who controlled the Chaotic Order was a true Great Dao Divine Spirit. Even if the Heavenly Dao Sages came to the Chaos, they had to follow the rules. With the death of such an extraordinary existence, the Evil Heavenly Emperor first thought of the long-lost Dao Ancestor.
 Only the Dao Ancestor could kill him! “Your Majesty, should we take action? This is the best opportunity for the Heavenly Court to recruit troops!” The black shadow asked.
 The black shadow replied, “After the Chaotic Deity died, the Inauspicious Evil that restricted the Little Heavenly Dao all surged towards the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End.
 The providence of the Little Heavenly Dao is rapidly increasing.” “Where’s the Ancient Desolate?”
 “It’s said that more than ten Transcendent Dao Expert are guarding it. The Inauspicious Evil and the Dao Devils are all rushing to the Ancient Desolate like mad. Your Majesty, what is hidden in the Ancient Desolate?”
 The black shadow was very curious. The situation was too abnormal.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor did not answer, but his eyes revealed worry. “By the way, recently, two Heavenly Dao lifeforms have trespassed into the Heavenly Court’s territory.
 I’ve already made a move to capture them. The providence of these two is not simple. They are very similar to the Chaotic Fiendcelestials. I don’t dare to kill them easily. Your Majesty, please make a decision.” The black shadow saw that the Evil Heavenly Emperor did not want to reveal anything and changed the topic. “Oh? Chaotic Fiendcelestials? Bring them here.”
 “Yes!”
 The black shadow vanished. Five minutes later, the black shadow appeared in front of the Evil Heavenly Emperor. He waved his right hand, and two figures fell to the ground. They were Han Tuo and Yi Tian.
 The two of them were wrapped in a black aura and could not break free. Yi Tian cursed. “What are you doing? If you want to kill or torture me, say something!” Han Tuo looked around warily, his gaze landing on the Evil Heavenly Emperor. The Evil Heavenly Emperor’s appearance was clearly not righteous, making him even more nervous.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor frowned when he saw Han Tuo.
 He waved his hand and said, “Black Heaven General, leave first.” “Yes!”
 The black shadow vanished again.
 Yi Tian also looked nervously at the Evil Heavenly Emperor. He could sense that he was different from the enemies he had encountered in the past.
 Profound and mysterious! Han Tuo gritted his teeth and said, “Senior, we just accidentally entered your territory. We have no ill intentions. Why are you holding onto us and not letting go?”
 He had no choice but to bow his head. The Evil Heavenly Emperor asked, “What’s your name?”
 Han Tuo replied, “My name is Tang Sanzang.” Yi Tian glared at him.
 Taking advantage of me?
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor smiled, and the terrifying aura around him retracted.
 He’s really similar to that kid. Be it his looks or his mouth. The Evil Heavenly Emperor’s lips curled up slightly.
 He slowly stood up and said, “Since you’re here, don’t even think about leaving. From today onwards, the two of you will serve me!”


 “Why should I serve you? Are you very strong?” Yi Tian shouted unhappily. He had always been the one taking in subordinates. He had never been anyone’s subordinate. Previously, in the demons and the Divine Palace, the leaders had been polite to him.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor said calmly, “I’m the previous Heavenly Emperor of the Heavenly Court. I’ve already attained the Dao. Tell me, am I strong?”
 The previous Heavenly Emperor?
 Han Tuo was shocked. The current Heavenly Emperor was Fang Liang, and Fang Liang was his father’s grand-disciple. Was the Evil Heavenly Emperor a friend or foe of his father, Han Jue?
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor seemed to see through his nervousness. “Back then, before your father became an immortal, he was highly regarded by me. Your father even worked for me. Don’t you want that?”
 Han Tuo asked carefully, “My father?”
 Yi Tian was surprised. Wasn’t Han Tuo’s father long gone?
 “That’s right. It’s Han Jue, the master of the Hidden Sect,” the Evil Heavenly Emperor said calmly.
 Han Tuo looked like Han Jue. The Evil Heavenly Emperor had just calculated the karma and actually couldn’t deduce it. This meant that Han Tuo had a powerful background and could only be related to Han Jue.
 Yi Tian widened his eyes and exclaimed, “Your father is the Sect Master of the Hidden Sect? Why didn’t you mention it before?”
 The master of the Hidden Sect was a legendary figure in the Immortal World. He was on par with Sages and had once saved the myriad worlds in the universe. He had endless merit.
 Han Tuo smiled bitterly. “I only learned of it not long ago.”
 He looked at the Evil Heavenly Emperor.
 He was still a little vigilant, but the other party directly told him about his relationship with Han Jue. He naturally couldn’t lie.
 “Can you tell me about the past you knew my father?” Han Tuo asked.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor smiled meaningfully and slowly sat down. “Of course. This has to start before the Heavenly Dao was restarted. At that time, the Heavenly Court controlled the myriad worlds in the universe. Your father was only a nobody in a mortal world...’
 Han Tuo meditated and began to listen carefully.
 Yi Tian was also very interested in Han Tuo’s father and began to listen quietly.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor fell into a daze and recounted the past.
 After a long while...
 After the Evil Heavenly Emperor finished speaking, Han Tuo and Yi Tian were still immersed in the past.
 Yi Tian jolted awake and suddenly asked, “According to you, the Sect Master of the Hidden Sect only used a few hundred thousand years to attain the Dao?”
 Han Tuo also realized this, and his expression turned strange.
 Han Tuo’s expression changed drastically.
 30,000 years... If he was given thirty thousand years, he might not be able to break through to the perfected Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm. Han Jue, who was only thirty thousand years older than him, was already a top-notch existence among Sages. This difference...
 “Oh, right, I’ve calculated. Han Jue’s Dao attainment timing was close to your birth date. In other words, it only took Han Jue more than thirty thousand years to go from a mortal to a Sage,” the Evil Heavenly Emperor teased.
 He was also shocked.
 This kid...
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor knew that Han Jue’s talent was extremely terrifying, but after thinking about it, it made his scalp tingle.
 Han Tuo and Yi Tian fell into shock and couldn’t extricate themselves for a long time.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor did not disturb them. He had to calm down himself.
 Han Tuo looked up and clenched his fists. “You’ve nurtured my father. Then, I’ll serve you. Can you let me catch up to my father?”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor’s expression did not change as he felt a little awkward.
 He was ashamed to say this. He knew his limits. It was impossible for his care for Han Jue to help him attain the Dao. He himself had relied on the inheritance of the Dark Sage King to attain the Dao.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor said, “I can’t promise you directly. Your father’s talent is unheard of. However, if you serve me, you will definitely obtain a huge opportunity. The opportunity far exceeds your growth in the Immortal World. The Immortal World is still the chessboard of the Sages, but there are existences stronger than them in the Dark Forbidden Zone. Now that the Chaos is in chaos, it’s time to fight for the huge opportunity.
 “The two of you have the potential of Chaotic Fiendcelestials. I will confer you the title of Heavenly Generals. There will only be three Heavenly Generals in the Heavenly Court. Your status will only be second to mine!”
 Han Tuo and Yi Tian looked at each other and saw the anticipation in each other’s eyes.
 Instead of messing around, it was better to follow the Ancient Heavenly Emperor who had nurtured a Sage!
 Yi Tian asked, “What’s a Chaotic Fiendcelestial?”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor looked at him deeply. “You are!”
 Yi Tian was stunned.
 Han Tuo was very calm. Yi Tian’s potential was too ridiculous. Even if his father gave him a cheat, he almost couldn’t catch up.
 Only the legendary Chaotic Fiendcelestial could explain it!
 Wait.
 Then, what was his father?
 Was he also a Chaotic Fiendcelestial?
 The difference in potential between the Chaotic Fiendcelestials was also great?
 Han Tuo couldn’t figure it out, but after hearing the Evil Heavenly Emperor’s story, he suddenly didn’t dare to expect to surpass Han Jue. He only hoped to satisfy him.
 A thousand years passed.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and deduced Han Tuo.
 This fellow had left the Heavenly Dao for a period of time. His cultivation level had been increasing, but the Dark Forbidden Zone was still very dangerous.
 After calculating with his fingers, Han Jue’s expression became strange.
 Eh?
 He deduced that there was a familiar providence beside Han Tuo.
 Evil Heavenly Emperor...
 Providence was very mysterious. Not only was there providence in the Heavenly Dao, but there was also providence in the Chaos. It was the providence of the Great Dao.
 “This kid...”
 Han Jue suddenly discovered that Han Tuo’s path was very similar to his. Along the way, he encountered the care of Immortal Emperor Samsara and the Heavenly Emperor.
 However, the Evil Heavenly Emperor was ultimately on the wrong path. Han Jue was still a little worried.
 “I want to know what will happen if Han Tuo follows the Evil Heavenly Emperor?” Han Jue asked in his mind.
 Continue!
 Han Jue’s consciousness entered the illusion.
 He opened his eyes and discovered that he had arrived at a huge meteor. Countless figures were standing around him. Not only on the meteor, but countless figures were also floating in the surrounding space. They were all dressed in black armor and surrounded by a black aura. They were all looking in one direction.
 Evil Heavenly Emperor...
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor sat on a stone chair with a domineering attitude. In front of him stood three figures emitting a terrifying aura. Among them were Han Tuo and Yi Tian.
 Eh?
 Han Jue narrowed his eyes. He noticed that Han Tuo’s state was like that of a Freedom Sage. His Freedom aura was visible to the naked eye.
 Yi Tian said in a low voice, “Your Majesty, we are ready.”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor slowly stood up. The entire dark space distorted as a domineering aura erupted, sweeping through the Dark Forbidden Zone.
 “Immortal Gods of the Heavenly Court, I have established the Heavenly Court for several eras. The Heavenly Court has unified the Dark Forbidden Zone and swept through the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End. We have destroyed the Inauspicious Evil, expelled the Dao Devils, and protected hundreds of Little Heavenly Dao. You are my proudest soldiers. Now, an unprecedented enemy is about to arrive. We can’t retreat. If we do, the Heavenly Dao will definitely be destroyed!
 “Are you prepared to fight for the honor of Heavenly Court?”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor’s voice was filled with dominance, causing all the immortals of the Heavenly Court to reply in unison, “I am willing to sacrifice my body and soul for Your Majesty!”


 Several eras… Han Jue thought that the Evil Heavenly Emperor would be plotted against in a few years. He didn’t expect him to still be able to sweep through the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End.
 Han Jue saw a light appear in the darkness behind the Evil Heavenly Emperor. It quickly expanded and illuminated the Dark Forbidden Zone.
 Han Tuo suddenly jumped up and took out a golden spear with black patterns. He roared hoarsely, “He’s here! Prepare for battle!” A terrifying figure emerged from Han Tuo’s body. It was the Dharma idol of a Chaotic Fiendcelestial. Yi Tian roared at the sky. His body quickly grew taller and transformed into a terrifying figure that was ten million feet tall. His upper body was like a human and his lower body was like a flood dragon. His muscles were like they were cast from iron. He had three heads and six arms and had a sinister expression. As his white hair fluttered, four vertical eyes appeared on his face. Han Jue saw that light rushing over at an extremely terrifying speed. The surrounding immortals of the Heavenly Court instantly turned into dust.
 The illusion shattered! In a daze, Han Jue saw that half of the Evil Heavenly Emperor’s body had also turned into dust.
 When he opened his eyes again, Han Jue’s consciousness had already returned to reality.
 He frowned. Who was the Heavenly Court facing? Although it happened several eras later, when facing such an unknown opponent, he had to know in advance and prepare in advance.
 Han Jue liked to kill the terrifying big boss in his cradle.
 How dangerous would it be when the enemy came knocking on his door!
 “I want to know who the enemy that the Heavenly Court encountered in the illusion was?” Han Jue asked in his mind.
 [It involves karma that surpasses the current limits of the system. It cannot be deduced.] So powerful? Han Jue frowned.
 Could it be that the Dao Ancestor had turned evil? No, it might be the mysterious existence that forced the Dao Ancestor to disappear! Unable to figure it out, Han Jue could only give up. It was still a long time away. In other words, it was a good thing that Han Tuo followed the Evil Heavenly Emperor. As for the terrifying existence he encountered in the end, it was not targeted at the Heavenly Court, but the entire Chaos.
 In that case, it was good to let Han Tuo follow the Evil Heavenly Emperor.
 It could be considered making up for the fact that Han Jue didn’t serve the Evil Heavenly Emperor back then.
 “I have to reevaluate the Evil Heavenly Emperor. He should only hate the Heavenly Dao Sages and still care about the Heavenly Dao.”
 Han Jue thought.
 He looked at Great Loose Heaven.
 Han Jue thought. Among his disciples, Dao Sovereign was still far from attaining the Dao. There was no need to mention the others. It took a long time for a Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal to reach the Pseudo-Sage Realm. It was even more so for an early-stage and perfected Pseudo-Sage. How did the Sages outside the Heavenly Dao break through?
 Han Jue felt that the Primordial Purple Qi was not necessary. There had to be another way.
 He would see in the future.
 Han Jue continued to pay attention to the other outer sect disciples of the Hidden Sect.
 It was very difficult to cultivate in the Freedom Realm. Han Jue couldn’t relax. His goal was to catch up to the Great Dao Sages and surpass them.
 Spring passed and autumn came. The situation in the Immortal World changed.
 Another two thousand years passed. There were no longer any demons in the Immortal World. The Ancient Race and the Famous Race were on opposite sides. The number of living beings was immeasurable. Han Jue ended his seclusion again and opened his eyes.
 He habitually checked his emails. The recent emails were no different from the past. No information attracted him for the time being. It was worth mentioning that the outside of the Heavenly Dao was still ravaged by the Inauspicious Evil and Dao Devils. Han Jue closed the emails, and his Sage Sense swept through the Immortal World. He suddenly discovered that rolling Chaotic Qi was gathered on the east side of the Immortal World. It was like a long bridge that disappeared into the darkness.
 Han Jue pinched his fingers to deduce and discovered that he couldn’t see anything.
 He placed his gaze outside the 33rd Heaven. At this moment, the Sages were gathered in the Universal Hall as if they were discussing something. Even the Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage was there.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du gestured for Han Jue to sit beside him. Han Jue didn’t stand on ceremony and sat on his left.
 The Sages were moved.
 The other Sages also found it strange. Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “I think we can give it a try. All of you, review the history. Don’t you realize that the world created by Giant God Pangu has been shrinking? Every time the Sages fight, the Dao Ancestor will take the opportunity to split the Heavenly Dao Heaven and Earth. Where did those worlds that were split go?”


 The Sages all looked at the Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage.
 The Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage snorted. “Aren’t you from the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End?”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “Indeed, but you and I were born in the Heavenly Dao. We can’t forget our roots. I’ll first declare that I’m severing ties with the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End’s Human School. From now on, the Human School will be divided into the Heavenly Dao Human School and the Ruins of End Human School.”
 The Sages were moved. How ruthless!
 Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage was also shocked as his eyelids twitched.
 This was a declaration of war!
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du looked at the South Extreme Heavenly Venerate and Sect Master Tian Jue.
 “From today onwards, the Jie School will be divided into the Heavenly Dao Jie School and the Ruins of End Jie School. The Heavenly Dao Jie School will only serve the Heavenly Dao!”
 “From today onwards, the Chan School will be divided into the Heavenly Dao Chan School and the Ruins of End Chan School. The Heavenly Dao Chan School will only serve the Heavenly Dao!”
 The two Sages expressed their stand. Qiu Xilai, Emperor Xiao, and Heavenly Venerate Wufa were the same.
 Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage was silent.
 Han Jue’s body was covered by divine light. No one saw his mocking expression.
 He wanted to see what the Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage would do in this situation.
 Should he continue enduring the humiliation or overturn the chessboard?
 Fang Liang, Li Daokong, and Shi Dudao also looked at Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage. The atmosphere became strange. “Hehe.”
 Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage suddenly sneered. As he closed his eyes, a terrifying aura erupted, wreaking havoc in the Divine Palace.
 “You want to force me with your identity as a Heavenly Dao Sage?”
 Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage’s tone was sinister, and his words were filled with killing intent.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said calmly, “Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage, are you fighting as a pawn or for yourself? You can choose. If you want to jump out of your brother’s control, this will be the best opportunity.” Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage suddenly stood up, startling the other Sages. He raised his right hand, and flames burned in his palm. A black bell emitting an ancient aura slowly rose from the flames.
 The Sages took out their Dharma treasures and prepared to fight. The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate mocked. “Eastern Emperor, you want to kill a Heavenly Dao Sage in the Heavenly Dao? How ridiculous!” Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage glanced at the Sages disdainfully and said, “Do you know why the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End sent me here? It’s because your rebellious nature has long been exposed. When I fused with the Heavenly Dao, you had already failed.”
 Boom
 A terrifying suction force erupted from the black bell in the Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage’s hand. The Universal Hall shook violently. The Sages were shocked. They felt something being extracted from their bodies. “What power is this?”
 Qiu Xilai said in anger, “He’s absorbing our Heavenly Dao providence!” Once the providence of the Heavenly Dao was sucked dry, only one path waited for them.
 Death!
 Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage laughed wildly. “Do you understand how stupid you are? A pawn wants to jump out of the chessboard? Are you qualified?”
 Boom
 The black bell shook violently. The terrifying suction force was still increasing, preventing the Sages from moving even if they tried their best. The difference in cultivation was too great!
 Han Jue stood up, and a domineering aura dispersed the black bell’s suction force. The Sages regained control of their bodies and flashed behind Han Jue. Shi Dudao looked at Han Jue’s back in shock. “So strong!” The moment he stood up, he dispersed the suction force that made him despair!
 The Dao Seekers cultivating outside the 33rd Heaven fled. Only the cultivators of Chaotic City could continue guarding.
 Zhou Fan stood on the city wall and looked at the Universal Hall with a frown.
 The disciples of the various sects began to discuss what had happened.
 In the Universal Hall.
 Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage narrowed his eyes and said, “Sect Master of the Hidden Sect, Han Jue, do you really want to stop me? Didn’t you say that you won’t be affected by karma and won’t cause trouble?” Han Jue said indifferently, “If you want to harm the Heavenly Dao, I have no choice but to make a move.”
 “You’ve only just entered the Freedom Realm. Do you really think you’re my match?”
 you.”
 The Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage frowned.
 He was very afraid of Han Jue. The Deity Realm of the Ruins of End’s plan had been destroyed by him time and time again. No one knew Han Jue’s true depth.
 Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage wanted to continue speaking when Han Jue suddenly attacked. The Primordial Judgment Sword appeared in his hand, and he slashed out with it.
 Mystical Power, Unparalleled Sword Qi!
 The domineering sword Qi instantly shattered the Universal Hall. The Sages behind Han Jue were also killed. Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage’s expression changed drastically. He raised the bell to block, but he was still sent flying.
 Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage’s robes fluttered as he stabilized himself with a terrified expression. “This fellow’s sword Qi… has he really just entered the Freedom Realm?”
 He stared fixedly at the vast sand formed by the Universal Hall. He saw terrifying Dharma Idols slowly stand up and disperse the dust. The nine Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols above Han Jue’s head approached Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage. The Sages who were affected earlier condensed their bodies and retreated far away. They didn’t expect Han Jue to accidentally injure them in order to deal with Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage. Li Daokong was also shocked. Sect Master was really ruthless!
 Han Jue raised the Primordial Judgment Sword. The nine Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols fused together and transformed into a terrifying force that entered the blade. Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage took out the black bell. The bell rang, and all living beings in the world were stunned. The Chaotic Space distorted. Han Jue suddenly felt a mysterious force crossing the River of Time to target him. This feeling was very strange, but it did exist! Mighty figures could guard against enemies by attacking their past selves! [Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage has developed hatred towards you. Current Hatred Points: 6 stars]
 [Detected that the Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage has crossed the River of Time and wants to harm the past you. Do you want to use the system to resist?]
 Yes!
 Han Jue saw the notification in front of him and chose yes.
 With the system around, he could focus on the battle ahead.
 Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage was something. He could actually harm his past self in front of him. The power of time was very difficult to show in the simulation trial. Han Jue still underestimated Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage’s strength. Han Jue waved his sword and slashed. The Great Dao Mystical Power, Primordial Divine Rage, swept out with the power of the nine Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols. The sword Qi swept past Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage at an extremely fast speed. A terrifying black crack that was unknown in the Chaotic Space tore open. Too fast!
 The Sages couldn’t see this sword Qi at all. Even someone as strong as Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage couldn’t react in time and was reduced to dust.
 Almost instantly, Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage condensed his body again.
 The Heavenly Dao Sage was undying and indestructible!
 Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage’s expression was extremely ugly. He raised the black bell and aimed its mouth at Han Jue. Countless Golden Crows flew out from the black bell and surged towards Han Jue.
 The Sage Dao Fields along the way turned into dust one after another!
 The Sages watched from afar and did not dare to approach. In front of a Freedom Sage, Heavenly Dao Sages were like ants.


 Han Jue condensed the Devour Fiendcelestial Dharma idol. His figure was like a giant demon. He opened his huge black hole-like mouth and swallowed countless Golden Crows. Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage cursed silently. “Why can’t I capture the past him?”
 Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage frowned in confusion.
 He had relied on this Mystical Power to dominate the same realm. This was the first time he had encountered such a situation.
 Han Jue didn’t care what he thought. He condensed the Imprisonment Fiendcelestial and the Traversal Fiendcelestial, fusing the two powers into his body.
 Almost instantly, Han Jue moved behind Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage. The other party vanished into thin air, and Han Jue traveled again.
 The two Sages chased each other, their figures leaving behind dazzling afterimages outside the 33rd Heaven
 The Sages were dazzled. Shi Dudao clenched his fists in his sleeves and gritted his teeth. “What speed is this… No, it’s no longer speed, it’s Dao!” That’s right, Han Jue and Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage’s movement was no longer speed, but Dao’s judgment. In the blink of an eye, hundreds of millions of shadows appeared and occupied the void.
 Several breaths later.
 Han Jue struck Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage’s back with his palm. The Great Dao of Imprisonment erupted and instantly imprisoned
 him.
 “How can this be!”
 Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage was shocked. What Great Dao was this?
 It actually made his Freedom Power unable to be activated!
 Han Jue had already used more than one Great Dao power. What kind of existence was this kid?
 Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage had no choice but to control the black bell to protect him. Han Jue condensed dozens of Chaotic Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols and surrounded the black bell.
 Boom
 The black bell shattered and turned into countless stars that scattered as if a sea of stars had suddenly been born.
 Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage’s eyes widened in disbelief.
 A hundred times!
 A thousand times!
 Ten thousand times!
 A hundred thousand times!
 A million times!
 Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage was in despair. He had self-destructed a million times but still couldn’t escape his fate of being imprisoned. Han Jue was too serious!
 Even Shi Dudao was terrified. He wasn’t afraid that the enemy was powerful and invincible, but that he was also so difficult to deal with. Being targeted by Han Jue was definitely a nightmare. Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage was still reviving and Han Jue was still chasing after him. After ten million revivals, Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage couldn’t take it anymore. “Han Jue, you’re too ruthless!” Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage roared hoarsely. He self-destructed again. This time, he did not revive. Instead, he turned into countless flames that swept in all directions and quickly escaped the Heavenly Dao.
 This Mystical Power was extremely strange. Han Jue couldn’t sense its aura at all.
 However, he could clearly sense that Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage had already left the Heavenly Dao. He escaped? Han Jue frowned. He couldn’t find Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage even if he used the simulation trial.
 (Dijun’s hatred towards you has increased. Current Hatred Points: 6 stars]
 Complete enemy!
 Han Jue sighed.
 In the past, he had a good impression of Dijun. Unfortunately, this fellow’s future was bleak. Will you live well if you offend me? Although Han Jue was cowardly, he knew his limits. As long as he didn’t leave the Heavenly Dao, Dijun wouldn’t be able to kill him and would instead be tortured to death. Han Jue didn’t curse Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage immediately. He could do it after some time. At that time, he would curse Dijun to death and let Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage wallow in fear and despair. Han Jue closed his eyes and started cultivating. At the same time. The Immortal World and the myriad worlds in the universe were still in various calamities. Even the aftermath of the battle of the Sages was enough to form a calamity. The Sages had no choice but to clean up the aftermath. Even so, countless living beings had died.
 The Sages wouldn’t blame Han Jue for this. Instead, they admired him very much. If he didn’t chase Eastern Emperor Heaven Sage away, all living beings would suffer even more casualties in the future.
 Immortal World, above the clouds. Han Yu kept casting spells. The rain fell and extinguished the Heavenly Fire in the human city below.
 These heavenly flames were extremely sinister. Unless one was at the Emperor Realm, it was very difficult to extinguish them.
 The current Human Race was weak. There were only a few Immortal Emperors, and they couldn’t go around saving people. Han Yu looked up and frowned. He thought to himself, “Who is it? They actually harmed our Human Race like this.”
 His eyes burned with anger. Although he came from the mortal world, he had always believed in his human identity. During his travels in the Immortal World, if the humans were in trouble, he would definitely help them if he could. This was also thanks to Li Daokong. When Li Daokong preached, he often instructed him that if he became stronger in the future, he had to take care of the humans.
 Li Daokong felt that the Human Race shouldn’t be in such a sorry state. In the previous calamity, if not for the interference of the Sages, the Human Race wouldn’t have lost its identity as a Heavenly Dao Race. An hour later, Han Yu left to save the humans in the other cities.
 This was only a minority. Not only the humans, but the cultivators of the various races were also thinking of ways to save their races. The calamity caused by this battle caused the Immortal World to fall into a short period of peace. In less than a year, with the help of the Sages, the natural disasters in the myriad worlds were all eliminated.

Hao Tian said that he has a way to let me break through!”
