 Outside the 33rd Heaven, in the Universal Hall.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du, who was preaching, suddenly stopped. Tens of thousands of listeners opened their eyes.
 “Eh? What aura is this?”
 “Someone obtained the Zenith Heaven Dao Fruit?”
 “No, it’s not only Zenith Heaven!”
 “Why can’t I deduce this person’s providence?”
 The Dao Seekers discussed. Their cultivation levels were not low. They could see Jiang Jueshi who was breaking through at a glance, but they could not deduce his past.
 A Dao Seeker looked at Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du and asked, “May I ask who this person is?”
  Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “Speaking of which, this person has a relationship with our Human School. His name is Jiang Jueshi. He once joined the Human School with his younger brother, Jiang Dugu. For some reason, this person left the Human School and died in the world.”
 He was puzzled. He did not recognize Jiang Jueshi before, but now, he realized that he was not simple.
 Although he was only two thousand years old in this life, it was a long time ago.
 Most importantly, he actually could not understand why Jiang Jueshi could reach the Zenith Heaven Realm in a day and still want to continue breaking through.
 Wasn’t this the top prodigy that Fellow Daoist Han wanted?
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du had the intention to recruit him.
 Not only the Universal Hall, but the other Sage Dao Fields were also discussing Jiang Jueshi.
 Jiang Jueshi could be said to have endured for a trillion years and shocked the world!
 All the Sages were like Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du. They didn’t know Jiang Jueshi, but they all wanted to subdue him now!
 What a prodigy!
 There had never been such a huge breakthrough since ancient times!
 No one disturbed Jiang Jueshi.
 Ten days later.
 Jiang Jueshi broke through to the Pseudo-Sage Realm in one go, but he did not stop!
 The entire Immortal World was affected by him. The Spirit Qi far away even began to thin. It was obvious how exaggerated Jiang Jueshi’s breakthrough was.
 Han Jue was also paying attention to him.
 Could it be that this child had grasped the Great Dao?
 No!
 There was no Great Dao power!
 was n
 It was a cultivation technique!
 What cultivation technique was so powerful?
 “I want to know what cultivation technique Jiang Jueshi cultivates?”
 (500 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Moved, Han Jue chose to continue.
 Ultimate cultivation technique!
 Han Jue was secretly shocked. So impressive?
 (3 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [The fate of creation is indescribable. The Chaotic Consciousness, Pangu, the Dao Ancestor, Jiang Jueshi, and the others all have the potential of the Great Creation.)
 Unable to understand, Han Jue could only attribute it to his potential.
 This kid was impressive.
 Several months later.
 Jiang Jueshi used his strength to attain the Dao and directly attained the Primordial Chaos Dao Fruit, shocking the world. A huge amount of Heavenly Dao providence surged into his body and the endless sea stirred up a storm.
 At this moment, a line of words suddenly appeared in front of him.
 (Detected bearer of Connate providence, check its origin.)
 Han Jue raised his eyebrows.
 He immediately chose to check.
 Han Jue was moved.
 This fellow actually kept growing into a peerless prodigy that shocked the system under his watch!
 Amazing!
 This series of providence was clearly not simple. It was not there before!
 After attaining the Primordial Chaos Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm, Jiang Jueshi’s breakthrough finally ended. The Spirit Qi no longer gathered towards him.
 Jiang Jueshi was not expelled from the Immortal World by the Heavenly Dao!
 Impossible!
 He was not a Heavenly Dao Sage. Even if he was, he should be expelled to the 33rd Heaven and stay away from all living beings!
 At the peak of the mountain, Jiang Jueshi slowly opened his eyes.
 A purple wheel floated above his head. It was larger than the entire island and spun on its own. It was dazzling.
 Jiang Jueshi looked at his hands and smiled.
 He had finally succeeded after countless years of cultivation!
 There were not many existences older than him in the current Heavenly Dao. Some Sages could even be considered his juniors.
 “Heaven does not let down those who work hard. From now on, I will have no limits,” Jiang Jueshi muttered to himself as he stood up.
 With a thought, he swept through the myriad worlds!
 All living beings entered his eyes!
 For some reason, Jiang Jueshi thought of the old Daoist who had sacrificed himself to enlighten him.
 There was no surprise in his heart, only endless regret.
 He couldn’t find the old Daoist’s soul. Even if providence was connected to the Heavenly Dao.
 It seemed that he had really sacrificed himself. His body and soul had been destroyed.
 Jiang Jueshi’s eyes became firm.
 “Since Sages can’t, I’ll surpass them!”
 Jiang Jueshi looked up at the sky and transformed into a purple rainbow that soared into the sky. He pierced through the 33rd Heaven and arrived at the peak of the Heavenly Dao.
 He looked down and closed his eyes, quietly sensing his cultivation.
 At this moment, figures appeared nearby. They were the Heavenly Dao Sages.
 Li Taigu smiled and said, “Fellow Daoist is really powerful. You attained the Dao in one day. It’s unprecedented!”
 Yang Che smiled strangely. “This potential probably surpasses the Divine Might Heavenly Sage.”
 With that said, he felt many dissatisfied gazes and hurriedly shut up.
 Damn it!
 Are you all the dogs of the Divine Might Heavenly Sage? I’m just casually praising someone and you’re already anxious?
 Yang Che was indignant. He was clearly working hard, but he could not integrate into the circle of Sages.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du also appeared. He stared at Jiang Jueshi and smiled. “I didn’t expect the Human School to produce such a prodigy. It’s the fortune of the Human School.”
 With that, he turned around and left without any hesitation.
 The Sages were stunned. He left just like that?
 “Aren’t you going to repay the Heavenly Dao’s kindness?” Heavenly Venerate Wufa snorted.
 Jiang Jueshi stopped and said, “I will definitely return if the Heavenly Dao is in trouble in the future.”
 Ji Xianshen said, “Tian Zhan, test his cultivation.”
  With that, the new sage immediately flew towards Jiang Jueshi.
 Jiang Jueshi did not even turn his head as he said, “Go out and fight, lest you alarm all living beings. All of you can attack. Let me see my current strength!”
 His tone was calm, but his words were extremely arrogant.
 Han Jue, who was in the Daoist temple, suddenly frowned.
 Why had this fellow’s temperament changed drastically?
 He had gone astray!
 This was not stable enough!
 Jiang Jueshi and Tian Zhan arrived at the Dark Forbidden Zone. Facing each other, Tian Zhan was the first to attack. He slapped out with both hands, and his Dharmic powers transformed into the figures of countless Heavenly Race’s Heavenly Soldiers. They swept through the Dark Forbidden Zone in a mighty manner.
 Jiang Jueshi waved his sleeve and dispersed all his Dharmic powers.
 His left hand formed a seal and he slapped forward. The purple wheel shot out and almost instantly passed through space to arrive above Tian Zhan’s head.


 The purple wheel quickly descended and wrapped around Tian Zhan. He struggled with all his might and discovered that he could not break free.
 He was also a ruthless person. He directly left his body and his Sage Soul arrived behind Jiang Jueshi.
 “Hmph!”
 Tian Zhan snorted coldly and struck out with his palm. In his palm was a universe with stars that were dazzling and illusory.
 This palm struck Jiang Jueshi, causing his robes to flutter.
 In the next second, Tian Zhan was shocked to discover that his Dharmic powers had been sucked away.
 What happened?
 Jiang Jueshi turned around and struck out with his palm.
 In Tian Zhan’s eyes, this palm was extremely slow, but his reaction was even slower, as if his body was already inferior to his and he could not control it freely.
  He watched as Jiang Jueshi’s palm struck him. In a daze, he saw that Jiang Jueshi’s palm also contained a universe.
 Boom
 Tian Zhan was drowned by the terrifying purple Dharmic powers and was instantly annihilated. Only a remnant soul floated in the void after the Dharmic powers dissipated.
 Jiang Jueshi did not kill him. He turned around and looked in the direction of the Heavenly Dao.
 The Sages were stunned. It ended so quickly?
 “Hmph! I’ll do it!”
 Yang Che immediately flew out of the Heavenly Dao. How could he allow others to destroy his morale?
 However, he was defeated in less than three breaths of time.
 new
 Xu Dudao, Li Taigu, Han Yu, Tai Sutian, Primordial Chaos Buddha, and the other new Sages went forward one after another and returned in failure. Li Taigu lasted the longest, but he was defeated in less than ten breaths.
 Inside the Daoist temple.
 Han Jue was deep in thought.
 Jiang Jueshi could reflect all Mystical Powers and Dharmic powers. Furthermore, it was not as simple as that. The Great Dao Power of Time and Space around him fluctuated when he attacked.
 This was quite something.
 No wonder he was so arrogant!
 Han Jue sent a voice transmission to Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du had a strange expression and said, “Forget it, let him go.”
 The other Sages were shocked. Heavenly Venerate Wufa was about to make a move when he heard this. He glared. “Let him go just like that? Where’s the dignity of the Heavenly Dao?”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du sent a voice transmission to him. He immediately smiled and said, “Then, forget it. How can I bicker with a junior?”
 The other Sages looked at each other. What happened? Why did Heavenly Venerate Wufa change his expression so quickly?
 Jiang Jueshi cupped his hands and bowed to the Heavenly Dao. Then, he turned around and left, quickly disappearing into the darkness.
 Many Pseudo-Sages and Zenith Heaven Golden Immortals in the Heavenly Dao witnessed this scene. Jiang Jueshi’s name was deeply engraved in their hearts.
 The reason why Han Jue asked Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du to stop was to let Jiang Jueshi suffer outside. If Heavenly Venerate Wufa and Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du attacked, it would not be good and it would easily cause Jiang Jueshi to break up with the Heavenly Dao.
 “Good kid, I want to see what you can do,” Han Jue muttered to himself. His boring cultivation years were filled with joy and anticipation.
 He closed his eyes and continued cultivating.
 Jiang Jueshi’s matter was hidden by the Sages. Thousands of years later, all living beings forgot about it.
 Year after year passed.
 More than three thousand years later.
 [Detected that you are two million years old and your life has taken another step forward. You have the following choices:)
 [1: Exit seclusion immediately and spread the name of the Primordial Fiendcelestial. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment, a Creation Spirit Stone, a Heavenly Dao Spirit Stone, and a Great Dao guard.]
 [2: Cultivate in a low-profile manner and maintain your original intention. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment, a Creation Spirit Stone, and a Primordial Fragment.)
 Primordial Fragment!
 Something new finally appeared! Han Jue directly chose the second option.
 (You choose to cultivate in a low profile manner and maintain your original intention. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment, a Creation Spirit Stone, and a Primordial Fragment.)
 [Primordial Fragment: Gather all nine Primordial Fragments and you can obtain a Primordial Chaos Great Creation.]
 Han Jue was secretly puzzled. What was the Primordial Chaos Great Creation?
 [Primordial Chaos Great Creation: It can create cultivation techniques, worlds, races, and everything.)
 Creating everything!
 It sounded so cool.
  “Can I use the Primordial Chaos Great Creation to create a Creator Lord-level
 guard?”
 [No, the Primordial Chaos Creation can only create existences. All existences born have to grow slowly. They will not be higher than your cultivation level.]
 Han Jue curled his lips. That was useless.
 “Then, is the race I create only an individual or large in number?”
 [Individual, an individual who can reproduce a race.)
 Han Jue dismissed the thought of using this to create three thousand Chaotic Fiendcelestials.
 Creating everything!
 “Can I use the Primordial Chaos Great Creation to elevate my bloodline?”
 His son would be born as long as he surpassed the Primordial Fiendcelestial!
 [Yes]
 Han Jue’s eyes lit up upon seeing this word.
 Primordial Chaos Great Creation!
 How impressive!
 However, on careful thought, it would still take ten million years even if a Primordial Fragment appeared every million years.
 Han Jue calmed down and took out the Creation Spirit Stone to fuse with a ball of Fiendcelestial Qi.
 After fusing, he continued cultivating.
 Compared to the Primordial Chaos Great Creation, he had to break through to the perfected Great Dao Primordial Chaos Realm first!
 Soon!
 In the Buddhist World, dusk filled the sky like golden light. Temples floated above the clouds.
 In a huge palace, Buddhas gathered.
 Chu Shiren sat on the lotus throne. His million-foot-long body looked extremely majestic. The Buddhas looked tiny in front of him.
 Beside Chu Shiren sat a Buddha who was as tall as him.
 This Buddha was called the Sacred True Martial Buddha. He was a Freedom Sage. After entering the Buddhist World, he changed his name to Buddha.
 Chu Shiren asked, “Is Peacock really not leaving?”
 An Arhat said, “He said that he has to challenge the Sacred True Martial Buddha. Otherwise, he won’t leave.”
 The Buddhas discussed softly.
 Sacred True Martial Buddha opened his eyes and said with an indifferent expression, “Ignore him. He didn’t barge in. He must have some concerns.”
 Chu Shiren glanced at him and asked, “What are your concerns?”
 “I…”
 “He’s afraid of you? Then, why did he challenge you?”
 “Because I’m unwilling.”
 The Sacred True Martial Buddha spoke very calmly as if the peacock outside was not worth mentioning.
 At this moment, a sneer sounded.
 “Sage True Martial, you really know how to brag. Back then, did you defeat me in the Heavenly Dao?”
 It was Divine Lord Peacock!
 “Didn’t you say that you wanted to join the Heavenly Court? Why did you change your allegiance? You’re really throwing your weight around!”
 Divine Lord Peacock’s words were filled with mockery.
  Chu Shiren was expressionless and was not provoked by Divine Lord Peacock.
 Sacred True Martial Buddha said, “I didn’t win, but I broke your Five-Colored Divine Light. Is that still far from defeating you?”
 Boom
 The door of the hall was broken through by a five-colored divine light. Divine Lord Peacock walked over in the light.
 He stared at the Sacred True Martial Buddha and smiled disdainfully. “I came in. Do you think I still care about you?”
 Sacred True Martial Buddha said, “Divine Lord, must you make enemies?”
 Divine Lord Peacock said arrogantly, “I have the Dark Forbidden Lord behind me. Are you not convinced? From today onwards, the Buddhist World will be occupied by the Dark Forbidden Lord. Whoever is not convinced will die!
 “If not for the fact that you’re doing merit everywhere in the Buddhist World, I would have long charged in. Do you really think I’m afraid of you? What a joke!
 “I don’t even care about the Great Dao Sages!”


 Facing such an arrogant Divine Lord Peacock, the Sacred True Martial Buddha snorted coldly. He did not say anything else and directly escaped the Buddhist World.
 Divine Lord Peacock grinned and disappeared from the hall.
 Immediately after, a terrifying battle pressure enveloped the Buddhist World, making all the living beings feel oppressed.
 Chu Shiren frowned.
 He had heard of Divine Lord Peacock. He was known as the number one person below the Great Dao.
 With such a powerful enemy, he was also worried for the Sacred True Martial Buddha.
 Most importantly, Divine Lord Peacock represented the Dark Forbidden Lord!
 Who was the Dark Forbidden Lord?
 The most mysterious and terrifying evil existence in the Chaos!
 He was not the only one. The Buddhas in the hall were also worried.
 “The Dark Forbidden Lord is here. What should we do?”
 “It’s said that even the Dark Forbidden Lord retreats.”
 “What should we do?”
 “Sigh, but our Buddhist World doesn’t have a powerful backer.”
 “Actually, the Sacred True Martial Buddha is already very strong, but there’s always someone stronger.”
 Chu Shiren frowned slightly upon hearing the Buddhas’ words.
 He hesitated for a moment but still chose to visit Han Jue in his dreams.
 [Chu Shiren sent you a dream. Do you accept?]
 Han Jue, who was cultivating, was attracted by the notification.
 He had only been in seclusion for 27,320 years. It would be too unpleasant if he stopped now. [Chu Shiren sent you a dream. Do you accept?] [Chu Shiren sent you a dream. Do you accept?]
 Chu Shiren started to spam. Han Jue had no choice but to stop.
 This was the first time Chu Shiren was so anxious. Something had probably happened.
 Han Jue was excited.
 Could he show off now?
 Cough!
 It was time to show off!
 Han Jue chose to accept the dream.
 In the dream, Chu Shiren immediately revealed his current situation.
 “Grandmaster! The Dark Forbidden Lord has targeted me!”
 Han Jue’s expression was calm, but he was speechless inside.
 Was there something wrong with Divine Lord Peacock?
 Didn’t I ask you to find a place to enter seclusion? How dare you use my name to bully others!
 Han Jue hesitated.
 If Divine Lord Peacock directly attacked, wouldn’t that mean that he was related to the Dark Forbidden Lord?
 “I’ll think of a way.”
 With that, Han Jue ended the dream.
 He opened his eyes and looked at the Chaos. He quickly caught sight of Divine Lord Peacock and the Sacred True Martial Buddha.
 They were fighting again!
 Han Jue remembered that when Divine Lord Peacock came to the Heavenly Dao, the two of them had also fought.
 He did not attack immediately. Instead, he watched quietly and waited for Divine Lord Peacock to win before sending a dream.
 However, at first glance, it was difficult to tell who was stronger.
 Was this the Freedom Sage that Chu Shiren had roped in?
 He was indeed capable.
 Han Jue began to watch the show.
 Facing the Five-Colored Divine Light that could destroy anything, the Sacred True Martial Buddha did not use any Dharma treasures or Mystical Powers. Instead, he used his soul to constantly attack Divine Lord Peacock.
 His soul methods were endless, causing Divine Lord Peacock to be in a sorry state.
 Divine Lord Peacock might not win at this rate.
 The battle lasted for several days.
 The Sacred True Martial Buddha did not pursue. After all, he was not confident in defeating Divine Lord Peacock.
 After Divine Lord Peacock left, Han Jue didn’t visit him in his dreams immediately. He wanted to arrange a mission for this fellow to divert his attention.
 In the palace of the Buddhist World, the atmosphere was extremely oppressive.
 Sacred True Martial Buddha returned and frowned.
 Although Divine Lord Peacock was repelled, the panic brought by the Dark Forbidden Lord still enveloped them.
 Chu Shiren said expressionlessly, “Don’t panic. I’ve already informed Grandmaster. This matter will be decided by him.”
 The Buddhas were stunned and asked who his Grandmaster was.
 “Heavenly Dao, Divine Might Heavenly Sage. He once killed a Great Dao Divine Spirit and more than ten Great Dao Sages. Furthermore, he has the backing of the Fiendcelestial Race. The Chaotic Fiendcelestial previously defeated Pangu. You should have heard of it.”
 The entire palace exploded as soon as Chu Shiren finished speaking.
 It was actually the Divine Might Heavenly Sage!
 They had naturally heard of this name. It was the umbrella of the Heavenly Dao. There was no doubt about his strength!
 Sacred True Martial Buddha glanced at him and said, “You hid it well.”
 Chu Shiren said calmly, “Divine Lord Peacock has a backing, and so does the Buddhist World. I didn’t want to mention it at first and wanted to use Buddhist mantra to save the world, but sometimes, I have no choice but to use such rough methods.”
 All the Buddhas looked at him in admiration. As expected of the Buddha Lord!
 In the blink of an eye, another thirty thousand years passed.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and came to the second Dao Field. He released the nurtured Malevolent Fiendcelestial and let Murong Qi lead it away.
 After that, he did not talk nonsense with Li Yao and Dao Comprehension Sword. Instead, he returned to the main Dao Field.
 At this moment.
 The Black Hell Chicken, the Chaotic Heavenly Dog, the Three-Headed Wyrm King, Xun Chang’an, Zhou Mingyue, Ah Da, Xiao Er, Lu Huaxu, the Eight Calabash Brothers, Diamond Rage, the Black Hell Demon Lord, Tu Ling’er, and the other personal disciples were already waiting in front of the Daoist temple.
 They had all reached the Pseudo-Sage Realm!
 A total of nineteen personal disciples knelt in front of the Daoist temple, nervous and excited.
 Han Jue let them in. The Daoist temple was instantly crowded.
 “Are you ready? There will be a painful period next,” Han Jue asked.
 The nineteen personal disciples replied in unison, “We’re ready!” No one was afraid or uneasy!
 Han Jue didn’t say anything else. He directly dispersed their bodies and placed their souls into the Primordial World. He then found the Fiendcelestial Qi and fused it with them.
 With Han Jue’s current cultivation and experience, it was already very easy to fuse with the Fiendcelestial Qi. He no longer needed to be so careful.
 Next, he only needed time.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and sighed.
 He still felt a sense of achievement.
 Han Jue sent a voice transmission to Han Zuitian.
 Han Zuitian was the first transformed living being in the Hundred Peak Immortal River and was also a personal disciple. Zhou Mingyue was evacuated, so Han Jue decided to give him the authority of the Hidden Sect.
 Soon, Han Zuitian rushed over and knelt in front of him.
 He was very nervous and filled with anticipation.
  “Unknowingly, you are already a Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal. It’s time for you to shoulder the responsibility of the Hidden Sect. Are you ready?” Han Jue didn’t say anything else and went straight to the point.
 Han Zuitian’s favorability was still six stars. He was trustworthy.
 The one who contacted Li Xuan’ao the most was him.
 Han Zuitian said fearfully, “I’m afraid it’s difficult for me to withstand it. Furthermore, Master and the others are above.”
 “They’ve already left. I plan to nurture you. You’re not allowed to refuse.”
 “Ah? Thank you, Ancestor!”
 Han Zuitian suppressed his joy. He was born to love power. He was just being polite.
 Han Jue began to preach the Dao to him alone. It was a ritual to hand over power.
 Han Zuitian left a hundred years later.
 Han Jue preached the Dao to all the living beings in the Hundred Peak Immortal River. After another hundred years, he announced that Han Zuitian would be the Fourth Guardian of the Hidden Sect. From then on, he would control all the affairs in the Hundred Peak Immortal River, causing millions of disciples to be in an uproar.


 After arranging Han Zuitian’s matter, Han Jue sent a dream to Divine Lord Peacock and entered it as the Dark Forbidden Lord.
 Divine Lord Peacock opened his eyes and immediately bowed when he saw him.
 Han Jue said, “I have a mission for you.”
 Divine Lord Peacock perked up. Something had happened!
 His hands were itchy!
 Previously, he did not win when dealing with the Sacred True Martial Buddha. It made him lose face, but he did not dare to really ask the Dark Forbidden Lord for help.
 “Go ahead! I can do anything for you!”
 Divine Lord Peacock said proudly as if he had forgotten that he still had to rely on the Dark Forbidden Lord to save him.
 Han Jue said, “Attain the Dao!”
  Divine Lord Peacock was stunned.
 Han Jue said, “Your cultivation is too weak. It’s not easy to hand you missions.”
 Divine Lord Peacock was embarrassed and did not dare to refute.
 ......
 Although there were very few Great Dao Sages, from the perspective of the Dark Forbidden Lord, the Freedom Sages were indeed insufficient.
 were
 “Alright!”
 Divine Lord Peacock agreed.
 Han Jue said, “Don’t wander around for the time being. Cultivate well. There’s something important waiting for you to do after attaining the Great Dao.”
 Divine Lord Peacock nodded, feeling even more awkward.
 It seemed that the Dark Forbidden Lord already knew that he had attacked the Buddhist World.
 Sigh.
 He had embarrassed himself again.
 Han Jue didn’t say anything else and removed the dream.
 Inside the Daoist temple.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and sighed softly.
 To be honest, he was indeed a little disappointed in Divine Lord Peacock.
 This fellow seemed to be a little obsessed with his current power and forgot to work hard.
 Han Jue opened the emails and checked his recent friends.
 (Your disciple Dao Sovereign was attacked by a Primordial Heavenly Devil] x78922732
 (Your disciple Zhao Xuanyuan was attacked by a Primordial Heavenly Devil) x80020012
 [Your good friend Lao Dan was attacked by a Primordial Heavenly Devil] x50029837
 (Your good friend Jiang Jueshi was attacked by an Inauspicious Evil] x1000843
 (Your grand-disciple Murong Qi has tempered his Combat Dao heart. His cultivation has increased greatly.]
 (Your good friend Foolish Sword Sage was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure.]
 (Your enemy Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial was cursed by a mysterious curse.]
 The Chaos began to stir again!
 What was the Primordial Heavenly Devil?
 Hopefully, it was not a Chaotic force. It was probably Dao Sovereign and the other three fighting in a closed world.
 Further down, Han Jue saw a mysterious curse.
 Someone actually dared to curse the Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial.
 Is he trying to cause trouble for me?
 Han Jue was not angry. He was already used to it.
 Almost every time he read the emails, someone would be cursed by a mysterious curse. Most of the time, it was Jing Tiangong and the other believers of the Dark Forbidden Lord causing trouble.
 Strong people were everywhere.
 Han Jue continued cultivating after reading the emails.
 Next was to break through to the perfected Great Dao Primordial Chaos Realm!
 He wouldn’t stop even if the sky collapsed!
 In the mysterious void.
 Jiang Jueshi sat in a group of meteors. He deduced with both hands. Purple wheels wrapped around his body. They were mysterious and profound as if they contained the true meaning of the Great Dao.
  Suddenly!
 Jiang Jueshi suddenly opened his eyes.
 Jiang Jueshi frowned.
 A figure appeared.
 It was Shi Dudao.
 Shi Dudao was not the only one. Li Daokong and Ancestor Xitian also appeared.
 Jiang Jueshi was moved and immediately bowed. “Ancestor!”
 He had once heard Ancestor Xitian preach the Dao and could be considered to have received his favor.
 Ancestor Xitian was deep in thought.
 He carefully recalled Jiang Jieshi and quickly remembered that it was only because his cultivation level was outstanding that he could not remember if it was a Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal. This was because he had taught countless cultivators, and Jiang Jieshi had been mediocre in the past.
 Li Daokong smiled and said, “You’re also from the Heavenly Dao? Tsk tsk, you weren’t asked by the Sages to stay despite your talent?”
 Jiang Jueshi said calmly, “They can’t make me stay.”
 How arrogant!
 Shi Dudao smiled. “Let’s spar? Join us if you lose. If you win, we’ll leave immediately and not disturb you.”
 Jiang Jueshi stared at him and suddenly said, “I remember you, Shi Dudao. You were once the strongest person below the Sages of the Immortal World.”
 Shi Dudao smiled in satisfaction. “I didn’t expect you to have seen me before. It seems that you’re not as young as you look.”
 He had left the Heavenly Dao for a long time. Jiang Jueshi should not have seen him. There was only one explanation. Jiang Jueshi was not a new soul, but a reincarnated mighty figure.
 Jiang Jueshi replied, “Alright!”
 Li Daokong glanced at Shi Dudao and said, “Don’t lose. This kid is not simple.”
 He remembered Li Daokong.
 He was the eldest disciple of the Human School. However, Li Daokong did not remember him.
 The two of them were not disciples of the Human School of the same era, after all. However, Jiang Jueshi had been too mediocre in the Human School in the past and was not valued. Therefore, he paid a lot of attention to the eldest disciples. Li Muyi was considered his junior.
 “I can’t lose!”
 Shi Dudao snorted and flew towards him.
 Ancestor Xitian stared at Jiang Jueshi in deep thought.
 75,300 years later!
 Han Jue finally had the chance to break through. He didn’t stop.
 Two thousand years later, he successfully broke through!
 Perfected Great Dao Primordial Chaos Realm!
 His Dharmic powers surged!
 The long-awaited feeling fascinated Han Jue.
 What he enjoyed the most was the feeling of breaking through, surpassing all joy.
 He checked his attributes panel as he consolidated his cultivation.
 [Name: Han Jue]
 (Lifespan: 2,154,332 / 10,899,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,9 99,999]
 [Race: Primordial Fiendcelestial (Immeasurable Emperor)]
 (Cultivation: Perfected Great Dao Primordial Chaos Realm (Perfect Sage)]
 (Technique: Primordial Chaos Reincarnation Great Dao (Great Dao), Heavenly Cycle Body Tempering]
 [Great Dao: Great Dao of Life and Death, Great Dao of Karma, Great Dao of Extreme Origin]
 Three digits had appeared in front of his lifespan. Could this be considered a hundred times increase in lifespan?
 It was even more exaggerated than before!
  Han Jue suddenly regretted it.
 Should he have squandered his lifespan before breaking through?
 Forget it, he didn’t know who to curse. He should just cultivate obediently.
 Don’t cause trouble!
 Han Jue consolidated his cultivation with great satisfaction.
 Three thousand years passed quickly.
 Han Jue didn’t cultivate his Mystical Power immediately. Instead, he checked his emails to see if anything had happened in the Chaos recently.
 Soon, he was attracted by two emails.
 [Your good friend Shi Dudao was attacked by your good friend Jiang Jueshi and was severely injured.)
 (Your good friend Jiang Jueshi was attacked by your good friend Ancestor Xitian and was severely injured.]


 Why was Jiang Jueshi fighting with Ancestor Xitian?
 Shi Dudao was severely injured by him. Did that mean that Shi Dudao could not defeat him?
 Han Jue had a strange expression. He knew that Jiang Jueshi’s current potential was extremely terrifying. He didn’t expect him to even defeat Shi Dudao.
 Shi Dudao was also a prodigy and was once the number one person below the Sages!
 No matter how strong Jiang Jueshi was, he was still suppressed by Ancestor Xitian.
 Han Jue hesitated for a moment but still decided to visit Ancestor Xitian in his dreams and meet him in his true body.
 The dream was the Great Ultimate Hall back then.
 Ancestor Xitian was not surprised to see him.
 The two of them looked at each other in silence.
  Han Jue had no choice but to take the initiative to say, “Ancestor, can you not make things difficult for Jiang Jueshi?”
 Ancestor Xitian asked, “Is Jiang Jueshi related to you?”
 “Yes, he can be considered my disciple.”
 ......
 “Oh? His cultivation route doesn’t seem to have anything to do with you.”
 “Ancestor!” Han Jue raised his eyebrows and said in a heavy tone.
 Ancestor Xitian smiled. “Don’t worry. I didn’t kill him, much less hand him over to Life. Currently, he’s imprisoned in a place that’s just nice for him to settle down and cultivate. He knows too little about the Chaos. The consequences will be unimaginable if we let him continue this way.”
 Han Jue nodded in agreement.
 Ancestor Xitian changed the topic. “If he grows up, do you think he can catch up to you or even surpass you?”
 Han Jue said, “Perhaps.”
 Catch up to me?
 Impossible!
 Han Jue only dared to say this in his mind.
 “Thank you, ancestor.”
 “There’s no need to thank me. The development of the Heavenly Dao is all thanks to you. I owe you a favor.”
 The two of them exchanged a few pleasantries before Han Jue removed the dream. Han Jue opened his eyes and asked in his mind, “Is what Ancestor Xitian said true?”
 (250 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [It’s true.]
 Han Jue smiled and started to improve his Sword Dao Mystical Powers. He would cultivate the Grand Unity Aspect later.
 Five hundred years later.

 The Foolish Sword Sage in the simulation trial was still at the perfected Great Dao Primordial Chaos Realm. The five thousand strongest Great Dao Sages were extremely domineering. In the past, they had always crushed him. This time, Han Jue was stable.
 Han Jue condensed all the Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols and fought in a group.
 The disadvantage in numbers caused Han Jue to be suppressed at first, but he quickly began to reverse the situation.
 An hour later, Han Jue was still in the simulation trial.
 After a hundred simulation trials, Han Jue could already suppress five thousand Foolish Sword Sages.
 Apart from the ten thousand Divine Authority Generals, there were no more than a thousand Great Dao Sages in the entire Chaos!
 Han Jue felt that it was impossible.
 He began to increase his strength.
 Ten thousand Foolish Sword Sages!
 Ten breaths later, he opened his eyes.
 Too… strong!
 Han Jue didn’t believe it and continued fighting
 Under the dark sky, the mountains were continuous, like the back of an Earth Azure Dragon. It was magnificent and flowers did not grow.
 On a mountain peak, Jiang Jueshi meditated and deduced a Mystical Power. The purple wheel spun in front of him and changed in size.
 In the distance, on the peak of the mountain, Li Daokong and Shi Dudao were staring at him.
 Shi Dudao snorted. “This kid is really a genius.”
 Li Daokong nodded with a solemn expression.
 He did not mock him after he was defeated. His mood was even heavier than Shi Dudao’s.
  He had never defeated Shi Dudao.
 Jiang Jueshi was not arrogant. No matter how they watched, he was indifferent.
 Shi Dudao suddenly disappeared and reappeared at Jiang Jueshi’s side.
 Although he often pestered Shi Dudao, the two of them had experienced life and death and were already like brothers. They naturally could not stand by and watch when the other faced troubles.
 Jiang Jueshi continued to deduce the Mystical Power and did not care about them.
 Shi Dudao asked, “What cultivation technique are you cultivating?”
 Jiang Jueshi replied, “Great Reincarnation Creation Technique.”
 “I created it myself.”
 “Self-created…”
 Shi Dudao was moved.
 Li Daokong was the same. His expression changed drastically.
 Shi Dudao asked, “This technique is a Great Dao?”
 “I don’t know what the Great Dao is.”
 “Hehe.”
 Shi Dudao smiled and disappeared.
 Li Daokong did not stay any longer.
 From the beginning to the end, Jiang Jueshi did not open his eyes.
 He had lost interest in them ever since he defeated Shi Dudao.
 He never cared about his defeated foes.
 After a long while…
 Jiang Jueshi opened his eyes again and frowned.
 “This feeling… Who is… my fated enemy?” Jiang Jueshi muttered to himself with a confused expression.
 Second Dao Field.
 Han Jue came to the Daoist temple and waved his sleeve to release a group of people.
 The aura of Chaotic Fiendcelestials attracted the other Fiendcelestials in the Dao Field. Li Yao and Dao Comprehension Sword also left the temple.
 The other personal disciples were also very excited.
 Especially when they saw Murong Qi, Guan Bubai, and the others, they were very proud.
 Who asked you to show off in the Myriad Worlds Projection!
 Now we’re here too!
 Han Jue didn’t stay any longer and returned to the main Dao Field.
 It was time to continue cultivating!
 He was not far from the Great Dao Supreme Realm after reaching the perfected Great Dao Primordial Chaos Realm!
 Han Jue had been looking forward to this realm.
 Only by reaching the Great Dao Supreme Realm could he be fearless.
 In the Chaos, other than the illusory Chaotic Consciousness, only a Great Dao Supreme was above humans and gods.
 In a huge palace, the Divine Robe Daoist sat on a throne. His posture was lazy and his expression was slightly disdainful.
 Dozens of figures knelt in the hall. The leader was a green-robed Daoist.
 The green-robed Daoist said, “What do you think, Exalted God?”
 The Divine Robe Daoist snorted. “I’m not the Divine Might Heavenly Sage’s match. We finally turned hostility into friendship, and you want me to deal with him again?”
 He was already thinking about how to deal with these people in the hall.
 The green-robed Daoist said, “I have a Supreme Treasure in my possession. It can crush the Heavenly Dao in one strike and erase its karma.”
  The Divine Robe Daoist said, “Can that kill the Divine Might Heavenly Sage?”
 The green-robed Daoist said, “Yes!”
 “Since you can kill, why are you looking for me?”
 “We need a reason to attack.”
 “Oh?”
 “So confident? Won’t you be able to kill me if you can kill the Mighty Heavenly Sage?”
 The Divine Robe Daoist smiled faintly, his eyes already filled with killing intent.
 The green-robed Daoist was silent for a moment before saying, “Yes!”
 With that said, the atmosphere in the entire hall instantly froze as killing intent surged.
