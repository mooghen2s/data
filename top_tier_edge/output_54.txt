 Daoist Dragon Head fell silent upon learning that he had not encountered the Divine Might Heavenly Sage.
 Impossible!
 Daoist Dragon Head was shocked.
 There was such an expert under the Divine Might Heavenly Sage?
 He suddenly felt glad that he did not go rashly and had a way to revive. Otherwise, he might have died in the Heavenly Dao.
 Seeing that he was silent, the Divine Robe Daoist revealed a mocking expression.
 Even the Divine Authority Generals can’t enter the Heavenly Dao. Who do you think you
Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎 are?
 After a long while…
  ...
 Daoist Dragon Head looked up and said, “Exalted God, have you made up with the Heavenly Dao?”
 He was not stupid. Thinking about it carefully, the Divine Robe Daoist’s tone was more like he was protecting the Heavenly Dao.
 The Divine Robe Daoist did not say anything.
 ......
 “Why don’t you introduce me to the Heavenly Dao?” Daoist Dragon Head asked.
 The Divine Robe Daoist was stunned.
 This fellow…
 Daoist Dragon Head said seriously, “Since I can’t defeat them, I’ll join the Heavenly Dao. There shouldn’t be an existence stronger than the Divine Might Heavenly Sage in the current Chaos, right? As for the previous Ultimate God of Punishment, in my opinion, he’s only so-so. After all, the leader of the Divine Spirits doesn’t dare to attack the Divine Might Heavenly Sage.”
 The Divine Robe Daoist asked expressionlessly, “So, why would you join the Heavenly Dao?”
 The Divine Robe Daoist naturally had to think of a way to resolve it if this fellow wanted to scheme against the Heavenly Dao.
 Speaking of which, his help to Han Jue was minimal. At most, he would inform the Heavenly Dao and take care of it. However, the Heavenly Dao itself had Han Jue, and its rise was already unstoppable.
 Daoist Dragon Head felt that it made sense and agreed. “Alright, I’ll go to the Three Pure Sacred World first.”
 With that, Daoist Dragon Head turned around and left.
 Upon reaching the door, he suddenly stopped and turned his head to say meaningfully, “Exalted God, the Primordial Fiendcelestial might be fake, but the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity is not fabricated. You should make plans early.”
 With that, Daoist Dragon Head vanished.
 The Divine Robe Daoist frowned.
 He originally thought that with the death of the Chaotic Fiendcelestials and the leader of the Divine Spirits, the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity would not happen. After all, the Chaos had already acknowledged that the Primordial Fiendcelestial was only a legend.
 However, Daoist Dragon Head’s words caused him to hesitate.
 This fellow was too strange.
 It was as if he knew nothing about the Chaos and thought that he could challenge the strongest by attaining the Great Dao.
 Could he have been in seclusion somewhere for nearly a million years?
 Then, who was his master?
 The Divine Robe Daoist frowned and fell into deep thought.
 In the void.
 Jiang Jueshi moved forward quickly, his white clothes fluttering with the wind. There were no traces of him around him. It was as if time had passed. His temperament became more and more extraordinary.
 A dazzling universe appeared in front of him. Countless galaxies were dotted with starlight, as beautiful as a painting.
 Jiang Jueshi was attracted by this universe.
 For some reason, he felt that something was beckoning him in this universe.
 He immediately accelerated.
 This universe was the universe of stars created by Han Jue. He had been waiting for Jiang Jueshi to take the bait.
 Jiang Jueshi quickly advanced and entered the universe of stars.
 He wandered around, his Sage Sense sweeping through the universe.
 At the same time.
 In the center of the universe of stars, in the third arena.
 Liu Bei noticed Jiang Jueshi’s arrival. He stared at him with a vigilant expression.
 After all, this universe was newly developed and could not withstand the destruction of
 outsiders.
 Liu Bei could sense that Jiang Jueshi was very strong and didn’t dare to speak rashly. Besides, he didn’t have to worry with Han Jue around.
 He was curious about what Jiang Jueshi would do.
 After wandering around the universe of stars for a period of time, Jiang Jueshi found a place to cultivate in seclusion.
 Time passed.
 In the blink of an eye, Han Jue’s hundred thousand years of seclusion arrived.
 He had long sensed Jiang Jueshi’s arrival, but he was not in a hurry. Instead, he headed to the second Dao Field, released the newly born Fiendcelestials, and preached the Dao to them.
 Five hundred years passed.
 Han Jue returned to the third Dao Field.
 He walked out of the Daoist temple and appeared in front of Liu Bei.
 “What do you think of that kid?” Han Jue asked.
 Liu Bei opened his eyes and was stunned. Then, he understood that Han Jue was talking about the cultivator who had accidentally entered the universe of stars.
 “He seems to be a Heavenly Dao lifeform too?” Liu Bei asked carefully.
 Jiang Jueshi’s Heavenly Dao providence was dense. After all, it had settled for more than ten thousand years. It was not so easy to dissipate it.
 “Not bad. He didn’t destroy the place wantonly. Instead, he found a place and entered seclusion quietly. He probably has a cautious and ascetic personality.” Liu Bei deliberated.
 Han Jue told him about his past with Jiang Jueshi. Liu Bei was moved.
 This child’s talent is so terrifying?
 Liu Bei asked, “What do you need me to do?”
 Han Jue must have something to tell him.
 “You can befriend him and make him stay here.” Han Jue smiled.
 The Spirit Qi here was still too weak and there was insufficient Chaotic Qi. Jiang Jueshi probably couldn’t stay for long.
 Liu Bei immediately agreed.
 Han Jue sent a wisp of his will into the tree. “In the future, just say the word when you enter or leave.”
 This will was especially responsible for letting Liu Bei in and out.
 “Alright!” Liu Bei replied and watched him leave.
 He finally had a hint of understanding of the power of creation after hundreds of thousands of years.
 Everything was difficult at the beginning!
 Han Jue was very excited and felt that there was hope of breaking through to the mid-stage of the Great Dao Supreme Realm.
 More than three thousand years later.
 (The Evil Heavenly Emperor sent you a dream. Do you accept?]
 Han Jue opened his eyes and silently chose to accept.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor rarely looked for him unless there was something important.
 Han Jue was secretly looking forward to it.
 Would he ask for help?
 Very few could match Han Jue in the current Chaos.
 It would be a beautiful thing if he could show his divinity.
 The dream was still the forest outside the Jade Pure Sacred Sect.
  The Evil Heavenly Emperor saw him and smiled. “How have you been?”
 “Not bad. What is it?”
 Han Jue went straight to the point.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor was secretly puzzled by his attitude. “The head of the Divine Spirits has perished. He created the Primordial Divine Clan. This race might threaten you.”
 Han Jue said, “That’s it? No, wait. Why did the leader of the Divine Spirits die?”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor rolled his eyes. “Stop pretending. You must have known long ago. If I didn’t know who killed him, I would probably think that you did it yourself.”
 Han Jue shook his head. “How is that possible? The ten-million-year promise isn’t over yet.”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor said, “I came to find you today because I have something to ask of you.”
 Han Jue’s eyes lit up.


 “What is it?” Han Jue asked patiently. He blamed the Evil Heavenly Emperor in his heart.
 What’s our relationship? Do you have to beat around the bush?
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor said, “I’m preparing to explore the Chaotic Domain. I already have a goal. However, this domain has a powerful restriction and needs the help of a Great Dao Sage. I only know two Great Dao Sages. One is suppressed and the other has disappeared. I can only look for you.”
 Speaking of this, the Evil Heavenly Emperor sighed.
 Han Jue said, “Summon me.”
 “Alright!”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor did not say anything else. The dream ended.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and asked in his mind, “Will I die if I help the Evil Heavenly Emperor?”
 (300 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
  Continue!
 ...
 (No]
 Safe.
 Han Jue was relieved. In any case, he had left his will in the Daoist temple. He could be revived even if he died outside. The question just now was mainly to consider if he would provoke a Great Dao Supreme existence. But it shouldn’t be from the question’s value.

 The Evil Heavenly Emperor used the Invocation Technique to summon him several days later.
 A black vortex appeared in front of Han Jue and he stepped in.
 In an instant, he arrived in the Chaos.
 He stepped out of the black vortex and saw the Evil Heavenly Emperor.
 Beside him stood a man in silver armor. His aura was oppressive.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor immediately smiled upon seeing him. He cupped his fists and smiled. “It’s my honor to have the Divine Might Heavenly Sage’s help.”
 Behind the two of them stood rows of Heavenly troops. There were at least ten million of them.
 All the immortals of the Heavenly Court looked at Han Jue in reverence. The name of the Divine Might Heavenly Sage had long spread throughout the Chaos. He had killed 20,000 Divine Authority Generals with a single strike, which was equivalent to 20,000 Great Dao Sages being no match for him. Such strength was considered unique in the eyes of all living beings. He was even regarded as the strongest by many cultivators. He was so powerful that even the rules could not restrain him.
 Han Jue said, “You’re still talking about these formalities. Could it be that His Majesty wants to flatter me?”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor smiled. “I have no choice. The Divine Might Heavenly Sage’s name is too grand. I don’t dare to be impudent. Let me introduce you. The person beside me is called the War Buddha, a Buddhist spirit from the Buddhist World. He’s Chu Shiren’s disciple and also your grand-disciple.”
 Hearing this, the silver-armored man beside him hurriedly bowed very respectfully.
 Han Jue glanced at the War Buddha and said, “Your potential is not bad. I’ll teach you a Mystical Power after this matter is over.”
 “Thank you, Heavenly Sage!” the War Buddha said excitedly and hurriedly bowed.
 “Oh?” Han Jue raised his eyebrows and looked unhappy. The War Buddha was stunned. “Thank you, Grandmaster!”
 wa
 Han Jue finally smiled.
 The Heavenly troops behind them were in an uproar.
 They didn’t expect the Divine General to be the Divine Might Heavenly Sage’s grand-disciple!
 Han Jue turned around and looked at the void ahead.
 He already felt a powerful restriction that even ordinary Great Dao Sages would probably find difficult to break.
 He used the simulation trial and did not discover any powerful enemies.
 “How is it? Can you break it?” the Evil Heavenly Emperor asked with a solemn expression.
 Han Jue didn’t answer. He just took out the Primordial Judgment Sword and slashed out.
 Without the sword Qi, the void in front of him was instantly slashed into two. A white light split the darkness into two. Immediately after, it began to shatter with the white light as the center.
 Boom
 Space shattered and violent winds wreaked havoc. The Great Dao lightning was extremely domineering.
 Han Jue raised his hand and easily blocked all the wind and lightning for the Heavenly Court.
 The space ahead began to collapse as seven-colored light burst forth.
 Han Jue narrowed his eyes and looked over. A world was revealed after the restriction shattered.
  This world was vast, a hundred times larger than the entire Heavenly Dao. Boundless vitality spread out, making one intoxicated.
 Han Jue scanned with his Sage Sense and discovered countless living beings in this world, but no Sages. The strongest was only a Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal.
 There were many Zenith Heaven Golden Immortals, but they did not transform. They were like ferocious beasts walking on the ground.
 “That’s right, the legendary first world of the Chaos!” the Evil Heavenly Emperor said excitedly. Han Jue glanced at him in surprise.
 “Although the Immortal World is not the first world, with the rules of the Heavenly Dao, it has already surpassed the first world of the Chaos.”
 Han Jue asked, “How did you find this place?”
 The Chaos had countless such restrictions. Under normal circumstances, even Great Dao Sages did not dare to rashly barge in. They were probably the Dao Field of other Great Dao Sages. How could the Evil Heavenly Emperor predict that there was no Dao Field behind the restriction?
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor smiled. “Of course, I was guided by an ancient existence. However, I can’t tell you this ancient existence’s name.”
 nan
 Han Jue’s expression didn’t change, but he was shocked.
 Could it be the Chaotic Consciousness?
 “Thank you, Heavenly Sage. There’s no need to trouble you next. In the future, the Heavenly Dao’s Chaotic Heavenly Road can also be expanded here and teach the living beings here.” The Evil Heavenly Emperor smiled.
 Han Jue nodded and stepped into the black vortex. A beam of light flew out and entered the War Buddha’s forehead before he disappeared.
 The black vortex disappeared.
 Han Jue had already returned to the third Dao Field.
 He sat on the mat and first used the simulation trial to check his surroundings. He was only relieved after confirming that no mysterious existence followed him to the Dao Field.
 Han Jue asked in his mind, “Who told the Evil Heavenly Emperor about that world just now?”
 (1 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Dao Creator!
 Continue!
 [Formless Transcendent Deity: Cultivation unknown, Chaotic Deity, Above Order, Transcends Everything. Unspeakable Name.]
 It was actually not the Chaotic Consciousness…
 Han Jue frowned.
 He asked, “How many Dao Creators are there?”
 Could it be that there were seven like the Supreme Rules?
 (1 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 (Five]
 Han Jue was deep in thought.
 Ninth Chaos, Chaotic Consciousness, Formless Transcendent Deity, and two unknown existences.
 It was not many, but it was not few either.
 Furthermore, the five of them had already escaped the Chaos. All living beings didn’t know this.
 Han Jue asked again, “Be it in the Chaos or outside, is the Ninth Chaos the strongest existence?”
 (100 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue! [For the time being.) It should be now.
  Han Jue set a goal to surpass the Ninth Chaos.
 The ceiling was right in front of him!
 However, the Ninth Chaos was not his ultimate goal. He still had to break through to the Creator Lord Realm after surpassing the Ninth Chaos.
 He wanted to constantly rise to newer heights!
 Han Jue was excited just thinking about it.
 Wait.
 The Formless Transcendent Deity told the Evil Heavenly Emperor about the number one world of the Chaos. Was he going to interfere in the situation of the Chaos?
 That had to be the case!
 Han Jue asked in his mind, “Why did the Formless Transcendent Deity help the Evil Heavenly Emperor?”
 (1 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]


 Continue!
 Han Jue wanted to see what the Formless Transcendent Deity was scheming.
 With that, Han Jue entered the illusion.
 He opened his eyes. It was absolutely dark around him. A light suddenly appeared ahead.
 The light became brighter and brighter. Han Jue looked carefully and discovered that the light came from the glabella of a majestic figure. He couldn’t see the other party’s face clearly and could only see his figure. He seemed to be wearing a robe and sitting in the darkness.
 Formless Transcendent Deity?
 Han Jue was secretly shocked.
 He couldn’t see the other party’s true appearance even after spending a quadrillion years of his lifespan!
 At this moment, Han Jue suddenly felt a movement behind him. He turned around and saw a terrifying figure ten thousand times larger than the Buzhou Divine Mountain behind him.
  This figure floated in the void. He raised his left leg slightly and placed his palms in front of his chest. However, there were countless arms behind him, with as many branches as a huge tree. Han Jue couldn’t see his true appearance, either.
 ...
 “The Primordial Fiendcelestial has yet to be born. Perhaps a variable will appear in the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity.”
 “I think so, too. I’ve decided to release the Heavenly Ruins Divine World. Perhaps the Primordial Fiendcelestial will be born from
 it.”
 “Yes, that’s settled. That Evil Heavenly Emperor can use it well. It’s also a fortuitous encounter for him. Perhaps he can grasp it.”

 “Mm.”
 The two transcendent existences chatted for a while before the illusion shattered.
 Han Jue opened his eyes.
 Although he had said little just now, he had revealed a lot of information.
 The Dao Creator seemed to want the Primordial Fiendcelestial to be born!
 Han Jue had no intention of telling the Evil Heavenly Emperor about this. The difference in cultivation level was too great. The more he knew, the more dangerous it would be.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor definitely knew that the other party had ulterior motives, but just as that transcendent existence had said, although the Evil Heavenly Emperor was being used, it was also an opportunity for
 him.
 If there was no Formless Transcendent Deity, the Evil Heavenly Emperor could only cause a small splash in the Chaos and not cause a storm no matter how much he struggled.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor who had obtained the Heavenly Ruins Divine World would definitely rise after the Formless Transcendent Deity’s guidance.
 Han Jue stopped thinking.
 The current him was not qualified to scheme against a Dao Creator.
 He had to reach the Dao Creator Realm first.
 Primordial Chaos Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal, Freedom Primordial Chaos Realm, Great Dao Primordial Chaos Realm, Great Dao Supreme Realm, Dao Creator Realm!
 Every realm was the difference between immortals and mortals!
 Time passed quickly.
 Three hundred thousand years passed in the blink of an eye.
 The Immortal World had also changed drastically. Countless races and cultivation were prevalent. To all living beings in the Immortal World, Zenith Heaven Golden Immortals were no longer illusory. At the very least, they were existences that they could often hear about.
 Below the Immortal World, the number of mortal worlds had already reached 100,000. The number was still increasing. Without the Immeasurable Calamity and with too many providence sects running rampant, only by creating a mortal world would it be easiest to obtain great providence and merit.
 Under the rule of Li Xuan’ao and Han Zuitian, the Hidden Sect still maintained its original rhythm, powerful and low profile.
 Han Jue stayed in the third Dao Field. The disciples of the Hundred Peak Immortal River and the second Dao Field didn’t disturb him, so his cultivation was very smooth.
 He suddenly opened his eyes one day.
 His gaze passed through the universe and landed on a huge star.
  Jiang Jueshi and Liu Bei were discussing the
 Dao.
 At first, Jiang Jueshi was wary of Liu Bei. However, he let down his guard when he discovered that Liu Bei indeed had no ill intentions.
 Han Jue was very satisfied with Jiang Jueshi. This kid had already reached the early stage of the Freedom Primordial Chaos Realm. His potential was indeed impressive.
 What he had to do now was to keep Jiang Jueshi by his side.
 It was not that one could survive in the Chaos just because they had good potential. Otherwise, after so long, there would not be so few Great Dao Sages.
 Han Jue looked at him for a while before looking away and checking his emails. [Your good friend Lao Dan was attacked by the Fiendcelestial Vengeful Spirit] x78203932
 Aas
 (Your disciple Dao Sovereign was attacked by the Fiendcelestial Vengeful Spirit] x90827631
 [Your good friend Evil Heavenly Emperor has grasped the providence of the Heavenly Ruins Divine World.]
 [Your son Han Tuo has grasped the Divine Authority. His providence has increased greatly.]
 [Your good friend Yi Tian has grasped the Divine Authority. His providence has increased greatly.)
 [Your good friend Zhou Fan refined your enemy, Seven Dao Sage, into a divine weapon. His cultivation has increased greatly.]
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor was so fast!
 He had fused with the providence of the Heavenly Ruins Divine World so quickly. The Formless Transcendent Deity probably helped him.
 Further down, Han Jue was attracted by Zhou Fan.
 What was this fellow doing?
 He checked his interpersonal relationships. Seven Dao Sage’s portrait was still there. He had not died.
 Han Jue pinched his fingers to deduce and discovered that Zhou Fan didn’t face resistance when he refined the Seven Dao Sage. It was the Seven Dao Sage’s idea.
 He suddenly couldn’t understand their relationship.
 After thinking about it, Han Jue still sent a dream to Zhou Fan.
 In the dream.
 Zhou Fan opened his eyes and immediately bowed when he saw him.
 Without waiting for Han Jue to speak, Zhou Fan took out a long weapon. The two ends of the weapon were like truncheons, and seven thin patterns surrounded it. They meandered on the body of the weapon, looking very mysterious.
 “Master, this weapon is a Seven Dao Divine Weapon. I refined it with the Seven Dao Sage and it contains the power of seven Great Dao. How about that?” Zhou Fan asked proudly.
 This was a dream. The Seven Dao Divine Weapon was only a phantom. Its power couldn’t be seen.
 Han Jue asked, “Why is Seven Dao Sage willing to let you refine it?”
 Zhou Fan said, “He’s afraid of you. Not only is he afraid of you, but he’s also afraid of other existences. He decided to change his identity, so he helped me.”
 “Help you?”
  Zhou Fan was very pleased.
 Han Jue didn’t want to discourage him and asked, “What do you plan to do?”
 Zhou Fan left with the Great Dao Tower and continued to wander the Chaos after the Divine Authority Generals were destroyed.
 Zhou Fan replied, “I don’t want to be like Chu Shiren and create a world. I also don’t want to be like the Evil Heavenly Emperor and recruit troops and attack everywhere. I want to explore the Chaos and spread my reputation.”
 Han Jue said, “How can you cultivate by wandering around?”
 Zhou Fan chuckled, “The stronger the Great Dao Tower is, the stronger I am.”
 Han Jue didn’t ask anymore and prepared to remove the dream.
 “Master, I recently obtained information from the Great Dao Tower about the Primordial Fiendcelestial. Do you want to know?” Zhou Fan leaned forward and asked mysteriously.
 Han Jue raised his eyebrows. “Go ahead.”
 Zhou Fan said, “The Primordial Fiendcelestial is fake news. The Chaos is really afraid of another existence. Some supreme existences want to nurture the Primordial Fiendcelestial to resist him.”


 “Who is the other existence?” Han Jue asked. Did Zhou Fan want to keep him in suspense?
 This kid had really grown up!
 Sensing Han Jue’s dissatisfied gaze, Zhou Fan hurriedly replied, “I’m not sure, either. Anyway, there’s such an existence that needs the Primordial Fiendcelestial to resist it.”
 Han Jue was deep in thought.
 Could it be him after his bloodline evolved?
 If nothing went wrong, his Primordial Fiendcelestial bloodline would evolve and definitely affect the future in a few million years.
 Han Jue asked in his mind, “Is the other existence Zhou Fan mentioned to me after my bloodline evolved?”
 (10 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 .
 (Yes]
 ...
 I see.
 Han Jue secretly heaved a sigh of relief.
 When he evolved, he would directly let his youngest son be born and intercept the position of the Primordial Fiendcelestial. This way, the Chaos wouldn’t give birth to a second Primordial Fiendcelestial.
 He would have one less potential enemy without a second Primordial Fiendcelestial!

 Perfect!
 The more Han Jue thought about it, the happier he became, but he remained calm on the surface.
 He asked, “The Great Dao Tower is so powerful. Are you sure you can control it? There are no other transcendent existences behind it? Have you thought about who created the Great Dao Tower?”
 The Great Dao Tower could even predict the future changes caused by a Great Dao Supreme. It was indeed not simple.
 “I’ve also been worried about this, but currently, I’ve already fused with the Great Dao Tower and don’t sense anything amiss. Besides, how can there be no danger? Any opportunity is like this. As long as one is too powerful, they will definitely be coveted by mighty figures.”
 Zhou Fan said seriously, “Master, don’t worry. I know what to do. I’ll definitely look for you if I really encounter trouble.”
 He could hear Han Jue’s concern, so he answered accordingly.
 Han Jue said, “As long as you know.”
 With that, he removed the dream.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and muttered, “I still have to focus on cultivation.”
 He had already gathered nine Primordial Fragments. He wanted to release his youngest son as soon as possible to prevent anyone from really transforming into a Primordial Fiendcelestial.
 In the blue sky, layers of clouds and countless circular stone platforms floated in the air.
 Han Tuo, Yi Tian, and the other three Great Dao Divine Spirits stood side by side on one of the stone platforms.
 They all looked in one direction, waiting for the arrival of the Ultimate God of Punishment.
 After a while.
 A black light descended in front of them.
 The Ultimate God of Punishment’s voice came from the black light, “I’m giving you a mission.”
 Han Tuo cupped his fists and said, “Leader, please speak.”
 The other four also bowed. They were already used to their new identities as the Five Great Divine Punishers. All these years, the Ultimate God of Punishment had treated them well and had even taught them Mystical Powers. It was time to repay him.
 “I want you to visit all the Great Dao Divine Spirits. You can inspect whatever you want. You only need to walk around.”
 The Ultimate God of Punishment’s voice sounded again. Hearing this, the five Divine Punishers immediately accepted the order.
 The black light vanished. The Ultimate God of Punishment did not appear from the beginning to the end.
 Han Tuo and the others turned around and left.
 Nearly four hundred thousand years passed quickly.
 On this day.
 .
 A notification appeared in front of Han Jue.
 [Detected that you are five million years old and your life has taken another step forward. You have the following choices:)
 (1: Exit seclusion immediately and promote the reputation of the Primordial Fiendcelestial. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment, a Heavenly Dao Spirit Stone, a Creation Spirit Stone, and a Primordial Fragment.]
 [2: Cultivate in a low-profile manner and stay away from trouble. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment, a Creation Spirit Stone, and a Primordial Fragment.]
 This time, the system acted mischievously again. There was an additional reward on the first option.
 Unfortunately, Han Jue wouldn’t be fooled.
 He silently chose the second option.
 At this point, he already had eight Great Dao Fragments and six Primordial Fragments!
 Perhaps his Stellar Primordial Body would transform in another three million years.
 Han Jue took out the Creation Spirit Stone and fused it with a ball of Fiendcelestial Qi.
 He finally saw the hope of breaking through after so many years of cultivation.
 The Primordial World had yet to reach its limit. As the nebulous Primordial Qi in it increased, Han Jue’s Supreme Power kept increasing. He was probably at most five hundred thousand years away from breaking through.
 He was very satisfied with his cultivation speed.
 Look at the Foolish Sword Sage. He was still at the early stage of the Great Dao Supreme Realm.
 Han Jue visited Divine Lord Peacock in his dreams.
 After Han Jue attained the Great Dao, the Chaos finally gave birth to a new Great Dao Sage after so many years. It was obvious how difficult achieving the Great Dao Realm was.
 In the dream.
 Divine Lord Peacock opened his eyes and saw the pitch-black Han Jue. He was immediately pleasantly surprised and hurriedly knelt down.
 He was secretly shocked.
 It was still so difficult for him to sense the legendary dream of the Dark Forbidden Lord even after reaching the Great Dao Realm.
 “Although it was a little slow, you succeeded,” Han Jue said with a slightly praising tone, making Divine Lord Peacock feel ashamed.
 Divine Lord Peacock hurriedly asked, “Forbidden Lord, what do you need me to do? Just tell me!”
 Han Jue said, “Cultivate for the time being. I’ll preach the Dao for you. The Great Dao Realm can’t be your end.”
 With that, he began to preach the Great Dao of Extreme Origin.
 Han Jue controlled the time as he preached the Dao in the dream. It seemed like ten thousand years had passed, but only a day had passed in reality.
 The dream had already ended when Divine Lord Peacock opened his eyes.
 He was excited.
 On the other side, Han Jue opened his eyes and started to check his emails.
 Regarding the rules of time, Han Jue couldn’t use them on himself or speed up the time process of the entire Heavenly Dao. After all, the Heavenly Dao didn’t belong to him.
 Time was among the Seven Supreme Rules. However, the definition of time was different from what mortals thought. It was the same as the continuation of the power of creation. The transmission speed of the power of creation was still constant even if the mighty figures accelerated the time of their domain. Therefore, controlling time was meaningless to the mighty figures. However, time was very terrifying to all living beings who did not rely on the power of creation.
 The emails accumulated over four hundred thousand years were still very abundant. Han Jue read them with relish.
 In short, the Chaos was still peaceful. No major battles occurred.
 Han Jue looked at the third Dao Field after reading the emails.
 The universe of stars was still silent, but the third Dao Field was already covered in flowers and plants, like a paradise.
 Han Jue raised his hand and took out a ball of soul.
 It was the soul of Han Tuo’s mother, Qingluan’er.


 Han Jue naturally had a plan now that he took out Qingluan’er’s soul.
 Good things should not go to outsiders.
 Moreover, Qingluan’er would definitely think of a way to keep up with his immortality if she revived. Otherwise, what was the point of reviving? Han Jue didn’t lack women.
 Han Jue began to use the power of creation.
 Qingluan’er’s soul was intact. She only needed to recover her body.
 That day, Qingluan’er’s body was created and she became an Immortal Emperor.
 .
 Her body wouldn’t be able to withstand her soul if her cultivation was lower.
 ...
 Qingluan’er lay on the bed in white clothes. They were casually created by Han Jue.
 She slowly opened her eyes, her gaze confused.
 Memories surged from the depths of her mind, causing her eyes to widen.
 “Was I… reincarnated?” Qingluan’er muttered to herself. She subconsciously raised her hand and discovered that she was not a baby.

 What happened?
 She wanted to sit up, but she accidentally broke through the Daoist temple and landed in the sky.
 “What’s going on… This spirit energy…”
 Qingluan’er widened her beautiful eyes and sized up her body in disbelief.
 She could feel a surging power in her body. She couldn’t help but think of spirit energy.
 Although she was a mortal in the past, she knew about cultivation.
 She looked down and discovered a Daoist temple on the vast mountain. After she broke through the top, it was recovering from an illusion.
 “Could it be that I did not die?”
 Qingluan’er frowned and tried her best to control her body to slowly land.
 She carefully walked into the Daoist temple and asked, “Is anyone here?”
 Crack
 The door to the Daoist temple suddenly opened. Unable to see the situation inside, Qingluan’er became even more nervous, not daring to enter rashly.
 In the Daoist temple, Han Jue stood up and tidied his clothes.
 If he had not reacted quickly, Qingluan’er would have been lost. The Daoist temple was not brittle enough for an Immortal Emperor to destroy.
 Han Jue waited for a while. Qingluan’er had yet to enter, so he had no choice but to raise his hand and suck her in.
 Qingluan’er couldn’t control her body and was sucked into the Daoist temple.
 Terror and despair filled her heart.
 She subconsciously closed her eyes. When she landed on the ground, she opened her eyes and was stunned.
 “Hus-Husband?” Qingluan’er shouted in surprise and rubbed her eyes.
 Han Jue smiled. “What? Are you still afraid of me? If not for me, who can help you revive?”
 Qingluan’er immediately put down her doubts and pounced into his arms when she heard that.
 “Husband, am I dreaming? You really revived me? Also, why are you so young?”
 Qingluan’er kept asking. She had too many questions.
 .
 Han Jue pulled her to a seat and explained, “I was in pain after you died. I wanted to wait and die of old age. I didn’t expect to encounter an immortal and obtain the opportunity to cultivate. After millions of years of cultivation, I created a world and obtained a great opportunity before reviving you.”
 “Wait! Millions of years?”
 Qingluan’er was shocked and looked incredulous.
 Han Jue said, “That’s right. About five million years have passed. We’re no longer in the Immortal World.”
 Qingluan’er hurriedly asked, “What about Tuo’er?”
 Han Jue remained silent.
 Qingluan’er’s face instantly turned pale. She asked with a trembling voice, “He’s already… right… after so many years, even immortals have to die…”
 Han Jue sighed. “He’s not dead.”
 “Huh?”
 Qingluan’er’s tears stopped.
 Han Jue said helplessly, “He’s still alive, but he’s already grown up. He naturally won’t follow me. He even has descendants.”
 Qingluan’er punched him and said coquettishly, “Husband, you’re teasing me.”
 Qingluan’er was overjoyed upon learning that her son was still alive.
 She believed Han Jue. After all, children had to grow up and live their own lives. She didn’t stay by her parents’ side back then, either.
 “Tell me about your experiences over the years.” Qingluan’er pulled his hand and urged.
 Han Jue said, “Let’s talk about it in the future. Get used to your Dharmic powers first.”
 Then, he began to teach her.
 Qingluan’er’s body was in its prime. In addition to Han Jue, her hundred years of experience were not worth mentioning. Soon, she regained the mentality of a young woman and even acted coquettishly.
 A year passed in the blink of an eye.
 Most importantly, she knew that she and her husband could still rely on each other for countless years.
 She even felt like she was dreaming.
 On this day, the two of them put on their clothes and sat by the bed.
 Han Jue said, “Alright, I should cultivate too. I need to cultivate in seclusion for a hundred thousand years each time. Don’t disturb me if there’s nothing important. You can wander outside, but you can only stay within a radius of a million miles. This is my Dao Field and is isolated from the outside world. You can’t go out even if you want to.”
 “Ah? A hundred thousand years?”
 Qingluan’er was stunned.
 Han Jue ignored her and closed his eyes.
 The reason he hid the truth from Qingluan’er was that he couldn’t be bothered to explain. Furthermore, he wanted to create a sense of urgency so that Qingluan’er could cultivate in peace.
 As for Xing Hongxuan, Xuan Qingjun, and the other women, Han Jue was not worried that Qingluan’er would mind their existence. Back when the two of them were in the mortal world, Qingluan’er had taken the initiative to take in a concubine for him, but he had rejected her.
 Time passed year after year.
 Qingluan’er was a little impatient after cultivating in seclusion for a few years. Thus, she wandered outside the Daoist temple for a few days before returning to continue cultivating
 She finally began to get used to the boring cultivation after a thousand years.
  In the void.
 The five Divine Punishers stepped on the divine light and advanced. Han Tuo stood at the front and frowned.
 Yi Tian walked to his side and asked in a low voice, “You seem to be uneasy recently?”
 Han Tuo said, “Indeed. For some reason, I keep feeling a familiar aura, but I can’t be sure who it is.”
 He frowned. He had never felt this way.
 “Could it be that your younger brother has broken through?” Yi Tian asked teasingly.
 Back then, Han Tuo felt uneasy because of that mysterious younger brother and had no choice but to ask the Evil Heavenly Emperor to question that unknown transcendent existence.
 He smiled and said, “I wonder what realm my younger brother is at now.”
 Yi Tian smiled. “He’s probably stronger than you. He can suppress you just by relying on his bloodline.”
 Han Tuo did not agree. “That’s a good thing if that’s the case.”
 The other three Great Dao Divine Spirits approached and asked curiously who Han Tuo’s younger brother was.
