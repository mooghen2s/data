 He was at least a Great Dao existence!
 In the darkness, a huge object was surging. It was terrifyingly huge, as if it could devour everything.
 Han Jue used the simulation trial again.
 [Chaotic Deity: Great Dao Divine Spirit, guardian of the Chaotic Order]
 It was indeed a Great Dao Divine Spirit!
 At this moment.
 Li Zizai suddenly fled and vanished.
 The extremely dangerous aura vanished. It was probably chasing after Li Zizai.
 Han Jue’s gaze landed on the Great Dao of Extreme Origin again. Ever since he arrived, the light and darkness of the Great Dao of Extreme Origin had changed, as if it was responding to him.
 Should he rush in?
 Han Jue could feel that the Great Dao of Extreme Origin would not reject him. Now that there were no other living beings nearby, this was the best opportunity. Even if it didn’t work, he could still leave.
 With that thought, Han Jue controlled Hidden Sect Island and rushed into the Great Dao of Extreme Origin.
 Almost instantly, the Great Dao of Extreme Origin shrank and the entire space fell into darkness.
 Inside the Great Dao of Extreme Origin, Hidden Sect Island was bathed in a strong light.
 (Detected the existence of the Great Dao of Extreme Origin]
 A line of words appeared in front of Han Jue. He immediately tried to absorb the Great Dao of Extreme Origin. The Great Dao of Extreme Origin was too huge. Han Jue couldn’t absorb it directly. It seemed that he could only fuse it here.
 Han Jue began to fuse with the Great Dao of Extreme Origin with a nervous mind.
 After a while, the Great Dao of Extreme Origin emitted a light. Just like before, it illuminated the dark space.
 For the next period of time, Li Zizai and the Chaotic Deity did not return.
 The peace lasted for 860 years.
 Han Jue suddenly sensed something and opened his eyes. A figure appeared outside the Great Dao of Extreme Origin. This person’s body was gathered with a black aura, and he wore a pure white mask. There was only one vertical eye on the mask, and his pupil spun around.
 Seeing this person, Han Jue’s heart almost jumped to his throat. He immediately used the simulation trial to test the other party.
 (Great Dao Concealment Fiendcelestial: Transcendent Dao Expert, Chaotic Fiendcelestial]
 Great Dao Concealment Fiendcelestial?
 Han Jue frowned. There was a Great Dao Concealment Fiendcelestial among the Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols he had cultivated so far.
 Why was this happening?
 Could it be that all three thousand Fiendcelestials might exist somewhere?
 Han Jue was terrified. Who created this Grand Unity Aspect?
 If it was the system, how did it create it?
 The Great Dao Concealment Fiendcelestial didn’t seem to see him. It observed for a while before leaving
 Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief and continued to fuse with the Great Dao of Extreme Origin.
 “Can the Great Dao of Extreme Origin block the prying from outside?” Han Jue asked in his mind.
 (100 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [Yes]
 I see!
 Relieved, Han Jue focused on fusing with the Great Dao of Extreme Origin.
 Five hundred years later. Li Zizai returned again. His aura had weakened greatly. He was probably being hunted down by the Chaotic Deity.
 Even so, this fellow still dared to return. He really did not give up.
 Li Zizai stayed for a few months before leaving again.
 Han Jue began to enter seclusion fully. Anyway, he was in the second arena and was not afraid of attacks.
 …
 Earth Immortal World, Reincarnation Space.
 In a dazzling hall, Yang Du and the nine Reincarnators stood side by side. In front of them stood a figure in a golden robe and a golden crown.
 Yang Du asked, “Overgod, why are you looking for us?”
 The ten Reincarnators were shocked and looked at each other.
 This was the first time they received such a mission.
 “Are the other party’s Reincarnators very strong?”
 “Not bad. The recent missions are really not difficult.”
 “Isn’t the Reincarnation Space the only one?”
 “Hmph, in that case, let’s put down our grudges first.”
 Yang Du thought of Han Jue. Could Han Jue be the mastermind of the other spaces?
 No.
 I can’t think like that.
 Before that lord instructed him, he had to do his best to show his talent in the Reincarnation Space.
 That lord had chosen him because he definitely hoped that he would obtain an extremely high status and authority in the Reincarnation Space.
 The Golden-Robed Master said, “It’s not only you. The other Overgods will also choose ten Reincarnators, totaling 120. I hope that one of you can obtain first place. At that time, I will reward you heavily.” The Reincarnators agreed in unison, all filled with confidence.
 In the 33rd Heaven, the Sages gathered in the Universal Hall.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du asked, “Why hasn’t Fellow Daoist Han Jue done anything recently?”
 Not long ago, he dreamed of Han Jue but couldn’t capture him. He failed.
 Qiu Xilai asked, “Senior, what do you mean?”
 The other Sages also looked at Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du. He couldn’t have gathered them just to ask about Han Jue, right?
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “The Dark Sage King has sent me a letter of challenge. He said that he will definitely devour the Heavenly Dao in ten billion years. He has already begun to bewitch the living beings of the Immortal World and is preparing to launch a calamity first. He’s so blatant. What do you think he’s doing?”
 The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate snorted. “Also, he already knows that we are going to choose a new Sage and wants to sow discord.”
 Sect Master Tian Jue nodded.
 Emperor Xiao said, “I think so, too. The Dark Sage King might be anxious.”
 “As long as I wait in the Heavenly Dao, he will be helpless.”
 “The Reincarnation Mystic Realm is indeed controlled by the Dark Sage King. We should be careful.”
 “The Heavenly Dao is controlled by us. Why should we be afraid of him?”
 The Sages discussed.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du’s eyes were faint as he said, “Recently, the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End has stirred up another battle to conquer the Dao Devils. This time, the one who lost was Senior Seven Dao Sage. I suspect that the Dark Sage King might be related to the Dao Devils.”
 The Sages’ expressions changed drastically.
 They all had their own backing in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End.
 The Seven Dao Sage was the strongest existence in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End. If he lost, how could their backing be fine?
 “Everyone, the Dark Sage King is attacking. We have to be wary. We plan to join forces to leave the Heavenly Dao and fight with him first. We will figure out his strength before making plans,” Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said in a low voice. His voice was firm and irrefutable.
 For some reason, the Sages thought of Li Muyi and Qiu Xilai’s schemes. Could Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du also be plotting something like that?
 The longer he lived, the more afraid he was of death. This was the most suitable for a Heavenly Dao Sage.
 Thinking of this, the Sages were vigilant.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du saw through their thoughts and said, “You don’t trust Li Muyi, but you don’t trust me? If I want to scheme against you, I don’t have to beat around the bush. Don’t forget, I’m not a true Heavenly Dao Sage. I’ve long attained the Great Dao. I’ve only returned to control the Human School for the time being and help increase the Heavenly Dao’s providence.”
 Fuxitian smiled and said, “That makes sense. Fellow Daoist Xuan Du won’t do that. Let’s think about how to deal with the Dark Sage King. I heard that after the Dark Sage King devoured the Little Heavenly Dao’s providence, he could already hurt our Heavenly Dao Dao Fruit.”


 Han Jue’s OCD made him wake up on time after a thousand years, which meant that another thousand years had passed. He was immersed in the Great Dao of Extreme Origin and could not extricate himself.
 It was a power that far exceeded the Heavenly Dao Sage Realm!
 He was not restricted by any rules. Even the Heavenly Dao and Great Dao could not restrain him. This was the Freedom Sage Realm!
 Han Jue had already grasped the basics and stepped into the process of fusing with the Great Dao of Extreme Origin.
 This process might take a long time. After all, it was not a minor realm.
 Han Jue teleported from the second Dao Field to the Hundred Peak Immortal River. He walked around the Fusang Tree and observed his disciples.
 Half a day later, he returned to the second Dao Field and continued his Dao Integration.
 He did this to prevent the disciples from thinking that he had already left and give the other Sages a chance to fan the flames.
 The Dao Field could block Sages, but it couldn’t block their dreams.
 Han Jue quickly immersed himself in the Dao Integration and forgot everything.
 In the darkness, countless meteors surrounded each other. In the center was a stone island. A black pillar of light with an unknown height on the island connected to the darkness.
 In front of the black pillar of light, Li Zizai knelt on the ground.
 Upon a careful look, a burly figure sitting could be seen seated on a stone chair in the pillar of light. The outline of the figure emitted a great pressure that was terrifying.
 Kneeling in front of this figure, Li Zizai did not even dare to look up. “This Great Dao is mysterious. Stop staring at it. Many old fellows watching in the depths of the Chaos. You don’t have a chance.”
 A hoarse voice sounded.
 Li Zizai frowned and said in a low voice, “I understand.”
 The hoarse voice added, “There’s chaos in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End. The Dao Devils are wreaking havoc. Go back and investigate. I suspect there’s a conspiracy behind it.
 Li Zizai looked up. “What do you think of the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End?”
 “The Deity Realm of the Ruins of End cannot be destroyed.”
 “The Heavenly Dao World has been shrinking. Once the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End is destroyed, the Heavenly Dao will sooner or later be devoured by the Chaotic Faction. Everything Pangu has done will be in vain. The former Chaotic Darkness will return and we will all perish.”
 “Who is in the Chaotic Faction? I only know the Chaotic Deity.” “You will understand when you transcend the illusion.”
 In the black light, the burly figure slowly stood up.
 Li Zizai looked up.
 The ghost mist figure said, “Find the Primordial Fiendcelestial. The Chaotic forces are looking for him. We have to find him first.”
 With that, the black pillar of light shrank and vanished.
 Li Zizai turned around and left.
 Time passed.
 Year after year passed.
 Ten thousand years passed in the blink of an eye. When Han Jue reached 110,000 years old, he didn’t encounter any system choices. It would probably only be triggered once every 100,000 years. Thinking back, a long time ago, he had triggered the system choice once at the age of ten.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and heaved a sigh of relief.
 His body was still filled with divine light, but it was no longer the light of the Sun and Moon Yin-Yang Protection, but the light of the Great Dao.
 The fusion process was already halfway through. There was nothing unusual on the surface of the Great Dao of Extreme Origin, but in fact, it was almost replaced by Han Jue.
 Han Jue took the time to check his emails.
 (Your good friend Li Daokong was attacked by the Heavenly Dao and was severely injured.]
 (Your good friend Yang Du was attacked by a mysterious race] X7629201
 (Your son Han Tuo was attacked by a Deity Realm cultivator of the Buddhist Sect.]
 (Your good friend Evil Heavenly Emperor was attacked by a mysterious Dao Devil and was severely injured.]
 (Your good friend Immortal Emperor Samsara was cursed by a mysterious curse.]
 (Your grand-disciple Fang Liang has obtained
 cultivation has increased greatly.]
 (Your good friend Qiu Xilai was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure and was severely injured. His Dao heart was damaged.]
 (Your good friend Emperor Xiao…)
 Why was Li Daokong attacked by the Heavenly Dao?
 Could it be that the Heavenly Dao Spirit had already possessed the living beings of the Immortal World?
 The number of times Yang Du was attacked was really exaggerated. After the dream ended back then, Yang Du developed a favorable impression of him. As time passed, his favorability kept increasing. Now, it had already increased to 5.5 stars.
 It was probably related to his experience.
 Han Jue noticed that the Sages were attacked by a mysterious mighty figure. Looking down, all the Sages were attacked by a mysterious mighty figure and were severely injured. Could it be that they were all attacked by the same enemy? Dark Sage King!
 Han Jue could only think of this person.
 In short, his friends were doing well. No one had died.
 After the calamity ended, other than the million disciples of the Hundred Peak Immortal River, all the living beings in the myriad worlds had never seen him. Therefore, Han Jue’s circle of friends was still very strong. All of them were experts who dominated an area, and it was very difficult for them to die.
 Han Jue thought for a moment and sent a dream to Immortal Emperor Samsara.
 The dream began.
 Immortal Emperor Samsara was quite excited when he saw Han Jue. He immediately knelt down and bowed.
 “Master, you’re finally looking for me!”
 “Have you encountered trouble recently?”
 targeted by the Infinite Space. The Infinite Space also has the backing of a Sage. The Sage of the Human School told us to avoid him and not fight with him. However, the Infinite Space has always been targeting us.”
 Han Jue raised his eyebrows.
 Infinite Space… The Reincarnation Space’s form was imitated by some mighty figures in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End, so they were not surprised.
 However, the Infinite Space was blocking his way. He had to think of a way to resolve this issue.
 Han Jue asked, “Who is the Sage behind the Infinite Space?”
 Immortal Emperor Samsara said helplessly, “I don’t know.”
 He was a high and mighty existence in the Reincarnation Space, but in front of a Sage, he was only a pawn.
 The pawns couldn’t see the situation outside the chessboard.
 Han Jue said, “What about the Reincarnation Space’s interior? How’s the development?”
 “More than a million Reincarnators have already reached the Immortal Realm. It’s not bad. Earth is worthy of being the inheritance of the Earth Immortal World. We chose many outstanding Reincarnators from the River of Time. Some Reincarnators were born with the providence of the Human Emperor. After stepping into cultivation, they were unstoppable. For example, Di Xin, Ying Zheng, Han Wudi, Li Shimin, Zhao Kuangyin, and so on.”
 Immortal Emperor Samsara began to talk about the development of the Reincarnation Space.
 Han Jue wasn’t surprised that the Emperor of Han and the other Emperors had the providence of the Human Emperor or.
 The providence of the Human Emperor was not worth much. Even Xing Hongxuan had it.
 After all, it was only the providence of a race, let alone the fact that the humans were no longer part of the Heavenly Dao Race.
 From Immortal Emperor Samsara, Han Jue learned that Yang Du was already one of the top existences in the Reincarnation Space. He was the most favored Reincarnator among the twelve Overgods under Immortal Emperor Samsara.
 The reason why he was not the first was that the Human School had also nurtured a powerful Reincarnator. They had fought with Yang Du many times and both sides had wins and losses. In short, they were on par.
 Han Jue suddenly asked, “When does the Reincarnation Space control the Earth Immortal World?”
 Immortal Emperor Samsara said, “There are no longer any races in the Earth Immortal World that can threaten us. It’s just that the Sage of the Human School wants us to slow down. He’s afraid of alerting the mysterious Chaotic Fiendcelestial behind the science and even more afraid of alerting the Ancestor of the Earth Immortal World, Zhen Yuanzi.”


 Currently, Han Jue was busy attaining the Dao of Freedom Sage. Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du was also severely injured by a mysterious mighty figure and had no time to fight against the Earth Immortal World’s Chaotic Fiendcelestial.
 Han Jue asked Immortal Emperor Samsara to listen to the Sage of the Human School first. He was to pay more attention to the Reincarnators and see who had the best potential.
 He planned to choose the next Chaotic Fiendcelestial from the Earth Immortal World. Among the Heavenly Dao Sages, only Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du was paying attention to the Earth Immortal World. However, because it was far away, he wouldn’t pay too much attention.
 The number of Chaotic Fiendcelestials successors was limited. It was impossible for Han Jue to let all three thousand Chaotic Fiendcelestials be possessed by living beings. A portion of them had to be derived from themselves.
 After chatting for a few hours, Han Jue ended the dream and continued to fuse with the Great Dao of Extreme Origin.
 Immortal World, Reincarnation Mystic Realm.
 Han Tuo and Yi Tian were walking side by side. The two of them had relaxed expressions and were chatting and laughing.
 They were already Deity Realm experts now, and Yi Tian was extremely close to the Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm.
 A mysterious expert lived in the Reincarnation Mystic Realm. Back then, Han Tuo almost died here.
 Calamity’s Vengeful had a solemn expression as he said, “Something’s wrong here. Be careful.”
 Yi Tian still respected Calamity’s Vengeful. After all, this was a Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal and had the memories of the countless ghosts of the previous calamity. He always introduced the history and broadened their horizons.
 Han Tuo said, “We’re no longer the same as before. Nothing should happen.”
 The three of them continued forward.
 According to his memories, Han Tuo came to the place he visited a long time ago and called the master of the Reincarnation Mystic Realm.
 Soon, the mystic realm master’s voice sounded. “It’s you again.”
 After tens of thousands of years, the other party still remembered him. Han Tuo frowned slightly.
 At that time, the master of the mystic realm had taught him a lesson.
 “Wait, something’s wrong with him!” Calamity’s Vengeful suddenly shouted with a horrified tone.
 Yi Tian asked in surprise, “What’s wrong?”
 “His aura isn’t that of a Heavenly Dao lifeform!” Calamity’s Vengeful said in a low voice, his voice trembling.
 The Master of the Mystic Realm chuckled. “Is it formed by resentment? Interesting. Since you’ve seen through my identity, don’t leave.” A black crack suddenly appeared and quickly expanded. A huge cold eye appeared and stared at Han Tuo and the other two. Yi Tian immediately took out a golden staff and prepared to fight.
 In the depths of the chaos, the Great Dao of Extreme Origin. Han Jue opened his eyes again. Five thousand years had passed.
 He was getting closer and closer to success.
 Han Jue suddenly discovered that another figure was staring at the Great Dao of Extreme Origin quietly.
 He hurriedly used the simulation trial.
 [Nüwa: Great Dao Sage, Immeasurable Emperor, Creator of the Human Race)
 Why was she here?
 Nüwa was wrapped in a strong light, so Han Jue didn’t recognize her.
 Even if they were good friends, Han Jue had no intention of going out to acknowledge her. He had always been vigilant against Nüwa. Han Jue entered the simulation trial and fought with her.
 In the end, he was killed by Nüwa.
 He only lasted five minutes.
 A Great Dao Sage was indeed powerful.
 Han Jue found it strange.
 Why could Nüwa jump from a Heavenly Dao Sage to a Great Dao Sage?
 She didn’t need to transcend the Freedom Sage?
 Could it be that Nüwa had long been a Freedom Sage, but she had reduced her cultivation level to a Heavenly Dao Sage halfway through like Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du and Heavenly Venerate Wufa?
 Han Jue was puzzled. He didn’t derive it. Anyway, he just treated Nüwa as a Great Dao Sage.
 After a long while…
 Just as Han Jue was about to continue his Dao Integration, another figure appeared. It was on the other side of the Great Dao of Extreme Origin and kept a distance from Nüwa.
 “I didn’t expect Nüwa to also have your eyes on this Great Dao. Are we fated?”
 A mocking laugh sounded. The two mighty figures did not sense that there was already someone inside the Great Dao of Extreme Origin.
 Nüwa said calmly, “I have no affinity with this Great Dao. I just suspect that the birth of this Great Dao is related to the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity.”
 “Hehe, Empress is still so kind and worried about the chaos.”
 “What about you, Daoist Destiny? Your supporter, Sage Fated Secrets, has already perished. You don’t care about him at all, but you’re here to care about the new Great Dao?”
 “So be it if your unfilial disciple is dead, but this Great Dao is fated with me. I advise you to forget it. Don’t fight with me, or I’ll be forced to not give the Dao Ancestor’s personal disciple face.”
 Nüwa did not reply. The depths of the chaos fell silent again.
 Han Jue was shocked. Sage Fated Secrets actually had such a background?
 He immediately used the system to check.
 (Daoist Destiny: Great Dao Divine Spirit, Chaotic Fiendcelestial]
 There were only two labels, but they looked terrifying
 It was even a Chaotic Fiendcelestial!
 as even
 Could it be formed by the Great Dao of Destiny?
 Han Jue thought silently.
 Nüwa and Daoist Destiny stopped talking. After a long time, they left.
 Han Jue continued his Dao Integration.
 It had to be said that the depths of the chaos truly broadened his horizons. Although there was nothing here, it was a place where the strongest ruled.
 He wanted to fuse with the Dao as soon as possible and leave this high-level map as soon as possible.
 It was better to stay in the Heavenly Dao Immortal World.
 Outside the 33rd Heaven, in the Universal Hall, the Sages gathered. Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du, South Extreme Heavenly Venerate, Heavenly Venerate Wufa, Qiu Xilai, Sect Master Tian Jue, Fuxitian, and Emperor Xiao had dark expressions. Empress Houtu sized up their expressions and understood.
 Empress Houtu said, “Since we can’t defeat the Dark Sage King, we can guard the Immortal World in peace. Not long ago, the Dark Sage King used the Reincarnation Mystic Realm to capture the living beings of the Immortal World. The Son of the Heavenly Dao and Han Jue’s son were also captured.”
 Hearing this, the South Extreme Heavenly Venerate’s eyes lit up. “Han Jue’s son has been captured. He should be taking action, right?”
 Qiu Xilai shook his head. “Not necessarily. Han Jue doesn’t care about his son at all. Otherwise, he would have long been taken into the Hundred Peak Immortal River.”
 “If Han Jue cared, he would have already sensed it. He didn’t show up, which means that he’s more afraid of the Dark Sage King than concerned about his son.”
 “Sigh, how can the damned Dark Sage King be so powerful?”
 “I contacted the teacher at the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End. He said that he can’t find the time to kill the Dark Sage King. The Deity Realm of the Ruins of End is also facing great trouble.”
 “It seems that there’s a huge faction behind the Dark Sage King. They are also attacking the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End and the Immortal World.”
 “That must be the case. However, I don’t know what faction they are from. Our level is not high enough. Take care of the Immortal World.”


 His cultivation level had also reached the limit, and he could already sense the barrier of the Freedom Realm. As long as he broke through, he would be a Freedom Sage! Han Jue naturally wouldn’t stop. He wanted to break through in one go!
 In the depths of the chaos, the Great Dao of Extreme Origin that illuminated the darkness suddenly shrank. The darkness devoured the light and everything fell into absolute darkness.
 The entire Great Dao of Extreme Origin had already entered Han Jue’s body.
 He first controlled Hidden Sect Island to move away from this place. He used the power of the Traversal Fiendcelestial and quickly jumped out of the depths of the chaos.
 After that, he began to break through.
 Less than twenty breaths of time after the Great Dao of Extreme Origin vanished, figures appeared where it had originally been.
 “What’s going on? Why did this Great Dao suddenly disappear?” “I can’t deduce it.”
 “Who did it?”
 “That shouldn’t be. This Great Dao is unprecedented. We couldn’t bring it away before. Could it be that an even stronger existence has appeared?”
 “It’s said that the Dharma Idol of the Dao Ancestor has appeared in the Immortal World. Could it be the Dao Ancestor?”
 “If so, that’ll be troublesome.”
 These mysterious mighty figures discussed with solemn expressions.
 Han Jue was isolated by the system Dao Field and was naturally not afraid of them calculating unless they surpassed the Dao Creator Realm.
 Several hundred years later.
 Han Jue finally stepped into the Freedom Sage Realm by fusing with the Great Dao of Extreme Origin. His entire being sublimated. His Dharmic powers and soul also transformed.
 Unconsciously, he saw a long bridge formed by seven-colored light. The two ends were distant and endless.
 On the seven-colored bridge stood figures. They were all people who cultivated the Great Dao of Extreme Origin. They faced the same direction like the sword cultivators on the Sword Dao River.
 Not only that, but Han Jue also saw the entire chaos and his previous and current lives. The magnitude of his vision was extremely subtle and indescribable.
 After a long time.
 Han Jue finally woke up from his breakthrough state.
 He slowly opened his eyes, and three lines of words appeared in front of him.
 [Detected that you have achieved the Freedom Realm. You have the following choices:]
 Han Jue raised his eyebrows.
 What was the Creation Spirit Stone?
 He thought for a moment and still chose the second option. After experiencing the depths of Chaos, he felt that a Freedom Sage was not considered powerful. At the beginning of Chaos, even more powerful existences were hidden.
 (Creation Spirit Stone: You can transform anything into a living being within a certain period of time. The living being created will listen to you. You can control their life and death through the Creation Spirit Stone.]
 Eh?
 Seeing the description, Han Jue immediately thought of the Fiendcelestial Qi.
 He was just worried that he couldn’t give birth to a Chaotic Fiendcelestial when the system sent him the Creation Spirit Stone.
 He would try it when he returned. If it worked, the Creation Spirit Stone would be his greatest asset in the future.
 Han Jue checked his attributes panel.
 [Name: Han Jue]
 [Race: Primordial Fiendcelestial (Immeasurable Emperor)]
 (Cultivation: Early-stage of the Freedom Primordial Chaos Realm (Perfect Sage)]
 (Technique: Primordial Chaos Reincarnation Great Dao (Great Dao), Heavenly Cycle Body Tempering] (Great Dao: Great Dao of Life and Death, Great Dao of Karma, Great Dao of Extreme Origin]
 His lifespan had increased by a hundred times. How satisfying!
 Han Jue was in a good mood.
 He immediately sent a dream to Immortal Emperor Samsara and asked him to use the Invocation Technique.
 Although Immortal Emperor Samsara was puzzled, he still did it dutifully.
 Han Jue jumped out of Hidden Sect Island and put it into his sleeve. He then turned around and entered the black vortex that had appeared behind him.
 The spatial node of the Invocation Technique would follow Han Jue until the user canceled his Mystical Power.
 Passing through the black vortex, Han Jue came to Immortal Emperor Samsara’s hall.
 He turned around and saw that the black vortex was still there.
 Han Jue looked at Immortal Emperor Samsara and said, “Cancel the Invocation Technique.”
 Immortal Emperor Samsara immediately followed.
 The black vortex shrank. Just as it was about to disappear, an extremely terrifying aura came.
 Han Jue’s expression changed.
 This aura…
 Chaotic Deity! Great Dao Divine Spirit!
 Fortunately, the black vortex closed in time and the terrifying aura vanished.
 Shocked, Immortal Emperor Samsara asked fearfully, “The aura just now was…”
 He had never felt such a terrifying aura. Even if he went to the Sage Dao Field to listen to the Dao, the vast aura of the preaching Sage was far from this.
 At that moment, Immortal Emperor Samsara felt that he was already dead. Han Jue said, “Nothing. Don’t think about it. Otherwise, the other party will remember you.” The senses of the Great Dao Divine Spirit were extremely terrifying. He could probably sense if anyone was thinking of him.
 Immortal Emperor Samsara took a deep breath and nodded slowly.
 Han Jue felt that the Little Heavenly Dao of the Earth Immortal World was rejecting him, but this repulsive force was very weak.
 If he stayed any longer, the Earth Immortal World would directly shatter. Han Jue disappeared after saying, “It’s fine. Continue cultivating.”
 Han Jue directly jumped into the depths of the sun and hid Hidden Sect Island inside. He then jumped into the island.
 Han Jue decided to put the new guard in the second arena. He began to duplicate Li Muyi.
 After Heavenly Venerate Wufa was enslaved, he returned to the Freedom Primordial Chaos Realm, which was not within the realm of the Heavenly Dao Sage.
 The duplication began.
 Han Jue teleported back to the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 He sat on the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus and heaved a sigh of relief.
 Finally.
 It was too dangerous!
 He didn’t want to experience such a risk again.
 (The Chaotic Deity has developed hatred towards you. Current Hatred Points: 1 star.]
 Bastard!
 Come and kill me if you have the guts!
 Han Jue cursed in his mind when he saw the notification.
 The other party had developed hatred towards him for no reason. Very good. The Book of Misfortune had already accumulated dust. It should be used again.
 Han Jue adjusted his state of mind and checked his emails.
 It had been a long time since he checked them.
 Email after email appeared in front of Han Jue. Then, he suddenly frowned.
 (Your son Han Tuo was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure and was severely injured.)
 (Your son Han Tuo was ravaged by the power of darkness. His soul was damaged.]
 (Your son Han Tuo was preached by a mysterious mighty figure. His Dao heart has been damaged.]
 He looked up and discovered that Han Tuo was not in the Immortal World.
 Counting with his fingers, his expression changed slightly.
 He actually could not deduce where Han Tuo was.
 “I want to know where Han Tuo is.” Han Jue immediately used the derivation function.
 (Ten billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 Han Jue wanted to see who took his son away.
 Immediately after, he entered an illusion.
 He opened his eyes to discover that he had arrived in a huge cage. Dozens of living beings were imprisoned in it. The largest was like a mountain leaning against the wall. Han Tuo and Yi Tian sat in a corner, looking dispirited.


 A line of words appeared in front of him.
 (Dark Falling Prison: A prison located in the Dark Forbidden Zone. It was created by the Dark Sage King. It is said that even Sages will not be able to escape death if they enter this prison.]
 How pretentious!
 Han Jue secretly felt disdain.
 At this moment, a majestic voice sounded outside the prison.
 “Prepare yourselves. The Sage King is about to preach the Dao. All of you vile beasts must not be negligent!”
 Black tentacles suddenly emerged from the ground of the prison and wrapped around all the living beings inside. Han Tuo’s back was pierced by the black tentacles. He looked pained. Yi Tian cursed. “What nonsense are you spouting! Aren’t you just trying to enslave us? Kill me if you have the guts! Don’t give me a chance. If I escape in the future, your bodies and souls will be destroyed!”
 Boom
 A black lightning bolt struck down, shattering Yi Tian into pieces. Blood splattered all over the ground.
 Immediately after, another light descended and recovered his body.
 The other living beings were not shocked. They were numb to this already.
 They had all experienced this pain. They died and revived endlessly.
 The illusion shattered.
 Han Jue continued to ask, “If I attack with my fastest speed, can I insta-kill the Dark Sage King?”
 (Ten billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 (There’s hope]
 The system did not say yes, but it at least meant that Han Jue could insta-kill the Dark Sage King in a normal situation.
 “Is there anyone stronger than me behind the Dark Sage King?” [Ten billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [Yes]
 Han Jue remained silent. He wasn’t surprised. One had to know that the Heavenly Dao Sages all had powerful backgrounds. Under such circumstances, for the Dark Sage King to dare to bite the Heavenly Dao, he was definitely fearless.
 When the Sages fought, there were even more extraordinary existences behind them.
 Han Jue thought for a moment and asked again, “Why did the Dark Sage King capture these Heavenly Dao lifeforms?”
 (Ten billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 Han Jue entered another illusion.
 He opened his eyes and came to a mysterious hall.
 The Dark Sage King stood in front of three majestic stone statues. He did not bend down. His back was straight.
 “The Deity Realm of the Ruins of End has already begun to descend into chaos. What are you going to do next?”
 A mysterious voice sounded with an indifferent tone.
 The Dark Sage King replied, “Capture the person with the greatest providence in the Heavenly Dao and turn him into my servant. When we attack the Heavenly Dao in the future, let these servants be the vanguard and tear apart the Heavenly Dao rules.”
 “How confident are you?”
 “Absolute!”
 “Alright, the chaos in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End this time has used the great Dharmic powers of an ancient existence. Don’t mess it up.” “Understood.”
 The illusion ended. It was very short, but the information revealed was tremendous The existence behind the Dark Sage King was actually still plotting against the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End.
 “I want to know what force is behind the Dark Sage King. Who led it?” Han Jue thought silently.
 (This karma involves an existence that surpasses the system’s limits. It cannot be deduced.]
 So powerful?
 Han Jue began to think about how to save Han Tuo.
 If it was in the Immortal World, he could let him go. Now that Han Tuo had been captured by the Dark Sage King, if he did not attack, his son would most likely be gone.
 He could only teach Han Tuo the Invocation Technique. Han Jue used the Invocation Dao to summon Han Tuo.
 Although his identity would be exposed, Han Jue couldn’t care less.
 After thinking, he immediately sent a dream to Han Tuo.
 Then, he frowned.
 Eh?
 He couldn’t send a dream!
 Han Jue used the Dark Nightmare, but there was no reaction.
 It seemed that the Dark Falling Prison was not simple.
 Wait.
 Han Jue suddenly thought of the Reincarnation Mystic Realm.
 The Dark Sage King captured him through the Reincarnation Mystic Realm.
 Han Jue could send someone to infiltrate the Reincarnation Mystic Realm and be caught like Han Tuo.
 After thinking for a moment, he sent Liu Bei over.
 Liu Bei was his Reincarnation Avatar and later possessed the body of the Buddhist Sect’s Victorious Fighting Buddha. After so many years, his cultivation level had already increased to the Five Mystic Divine Origin.
 His potential was still a little lacking. When Han Jue created the Reincarnation Avatar, his potential was also not good, so Liu Bei’s improvement was very slow.
 However, as a pawn, it was definitely enough.
 Liu Bei entered the Daoist temple and knelt down.
 “I’m sending you to the Reincarnation Mystic Realm…”
 Han Jue told him what had happened. Although Liu Bei was nervous, he still braced himself and agreed.
 “You have grasped the Invocation Technique. If you encounter danger, you can summon me. Since you already understand the mission, I will seal this memory before you leave. You only need to remember that once you are in the Reincarnation Mystic Realm, if you encounter the Dark Sage King, you must summon me.”
 “I understand.”
 “Go.”
 Han Jue waved his sleeve and sent him out.
 Although Liu Bei was timid, he was very capable. Back in the netherworld, he had found Hidden Sect Island.
 Still worried, Han Jue then sent a dream to Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du.
 The dream was a sea of clouds, the sky was vast and beautiful.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du opened his eyes and saw that it was Han Jue. His eyes lit up. Han Jue didn’t speak immediately.
 He was gambling that the one who had attacked the Sages was the Dark Sage King. Now, the Sages should be looking forward to him dealing with him.
 The Dark Sage King’s appearance made the Heavenly Dao Sages stand on the same side.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du asked, “You sent me a dream probably because of your son.”
 The Sages actually knew Han Tuo’s identity, but they had not pointed it out in the past.
 They were not stupid. It was impossible for them to think of capturing Han Tuo to threaten Han Jue. It was not realistic, and they would fall out with each other.
 Han Jue asked, “Do you want to deal with the Dark Sage King?”
 “Yes!”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du replied bluntly, “Let’s join forces. The Dark Sage King’s goal is the Heavenly Dao. He can’t kill his way in for the time being, but he has been devouring the Little Heavenly Dao in the chaos. When he truly has the strength to kill his way into the Heavenly Dao, we Sages will not be his match.”
 “If we join forces to deal with the Dark Sage King, will we be plotted against by the existence behind him?”
 “He has a backing, so do we!”
 Han Jue remained silent.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du thought for a moment and continued, “We Sages will contact the masters in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End and let them restrain the existence behind the Dark Sage King. In the past, they might have been worried, but recently, the existence behind the Dark Sage King has gone overboard and has already infuriated the mighty figures in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End. This matter should be settled.”
 He stared at Han Jue and asked, “If no other mighty figures interfere, can we join forces to kill the Dark Sage King?”
 He was very aggrieved. He was originally a Freedom Sage, and dealing with the Dark Sage King was nothing difficult. However, now that he was restricted to the Heavenly Dao Sage position, he wasn’t the Dark Sage King’s match.
 Now, he could only place his hopes on Han Jue.
 This fellow was very strong and had even used his strength to attain the Dao. The Heavenly Dao Sages were not his match. In addition, if they joined forces, they might be able to kill the Dark Sage King.
 Han Jue stared at him and asked, “Can I believe you?”
