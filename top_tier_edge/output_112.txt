 “Master, do you want me to make peace with them now?” Dugu Wu looked up at him and asked in a low voice.
 Dugu Wu sighed. “It’s definitely a lie to say that I don’t regret it at all. However, I’m really indignant to let go of my hatred like this. I believe they won’t let it go.”
 Han Jue smiled. “What do you think of the Ultimate Origin World?”
 !!
 Dugu Wu replied, “I hate those high and mighty Fiendcelestials. I was born in the Ultimate Origin World, so I naturally don’t hate it. As my cultivation level increased, I also learned that my potential was a gift from the world.”
 “Do you know of the existence of the other Great Dao Worlds?”
 This was the truth.
 Currently, in the entire Endless Era, the Great Dao World that was the most attractive to living beings was the Ultimate Origin World. It was created by the Lord. The Spirit Qi far exceeded the other Great Dao Worlds. Just the nine Supreme Rules were enough to make mighty figures go mad.
 The Ultimate Origin World was very strong and could suppress outsiders.
 Han Jue smiled and said, “Your potential
 should be used to protect the Ultimate Origin
 World, not to fight among yourselves. What
 you think?”
 do
 Dugu Wu asked helplessly, “Tell me, what should I do?”
 Han Jue smiled and said, “I can erase the memories of all living beings and let you start over.”
 Dugu Wu widened his eyes.
 It was not difficult to erase memories, but to erase the memories of all living beings…
 This included his enemies whom he had
 difficulty dealing with!
 Dugu Wu asked nervously, “Is this too troublesome?”
 “Troublesome? It’d just take a thought from
 me.”
 “Erm…”
 Even Dugu Wu, who had experienced many
 storms, was shocked.
 What kind of ability was this?
 Han Jue saw through his thoughts and
 clapped his hands gently. He smiled and said, “Alright, from now on, all living beings have forgotten about you.”
 It was very simple to make them forget about Dugu Wu. Just erase his karma with all living beings. Not to mention the Creator Lord, even a Dao Creator could do it, and the range that the Creator Lord could cover included the Dao
 Creators.
 Dugu Wu trembled. He didn’t feel anything. If not for the fact that the other party was the Grandfather Deity he had acknowledged, he would have thought that the other party was playing with him.
 Han Jue raised his hand and waved. Han You appeared beside him.
 Dugu Wu immediately became nervous and waited solemnly.
 Han You was still meditating and cultivating. Sensing that something was wrong, he opened his eyes. The moment he saw Han Jue,
 he immediately knelt down in fear and
 trepidation.
 This was the first time Dugu Wu had seen
 Han You like this. The leader of the Nether Race was one of the most powerful existences in the Ultimate Origin World. He had always looked down on him previously.
 Han Jue said, “Do you know this child?”
 Han You turned to look at Dugu Wu and shook his head. “No.”
 Then, the Life Fiendcelestial appeared beside
 Han Jue.
 Dugu Wu’s expression became strange.
 Han Jue said, “This child’s talent is unparalleled. He will stay in the Ultimate Origin World in the future. He’s considered
 one of my disciples. You will protect the Ultimate Origin World together.”
 The Life Fiendcelestial sized up Dugu Wu and praised him, “You’re actually stronger than me at such a young age.”
 Dugu Wu coughed. “Please take care of me in
 the future.”
 “Sure, sure!”
 The Life Fiendcelestial laughed. Dugu Wu felt relieved and was even more respectful towards Han Jue.
 Dugu Wu was born alone. He had been targeted ever since he displayed his potential.
 His hatred came from fighting. Because he did not have any family or good friends around him, he did not have any blood feuds. Han Jue smiled and said, “You guys can chat.
 The Endless Era will change again. The Ultimate Origin World needs more geniuses. Don’t let the other Great Dao Worlds catch up to us.”
 He disappeared after saying his piece. Han You and the Life Fiendcelestial did not
 make the atmosphere awkward. Instead, they talked to Dugu Wu warmly.
 Dugu Wu looked at these two faces that he
 It was actually good that they were not
 enemies.
 Dugu Wu was still a little worried, afraid that they were pretending.
 Then, he followed the Life Fiendcelestial and Han You to see the masters of the various factions in the Ultimate Origin World and obtained unprecedented treatment. Han You said that whoever dared to scheme against Dugu Wu would not be able to withstand the consequences.
 Only then did Dugu Wu realize that Han Jue was really terrifying. He clapped his hands
 and changed the memories of all living beings.
 …
 In the third Dao Field.
 After settling the matter of Dugu Wu, Han Jue continued to observe the Endless Era.
 He had his own plans for helping him. As the Lord, how could he not have a new Dao Creator from the living beings from his own Ultimate Origin World?
 Perhaps Dugu Wu couldn’t catch up to Han
 Huang and the Dao Ancestor, but he wouldn’t fall too far behind.
 In the future, the more Dao Creators appeared
 in the Ultimate Origin World, the better. This could restrain the current Dao Creators. Compared to his children, Han Jue believed in his Ultimate Origin World more. All the living beings in the Ultimate Origin World were also his children. Besides, the stronger the Ultimate Origin World was, the stronger he
 was. The stronger he was, the more the Ultimate Origin World benefited. Han Jue closed his eyes and resumed cultivation after watching the Endless Era for a while.
 Only by maintaining a cultivation attitude could he be endless.
 Surpassing the Creator Lord Realm was something he had to do!
 In the netherworld.
 Long Hao and Han Liang were advancing on
 the Bridge of Forgetfulness. “Where are we going?” Han Liang couldn’t
 help but ask. Long Hao pulled him out mysteriously and refused to say anything. Long Hao smiled and said, “To a place filled with opportunities.”
 Han Liang asked, “Where?” What opportunities could there be in the netherworld?
 “Ultimate Origin World!” Long Hao said firmly with a fanatical expression. Han Liang was surprised. He naturally knew
 about the Ultimate Origin World. It was a Great Dao World personally established by the Lord and was called the strongest Great Dao
 World. However, the Ultimate Origin World was extremely xenophobic. Only locals could live there. If they wanted to enter, they had to
 change their karma. “But…”
 “Don’t worry, I have a way to hide our karma. This trip to the Ultimate Origin World won’t last long, we just have to find a treasure. This
 treasure can help you create your Great Dao World. Haven’t you always been unable to succeed? Perhaps you’re just lacking external help. After all, you’re young. If you don’t have opportunities, it’s very difficult to surpass
 your stage.”
 Long Hao waved his hand as if he was thinking for him.
 A figure walked over. Strong light flashed,
 “Ju- Emperor, why are you here?” Long Hao asked.
 He wanted to call her Junior Sister Ling’er, but he felt that it was inappropriate. After all, this was the netherworld, and it was easy to be spied on.


 Han Ling nodded slightly and asked, “Are you going to the Ultimate Origin World?”
 The Ultimate Origin World was in a remote corner of the Endless Era. It was too far away even to Great Dao Supremes. The netherworld was closer.
 “That’s right. You just returned from the Ultimate Origin World?”
 “Yes, go ahead.”
 !!
 Han Ling nodded slightly and brushed past him.
 Han Liang turned around. He was secretly puzzled. What was wrong with Fourth Aunt? Why did it feel like she was distracted?
 Long Hao was also a little puzzled, but he did not ask further. It wasn’t good to ask about other people’s private matters.
 At the same time.
 Han Ling was also puzzled.
 “Strange, why was I in the Ultimate Origin World… Why do I feel that something is
 wrong…’
 ||
 Han Ling felt uneasy. She felt that something had happened, but she couldn’t understand when she thought about it carefully. It was as if she had a dream, but she had forgotten
 about it for some reason.
 There was definitely something fishy!
 Ten million years later.
 Han Jue reached 700 million years of age. The
 reward this time was no different from
 before, so he still chose the second option.
 He opened his eyes and summoned Han Ling, who had been waiting outside the Daoist temple for some time.
 Han Ling entered the temple and bowed respectfully before revealing her troubles.
 So she had forgotten something in confusion.
 There were actually many existences like her, but others did not have a way to have their questions answered. They would forget about it as time passed.
 Han Jue smiled and asked, “What do you think you’ve forgotten? With your cultivation,
 who can affect you?”
 Han Ling frowned and subconsciously said,
 “Dao Creator? But why did a Dao Creator
 interfere with me going to the Ultimate Origin…”
 Before she could finish speaking, her
 expression froze as she looked at her father in
 shock.
 Han Jue smiled, but it gave her endless pressure, startling her so much that she
 lowered her head.
 At this moment, many possibilities appeared
 in her mind.
 Could it be that she had offended her father?
 She understood herself. Without great desire,
 it was impossible for her to go far away. Han Jue asked, “How’s the management of your Great Dao World?”
 Han Ling came back to her senses and replied,
 “I can’t condense the Supreme Rules. It’s just like an ordinary world. Other than expanding, there’s no substantial strengthening.”
 Her tone was bitter.
 The news that Han Huang had created the Supreme Rules deeply agitated her.
 brother.
 She wasn’t the only one. Han Jue’s other children thought the same. At most, they felt that their opportunities were inferior to their other siblings. Only Han Yunjin acknowledged that he was mediocre.
 Han Jue began to preach the Dao and used his Dao voice to bring Han Ling into a strange
 state.
 In an instant, she seemed to see a colorful world. Countless lights coiled around her. Somehow, she felt a very strange power. Countless memories surged into her mind. Then, with a boom, she suddenly woke up. She opened her eyes and saw her father’s face. “That was…” Han Ling asked carefully. Her tone was nervous and filled with anticipation.
 Han Jue winked. “This is a secret between us father and daughter. Don’t tell anyone, understand?”
 Just now, Han Jue had brought her to
 experience the basic rules. It was extremely helpful for her to establish her Great Dao
 Her potential made it impossible!
 In the entire Endless Era, other than Han Jue,
 Not even the Primordial Fiendcelestial!
 Han Ling was excited and hurriedly thanked
 him. Han Jue said meaningfully, “Snatching the
 creation of others to fulfill yourself seems to be the survival of the fittest. It’s the Primordial Rule. But, if you walk too many of
 these paths, you’ll get lost sooner or later. Furthermore, with this path, you’ll only accumulate more and more enemies. Don’t
 ignore it. The previous Ninth Chaos thought he was invincible. Didn’t he still die?” Han Ling was silent.
 Han Jue said, “Go back.”
 Han Ling took a deep breath. Then, she stood up and bowed.
 She said seriously, “Father, you’re right. Even Second Brother can repent. How can I take the wrong path again? I’ll let go of those people I
 refined into Emperor Soldiers and apologize to them.”
 “If you do well, you might be able to shoulder
 more responsibility aside from the Creation Emperor Court.”
 Han Jue chuckled.
 Han Ling nodded. Although she was a little
 curious, she knew that it was not the time yet. Just like that, Han Ling left.
 Han Jue smiled. As for whether she really woke up, only time would tell. Only after Han Ling truly practiced it would
 she know if the path was wrong. She had already encountered a wall with Dugu Wu. All these years, her cultivation had not increased.
 She should understand that this path was
 wrong. Currently, Han Huang and Han Ling had both
 veered to the right path. Han Tuo and Han Qing’er didn’t worry Han Jue much. As for
 Han Yunjin, this youngest son made him relieved as usual.
 Han Jue looked at his Great Dao Providence
 Divine Authority. It was time to be discovered after so many years.
 His Great Dao Providence Divine Authority flowed into a mortal world.
 This was also his thought. He wanted to give
 Han Jue thought silently. The corners of his mouth curled up in anticipation.
 He transformed the Great Dao Providence
 Divine Authority into a system and recalled his experience.
 control. He wasn’t worried that the other party would betray him.
 …
 A hundred years later.
 Han Jue was disappointed. The first owner of the Divine Authority
 System was too arrogant and was killed by a passing mighty figure.
 The Divine Authority System was lost in the
 cycle of reincarnation and fell into another
 mortal world.
 she
 After thousands of years, she fell for the trap of love and lost the Divine Authority System. It seemed that it would take a long time for
 anyone to rely on the Divine Authority System to kill his way out. In Han Jue’s settings, the Divine Authority System needed to be liberated bit by bit. If he
 forcefully gave the System’s master too much power, it was very easy to lose himself.
 If it was too strong, it would also attract the
 covetous eyes of other mighty figures.
 Then, Han Jue closed his eyes and continued cultivating. On the other side. Heavenly Dao, Buzhou Divine Mountain.
 Han Yu and Han Yunjin gathered in the hall. Han Yunjin said with a melancholic expression, “I shouldn’t have told that brat
 Sage. He doesn’t even look at his potential. He’s not even worthy of carrying his brother Han Liang’s shoes.”
 Han Yu faced this extremely senior good
 friend and smiled. “Oh you, don’t easily determine his future. This will only make him
 more stubborn.”


 “Sigh, this kid has been disobedient since he was young. He relied on my doting on his mother to act recklessly. Help me deal with him.”
 Han Yu shook his head. “It’s not easy to deal with. Furthermore, he will definitely guess that it was you if I make a move.”
 Han Yunjin sighed again.
 !!
 Han Yu smiled and said, “Why don’t we send him to the three ancestors? They definitely have a way to discipline him.”
 The three ancestors were naturally Han Tuo, Han Huang, and Han Ling. They were already top mighty figures, the strongest existences below the Dao Creator Realm. They each had their own forces and were stronger than the Heavenly Dao.
 Han Yu shook his head and stopped trying to persuade him.
 He did not want to participate in Han Yunjin’s family matters.
 Han Yunjin quickly stood up to leave.
 Han Yu smiled. At this moment, a figure appeared beside him.
 It was Qin Ling, Han Yu’s grand-disciple.
 This former Heavenly Dao soul, Primordial World Overlord Body, Ancestral Dragon providence, Son of the Immeasurable Calamity, and Son of Heaven and Earth, was also a mighty figure above all living beings now. However, he was still far inferior to Han Huang and the others.
 Qin Ling sat in front of him and said, “The situation isn’t good. Master disappeared into the Chaos and might have died. Heavenly Calamity Emperor has already sent someone to investigate.”
 Qin Ling’s master, Tian Yong, was Han Yu’s disciple and also the son of Heavenly Calamity Emperor. He had once brought the Calamity Race to invade the Heavenly Dao and was subdued by Han Jue with the Primordial Heavenly Prison.
 Tian Yong and Qin Ling were only master and disciple. Qin Ling had always been personally taught by Han Yu.
 Han Yu frowned. “That unfilial disciple died?”
 His expression darkened after he pinched his fingers to deduce.
 Although his relationship with Tian Yong was very thin, they were still master and disciple.
 He stood up and said, “Let’s go to the Chaos together. It’s said that the Dao Heavenly Race is extremely domineering. I want to see how domineering they are.”
 Qin Ling nodded and stood up. His eyes
 flickered coldly.
 He was bored and had a chance to stretch.
 How could he miss it?
 …
 Time passed like a dream. Those who died
 only left traces in history, as if they had never
 existed.
 Fifty million years passed.
 Han Jue opened his eyes. He stretched and
 looked at the blank domain.
 He first paid attention to the Dao Ancestor’s Chaos. The Dao Heavenly Race was already
 gone.
 Although the Dao Heavenly Race was destroyed, it did not mean that they would
 Many mighty figures were teasing the Dao
 Ancestor. They said that he had personally destroyed the race he had created and left
 behind a source of trouble. It was truly unwise.
 Another voice also said that as long as the Dao
 Ancestor became a Dao Creator, the root of the trouble was nothing.
 Han Jue noticed that Han Yu’s disciple, Tian
 Yong, had also died at the hands of the Dao Heavenly Race. Among the forces surrounding the Dao Heavenly Race were the Calamity Race, Han Yu, and Qin Ling.
 Apart from the Dao Ancestor’s abandonment,
 the extinction of the Dao Heavenly Race was also because they were arrogant and had outstanding potential. They looked down on
 the other races, forming a huge amount of hatred over the long years.
 Han Jue didn’t pay special attention to Tian
 Yong and couldn’t be bothered to revive him. The Hidden Sect had countless disciples. It was the same for his descendants. People just died as time passed.
 After purging the Dao Heavenly Race, countless races began to appear in the Chaos. It could be said that hundreds of flowers
 bloomed at once. The rules also became more and more perfected. At this rate, it was only a matter of time before the Dao Ancestor condensed a second Supreme Rule. Apart from the Dao Ancestor, in the other
 Chaos beside him, Pangu also condensed his first Supreme Rule.
 Han Jue checked it and discovered that in the
 entire blank domain, five Great Dao Supremes
 had already condensed at least one Supreme Rule. They were Han Huang, the Dao Ancestor, Pangu, the Primordial Ancestor God, and the Holy Mother of Order. The Holy Mother of Order surprised him.
 She had lived for countless years and was as ancient as the Primordial Ancestor God. She was one of the first living beings created by the Eighth Chaos. Her potential might not be top-notch, but her experience was definitely
 SO.
 This was also a good thing. In any case, the Holy Mother of Order was Han Jue’s servant. Her favorability was maxed out and he was
 not afraid of betrayal.
 At first glance, Han Jue’s power was not dominant. In fact, he still occupied half of the territory. He wanted to manage this atmosphere. Something else was worthy of Han Jue’s
 attention. That was that the future Dao Creator, Heavenly Venerate Xun, who had descended in the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity, had already been born. He had
 Han Jue retracted his gaze and started to check his emails.
 The emails were also exciting, and he read them quietly.
 Han Jue didn’t resume cultivation immediately after reading the emails. Instead, he checked the Divine Authority System. The Divine Authority System already had a
 new master. This person was now a Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal and stood out in a small world in the Dao Mystic Realm.
 It had to be said that it was really fate. Through the cycle of reincarnation, the Divine
 Authority System actually went to the Dao Mystic Realm.
 Perhaps the Divine Authority System’s master
 would bump into Chu Xiaoqi and Chen Jue in the future.
 Han Jue deliberately didn’t look at this Zenith
 Heaven Golden Immortal’s future. That would be boring.
 He closed his eyes and continued cultivating.
 Ultimate Origin World.
 Dugu Wu walked in the void, his body
 wasting his time fighting with the Great Dao Fiendcelestials and the Nether Race, with both sides unable to cultivate in peace. “It’s just ahead. I didn’t expect the Ultimate
 Origin World to have such a place,” Dugu Wu muttered to himself. He saw a majestic figure at the end of the dark void. It was faintly discernible, and its true body was difficult to estimate.
 He approached and saw this mighty figure clearly.
 It was not a living spirit, but a stone statue.
 Its posture was filled with hostility, looking
 like it was roaring at the sky.
 Even the experienced Dugu Wu was shocked. What race was this?
 He raised his right hand and pressed it on the surface of the stone statue. A towering hostility surged towards him and drowned
 him.
 After a long while…
 Dugu Wu suddenly woke up and gasped. He immediately retreated from the stone statue. Just now, he felt that his soul was about to be
 devoured.
 Impossible!
 He was a Great Dao Supreme!
 Could it be that this stone statue was the legendary Dao Creator?
 That’s not right. Why was there a Dao Creator
 in the Ultimate Origin World? Could it be
 related to his master?


 Dugu Wu floated in front of the mysterious stone statue. He didn’t leave or touch it again. He was very afraid.
 The mysterious stone statue did not move. It hid in the darkness and would never die.
 Dugu Wu flew up and arrived in front of the mysterious stone statue’s head. He stared at its face carefully and observed it.
 The more he looked at it, the more he felt that it was similar to his master. This feeling was very strong.
 !!
 If it was related to his master, that stone statue would contain the strongest power in the Ultimate Origin World!
 Dugu Wu’s heart beat faster. Although he acknowledged Han Jue as his master, the two of them were not close and he didn’t obtain the latter’s inheritance.
 He knew Han Jue’s identity. He was the strongest existence at the end of cultivation!
 The more Dugu Wu thought about it, the brighter his eyes became.
 In a world in the Dao Mystic Realm, on the top of a mountain peak that towered into the clouds.
 Chu Xiaoqi sat at the edge of the cliff. Beside him was a youth who also faced the sun as he absorbed the Spirit Qi of Heaven and Earth.
 The youth opened his eyes and scratched his head. “Grandpa, something feels wrong. Why doesn’t this cultivation technique increase Dharmic powers? It only strengthens the body. I don’t want to be a body cultivator!”
 Chu Xiaoqi said without opening his eyes, “You were born with a weak physique. You have to strengthen your physique first before it can withstand your powerful soul and you can soar.”
 “Get lost if you don’t believe me.”
 “Grandpa!”
 The youth grabbed Chu Xiaoqi’s arm and
 shook it with a fawning smile.
 Chu Xiaoqi opened his eyes and smiled.
 “Cultivate well. To be chosen by me, that’s an opportunity that you won’t encounter in your lifetime.”
 He was secretly pleased.
 Was this how his grandfather felt when facing him back then?
 This youth was not his biological grandson.
 He didn’t even have a son. It was just that he did not want to take in a disciple and wanted to take in a grandson, so he acted as his grandfather.
 The youth curled his lips. “Yes, yes.’
 At this moment, a figure appeared behind Chu
 Xiaoqi.
 “Divine Lord, the Ultimate Sect and the Divine Clan are at war!”
 This figure wore black armor, a mask, and a
 helmet. His body was surrounded by a black aura, and he looked extremely sinister and mysterious.
 “I understand. You can leave. Continue paying attention to the situation.”
 “Yes!”
 The black-armored figure vanished as if he
 had never appeared.
 The youth asked curiously, “Grandpa, you seem to be very concerned about the Absolute
 Sect. Are you related to them?”
 Chu Xiaoqi smiled. “One of Grandpa’s younger brothers is in the Absolute Sect. He’s
 the Sect Master. Back then, I protected him as he grew up. Although he’s already on his own, Grandpa still worries about him.”
 “Grandpa’s the best. It’s really my honor to meet you.’
 “Hehe.”
 Although Chu Xiaoqi enjoyed it, he
 inexplicably felt that this kid was being
 sarcastic.
 The grandfather and grandson chatted for a while before continuing to cultivate.
 …
 Fifty million years passed quickly. Han Jue’s
 origin age had reached 800 million years. His cultivation level had been increasing. Recently, another Supreme Rule had been
 born in the Ultimate Origin World, but he specially hid it above the Nine Supreme Rules.
 As time passed, the Supreme Rules of the
 Ultimate Origin World would increase and widen the gap between it and the other Great Dao Worlds.
 How could the development speed of the Creator Lord’s Great Dao World be slower than that of the Dao Creators’ and the Great
 Dao Supremes’ Great Dao Worlds?
 The Ultimate Origin World became stronger and stronger. The cultivators residing there naturally rose in power. More and more Great Dao Supremes and Great Dao Sages appeared. Among them, the number of Freedom Realm experts had already surpassed the number of Freedom Realm experts outside the Ultimate Origin World.
 One day, once those at the Freedom Realm
 erupted, even the number of higher realm
 experts would far exceed those of the Endless Era. Han Jue looked at the Ultimate Origin World.
 The world developed even faster after Dugu Wu reconciled with the mighty figures. Dugu
 Wu represented a prodigy without a racial background. He brought more hope to all living beings. Dugu Wu also spoke up for
 those prodigies without a background and asked the other races, the Great Dao Fiendcelestials, and the Nether Race to help take care of the juniors.
 The current Ultimate Origin World was similar to the stage when the Endless Era had
 just been established. All living beings were busy cultivating.
 Most of the battles were for benefit. The
 Han Jue walked out of the Daoist temple and
 went to visit Xing Hongxuan. Xing Hongxuan had gone out several times in
 the past few years and had a lot to share with him. “I went to the Chaos to take a look. I feel that the Chaos is developing faster than the Primordial Chaos. It seems that the Dao
 “Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du of the Heavenly
 Dao also seems to want to create a Great Dao World. Unfortunately, his cultivation level is too weak. Husband, what do you plan to do with the Heavenly Dao?
 “Ling’er has been given the right to supervise
 the order of the Endless Era. She has soared. Was it your instructions?
 “Hahaha, that brat Chu Xiaoqi has also taken in a grandson. He’s imitating you.” Xing Hongxuan kept talking. Han Jue listened
 most of the time and only occasionally replied. Although he already knew about this, it was interesting to hear it from her.
 Only by reaching the Great Dao Sage Realm
 could one understand a higher realm. This was the inevitable pattern of development. It was worth mentioning that Heavenly Venerate Xun had already appeared. The mighty figures who had experienced the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity back then
 dared
 paid a lot of attention to him, but no one to scheme against him. It was only because he was the Lord’s grandson. It was precisely because of this that no matter where Heavenly Venerate Xun went, mighty figures chased after him, causing him to be even
 more proud and gradually overlap with the future Dao Creator.
 Han Jue had never seen the young Heavenly Venerate Xun. This kid worshiped him and had always wanted to walk his path, but Han Jue was not interested in him. Heavenly Venerate Xun’s limit was that. Han
 Jue could even see how he would die, so he had no expectations for him. In the future, Heavenly Venerate Xun would
 “By the way, Li Yao’s Great Dao World has
 already taken form, but she can’t create the Supreme Rules. You have to help her. She’s your Dao Companions’ representative. The other will see you as incapable if there’s no Dao Creator among your Dao Companions.” Xing Hongxuan suddenly thought of something and smiled teasingly. Han Jue smiled and nodded. “What about you?”
 Han Jue smiled helplessly and didn’t force
 her.
 The two of them interacted for another few
 hundred years before Han Jue went to Li Yao’s Daoist temple.
 Li Yao was very excited upon seeing him, but
 she tried her best to restrain herself. The two of them chatted for a while before


 Li Yao suppressed her excitement and asked curiously, “What were those just now?”
 Li Yao was moved and looked at him with a gentle gaze.
 She didn’t dare to disturb Han Jue anymore ever since the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity ended. She had always wanted to catch up to him, but she didn’t say anything.
 !!
 “Is there a limit to the number of Dao Creators?” Li Yao asked.
 Han Jue asked, “Why do you ask?”
 “The Dao Creator is undying and
 Han Jue smiled. “There are no restrictions. The only restriction is that it’s very difficult to attain the Dao Creator Realm. It can’t be achieved through hard work. How many years has it been ever since the birth of the Chaos? I don’t know how many trillions of years. But there have only been six Dao Creators in total. You’re only 800 million years old. Han Huang is the same. You’re all too anxious.”
 Li Yao heaved a sigh of relief. It was good that there was no limit to the number of Dao Creators.
 She also felt confident after receiving Han Jue’s guidance.
 The two of them chatted for a while more. Other than cultivation, the only topic was Han Yunjin.
 As Han Yunjin’s biological mother, Li Yao was usually not worried about him at all. She didn’t go out to visit him. It was always him who came to visit her.
 “My potential is strong. I have the strongest potential. Otherwise, how could I give birth to a Primordial Fiendcelestial?”
 “Fine.”
 Li Yao suddenly felt that she shouldn’t be
 unbelievable.
 Thinking of this, she relaxed.
 Han Jue noticed the change in her mentality
 and smiled in satisfaction.
 Li Yao also left the Dao Field not long after he
 left.
 She first went to visit her son.
 Heavenly Dao.
 Han Yunjin was flattered by his mother’s
 arrival and almost lost his manners.
 After all, this was the first time Li Yao had
 Han Yunjin called his wives and children over and bowed to Li Yao.
 Li Yao was very surprised. She did not expect her son to be so flirtatious.
 She was usually busy cultivating and would not pay attention to the outside world, especially her son. She felt that Han Yunjin,
 who had the backing of the Hidden Sect, could not be in danger, so she did not care about
 him at all.
 After his wives and children left, Han Yunjin poured tea for his mother and asked, “Mother, why are you here? Do you need me to do anything?”
 Li Yao smiled. “I just listened to your father
 and came out for a walk. Your father praised you to me. I was wondering if you were really that outstanding. Now, it seems that it’s true. No wonder the Han family is so strong.”
 Han Yunjin blushed. “Cough cough, Mother, you must be joking.’
 He was basically the one expanding the Han
 family. Han Tuo, Han Huang, Han Qing’er, and Han Ling did not have children. Han Huang did, but no one knew Chu Xiaoqi’s identity.
 Li Yao asked about what he was doing
 recently. Han Yunjin replied one by one.
 “Why don’t you create your own Great Dao
 World? How long are you staying in the Heavenly Dao?” Li Yao suddenly asked. Han Yunjin was stunned and asked in surprise, “I can also create a Great Dao World?”
 He thought that his cultivation level had already reached the peak, so he didn’t think too much about it. In any case, he was already
 immortal and had immense power. Why would he need to cultivate more?
 take action.
 Li Yao frowned. “How can you be so dispirited? Do you think you can always keep your position as the leader of the Han family
 “That’s right, Father. Since you’re so
 disappointing, why don’t you give me the position of family leader!”
 A loud laugh sounded as a young man in a beautiful blue robe walked in.
 He came in front of Li Yao and bowed respectfully. “Greetings, Grandma.”
 Li Yao narrowed her eyes. She naturally remembered Heavenly Venerate Xun, the person who had shone in the Great Dao
 Immeasurable Calamity. She did not expect him to be her grandson. “Heavenly Venerate Xun? Ridiculous, how can you use this name?”
 Han Yunjin was shocked and even a little flustered.
 Heavenly Venerate Xun smiled and said, “This
 is the name I’ve chosen recently. How about
 it, Father? Do you feel that it’s impressive?” “How impudent! You’re not allowed to use this name in the future!”
 “Why? Uncle has no objections!”
 “You… don’t listen to me?” “Father, I’ve already grown up. What I said just now was not a joke!” Heavenly Venerate Xun and Han Yunjin were
 at odds with each other, their faces filled with arrogance.
 At this moment, a terrifying pressure descended, causing Heavenly Venerate Xun to
 suddenly kneel. His body trembled as he
 looked at Li Yao in horror. “Grandma…”
 “So rude. It seems that your father didn’t
 teach you well,” Li Yao said expressionlessly. Heavenly Venerate Xun was shocked. He did not expect his grandmother to be so powerful.
 Han Yunjin secretly heaved a sigh of relief.
 With a straight face, he said, “Get out and reflect.”
 Heavenly Venerate Xun wanted to leave, but he could not move.
 “He already offended you like this, but you’re
 still protecting him?” Li Yao looked at Han Yunjin unhappily.
 Han Yunjin said helplessly, “This is not the first time this unfilial son acted like this. He
 just has a dirty mouth. He has never really disobeyed me.”
 Heavenly Venerate Xun looked up at Li Yao angrily with a dissatisfied expression. Li Yao said, “With his personality, he will
 flustered he became. He recalled Heavenly Venerate Xun in the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity. He was indeed too arrogant. Heavenly Venerate Xun gritted his teeth. “I’m not someone who can’t tell right from wrong!”
 Han Yunjin did not speak up for him this
 time.
 He followed Li Yao’s words and became more
 and more shocked. He didn’t want the Hidden Sect to split because of Heavenly Venerate
 Xun.
 Li Yao said, “It just so happens that I want to
 travel. Go to my Sword Domain and reflect.”
 A silver light appeared between her eyebrows
 and sucked Heavenly Venerate Xun in. Han Yunjin hesitated.
 “I’m naturally willing,” Han Yunjin hurriedly
 replied, mainly because he was afraid that something would happen to Heavenly Venerate Xun.
 Just like that, the mother and son left the Heavenly Dao and traveled the blank domain. At the same time, in the Sword Domain. The starry sky was dark. Countless sword shadows were like stars. Heavenly Venerate Xun could not escape this world. He thought that he was only facing the wall to reflect, but when the sword shadows
 he panicked
 attacked him.
