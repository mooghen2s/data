 As the Creator Lord, Han Jue couldn’t tell which Dao Creators could reach the Creator Lord Realm, but he could see how many Dao Creators there were in the future.
 Karma kept changing and the number of future Dao Creators kept increasing.
 The future in which Han Liang and Ji Xianshen became Dao Creators was very distant.
 Ji Xianshen severed karma after he entered the Origin Space-time. However, Han Jue saw him appear space-time again, but the
 in
 karma that had been severed wouldn’t recover
 because of his appearance.
 Heavenly Venerate Xun was previously related to Ji Xianshen. The two of them were now colluding and had even taken in the future Han Liang.
 The gray-robed man who had captured Han Liang was the future Han Liang.
 Now that Han Liang was in Han Jue’s hands, it was very difficult for the three of them to succeed in the future.
 If he was really forced, Han Jue could directly destroy the entire space-time and recreate everything.
 A Dao Creator could also destroy everything below the Dao Creator Realm. The reason why it didn’t happen before was that there were too many Dao Creators and they restrained each other. However, Han Jue could be fearless as the only Creator Lord in existence.
 However, since he could reach the Creator Lord Realm in hundreds of millions of years,
 there might be a second example in the future. Therefore, he couldn’t cultivate in seclusion for too long.
 In the future, it would not only be Ji Xianshen, Han Liang, and Heavenly Venerate Xun. The other Dao Creators would also be the same. There were almost no independent Dao Creators.
 Han Jue looked at Han Liang for a while before continuing to cultivate.
 The three of them could not do anything. The reason why they kept traveling through space and time was that the existence that would suppress them in the future was another Dao Creator faction, the three Primordial Fiendcelestials.
 It was precisely because of this that Heavenly Venerate Xun did not dare to interfere in the
 three Fiendcelestials’ past, afraid that he would disturb them and cause them to pursue him from the future.
 The disciples in the Dao Field came and went. Han Liang’s existence was also known by the entire Hidden Sect. They all knew that he was the Divine Might Heavenly Sage’s grandson and was doted on. He was personally taught by the Divine Might Heavenly Sage. Han Liang’s name began to spread in the Endless Era. The Evil Heavenly Emperor couldn’t help but visit Han Jue in his dreams,
 but he rejected him.
 Han Liang was very important. Han Jue was afraid that the Evil Heavenly Emperor
 couldn’t control him.
 Time passed quickly. Han Liang became stronger day after day, while Chu Xiaoqi was still struggling in the Immortal World.
 Chu Xiaoqi and Chen Jue were two vastly different characters, no one expected them to be related by blood.
 After parting with Chu Xiaoqi, Han Jue didn’t
 care too much about him. In any case, this kid could reincarnate even if he died. He had already helped enough in this life. He still had to walk the path of life himself.
 Of course, part of it was because of Han
 Liang.
 He had another grandson now.
 …
 Ten thousand years passed like smoke.
 On this day, Han Jue was teaching Han Liang in the Daoist temple.
 Han Liang was still so short. He looked like he
 was in his teens. It was difficult to imagine that he was already ten thousand years old.
 Han Liang sat in front of him with a vexed expression. He really couldn’t understand the Mystical Power Han Jue had just taught.
 It was normal to find it difficult to understand because Han Jue was teaching the Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal!
 Han Liang did not have the Ultimate Origin
 Power, so he would create his own Heaven
 Seal. So far, Han Liang’s race had yet to be named.
 The name was very important, especially for such a Creation Race, so Han Jue didn’t take
 the initiative and let Han Liang discover and define it himself.
 Han Jue used his Dao voice to help Han Liang as his brows quickly relaxed.
 At this moment, Han Jue seemed to sense
 something. He left a clone in the Daoist
 temple and his main body jumped out of the Dao Field.
 He came to the Dao Mystic Realm and arrived
 at an Immortal World.
 At this moment, the Divine Clan was attacking the nearby Devil World. The Dao Mystic Realm had been established
 for a period of time. The various worlds in the mystic realm had already begun to interact. The so-called Devil World was actually another Divine Clan. If they did not define the
 enemy as the Devil Race, it would not be easy to mobilize morale.
 As an Immortal God, Chu Xiaoqi naturally had
 to participate. At this moment, he was targeted.
 What targeted him was not the living beings
 of the two worlds, but an existence that
 surpassed the Dao Mystic Realm. Huang Zuntian!
 Chu Xiaoqi traveled through the starry sky in
 an extremely sorry state.
 No matter where he fled, every time he turned around, Huang Zuntian would follow behind him, scaring him so much that he continued to escape.
 Huang Zuntian kept chasing after Chu Xiaoqi
 as he thought to himself, “Where did this kid
 after the Dao Mystic Realm was established for a period of time.
 Huang Zuntian also personally checked the
 Dao Mystic Realm. Chu Xiaoqi attracted him. His potential was average, but he could not deduce this person’s future.
 If it were any other mighty figure, they would probably not notice Chu Xiaoqi. However, Huang Zuntian was once a Calamity Life
 Controller and was extremely sensitive to
 this.
 He felt that Chu Xiaoqi was definitely not simple. After being chased for a long time, Chu Xiaoqi suddenly stopped and cursed. “Dog, kill me already! Stop humiliating me!”
 He was considered firm, but he still trembled
 in fear when Huang Zuntian appeared in front
 of him. Huang Zuntian wore a dignified black robe with the figure of the Primordial Fiendcelestial printed on it. His aura was definitely the strongest existence Chu Xiaoqi had ever seen. He was even stronger than his
 grandfather and the master of the Divine Clan.
 In front of such an existence, he, Chu Xiaoqi, could not escape at all.
 However, Chu Xiaoqi still wanted to die
 heroically.
 Unfortunately, he still couldn’t find Tang Wan or see his grandfather again. After ten thousand years, Chu Xiaoqi’s impression of Tang Wan and his grandfather was no longer that deep. He was already
 independent, but he still missed them occasionally.
 Huang Zuntian asked, “Tell me about your
 life.”
 Chu Xiaoqi cursed. “Just search my soul if you have the ability!”
 Huang Zuntian immediately reached out. Chu
 Xiaoqi froze and could not move. However, Huang Zuntian searched for Chu Xiaoqi’s memories but found nothing. It was
 as if they were blank. He was shocked.
 Dao Creator!
 Creator!
 If he was really a Dao Creator, he would
 definitely be warned and might even die. But
 now…
 only one possibility. The other party tolerated
 him.
 Huang Zuntian immediately retracted his hand. Chu Xiaoqi woke up and looked at him
 warily.


 Chu Xiaoqi was stunned. He couldn’t believe
 his ears.
 This twist…
 !!
 Huang Zuntian stared at him and said, “It’s difficult for you to escape this world with your current potential. As for me, I can bring you to a higher sky. Think about it carefully. I won’t kill you even if you refuse. Farewell.” Chu Xiaoqi’s heart beat faster.
 No wonder this fellow did not kill him previously.
 Chu Xiaoqi took a deep breath and asked, “What’s your cultivation level? Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal?”
 “Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal?
 Hahahaha!”
 Huang Zuntian laughed wantonly, his tone filled with disdain and mockery.
 Chu Xiaoqi was shocked. To be so disdainful of the legendary Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal, could this person be an illusory Sage in the legends?
 If he did not capture such a mighty figure…
 Ever since he left his grandfather, although he had encountered opportunities, they were not opportunities that could allow him to be reborn. He gradually realized his mediocreness, but he had always been holding back his anger, something called unwillingness.
 Chu Xiaoqi gritted his teeth and asked, “Why do you think highly of me?”
 Huang Zuntian said bluntly, “You had a great opportunity in your previous life. Your providence is unpredictable. Perhaps you’re very weak now, but I feel that you might be extraordinary in the future. Perhaps I’m the benefactor who will help you soar. It depends on whether you’re willing to believe me.”
 Chu Xiaoqi couldn’t help but think of the grandfather he had met when he was young. Could it be that his grandfather had also taken a liking to him because of his providence?
 Indeed, I was born extraordinary!
 Chu Xiaoqi hesitated for a moment but still
 chose to follow Huang Zuntian.
 The reason was very simple. He could no
 longer grow in the Divine Clan. He deeply realized how weak he was in this war between the gods and devils. Chen Jue’s attacks were unstoppable. In contrast, he was only cannon fodder.
 They clearly entered the Divine Race in the same batch, and Chen Jue was the same age as him…
 Huang Zuntian said, “I’ll show you how tiny you are first.”
 He waved his right hand and brought Chu Xiaoqi to the top of the Dao Mystic Realm. Chu Xiaoqi looked down and saw countless grains of light scattered in all directions.
 and the netherworld,” Huang Zuntian introduced, causing Chu Xiaoqi’s eyes to
 widen.
 How big was the Immortal World he was in? From this angle, it was actually so small.
 Huang Zuntian brought him out of the Dao Mystic Realm and arrived at the blank
 domain.
 Unlike the universe in the Dao Mystic Realm,
 the starry sky was pale, but there were still dense lights of various colors dotted in all
 directions.
 “Where we were just now is one of the worlds
 below. It contains the small world I introduced to you earlier. There are as many
 as stars.”
 Huang Zuntian’s introduction shocked Chu
 Xiaoqi.
 A heaven beyond the heavens!
 This was Chu Xiaoqi’s feeling now.
 At this moment, a figure appeared in front of
 Huang Zuntian, scaring Chu Xiaoqi so much that he took a step back. It was the master of the Dao Mystic Realm, Formless World, the Ten Absolute Prodigy of the first Chaotic
 Assembly.
 Formless World looked even more dignified
 than before. Its aura was not inferior to
 Huang Zuntian’s.
 Formless World sized up Chu Xiaoqi, making
 him extremely nervous. He had no choice but
 to hide behind Huang Zuntian. “This child’s foundation is average. It’s only you,
 hard to predict his fate. It’s because of
 Chu Xiaoqi was isolated by the former. Other
 than a Dao Creator, the other existences could not spy from afar.
 Huang Zuntian said, “Yes, he’s my disciple. I
 plan to nurture him and leave him in your
 Dao Mystic Realm. You have no objections, right?”
 Formless World smiled. “Of course. I’ll take care of him.”
 “There’s no need for that. Let him grow up on
 his own. When he grows up, he will owe you a
 favor, and so will I.”
 “Fellow Daoist, you must be joking. What favor can we owe each other?”
 Formless World smiled and disappeared. This
 was what he wanted to say, so he did not stay
 any longer to prevent Huang Zuntian from returning.
 After all, Huang Zuntian’s Primordial Chaos was more suitable for cultivation than the Dao Mystic Realm. There was no need to let Chu Xiaoqi stay here.
 Chu Xiaoqi swallowed and asked carefully,
 “Who was that just now?”
 Huang Zuntian said indifferently, “You’re not qualified to interact with him.”
 “Tch, like my grandfather.” Chu Xiaoqi curled her lips. “Oh? Who’s your grandfather?” Huang Zuntian asked curiously.
 “Someone I met when I was young. I don’t know his identity, either.”
 Chu Xiaoqi didn’t think too much and replied directly. With Huang Zuntian’s cultivation level, he shouldn’t lie to him. Besides, Han Jue
 didn’t ask him not to say anything about their interactions.
 At least, there was no such scene in Chu Xiaoqi’s memories. In any case, more than ten thousand years had passed and this experience was no longer important. “Then show me his appearance,” Huang Zuntian instructed.
 Chu Xiaoqi waved his hand, and a figure shining with divine light appeared in front of him. He was stunned and cast another spell.
 No matter how he cast his spell, he could not
 show the face in his mind. This feeling was extremely strange, causing Chu Xiaoqi’s blood to run cold.
 Huang Zuntian was stunned.
 It was really him…
 Huang Zuntian said in a low voice, “Alright,
 from now on, don’t tell anyone about your experience with this person. Just pretend that this grandfather never existed, understand?”
 Chu Xiaoqi retracted his hand and nodded.
 He muttered in his heart.
 His grandfather did not seem simple. Even such an existence was so afraid. Chu Xiaoqi was about to ask Huang Zuntian if
 he knew his grandfather, but he waved his
 hand and brought him back to the Immortal World.
 The two of them landed in a forest. Without
 waiting for Chu Xiaoqi to say anything, Huang Zuntian began to teach him a cultivation technique.
 Chu Xiaoqi’s cultivation technique was too ordinary. Cultivating to the Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm was already the limit.
 Huang Zuntian prepared to teach Chu Xiaoqi his legacy.
 Since he was someone that Master valued, he would teach him everything.
 Han Jue stood in the blank domain and
 witnessed Huang Zuntian’s performance. Not bad.
 It was good to let Chu Xiaoqi follow him. He
 had walked a heaven-defying path. If Chu Xiaoqi followed him, he might be able to learn a lot.
 Han Jue stared at Chu Xiaoqi and sighed. The two grandsons he had personally taken care of were not good people. One was Primordial Despair’s reincarnation, and the other wanted to destroy everything.
 He wondered how their future relationship
 would be.
 Han Jue suddenly looked forward to it.
 It would be interesting even if they became
 opponents.
 As for Chen Jue whom Chu Xiaoqi respected, Han Jue didn’t care about him. Chen Jue was only one of his countless descendants. He was just lucky to receive the
 Creation Heaven’s Chosen. It was nothing
 much.
 More descendants would obtain the Creation Heaven’s Chosen in the future.
 Han Jue watched for a while before disappearing. On the other side.
 In the Primordial Hall. Han Huang opened his eyes and frowned.
 “Why can’t my Primordial Chaos condense
 the Supreme Rules…” Han Huang muttered to himself in frustration.
 Only a world with rules was considered a world. Only a world with Great Dao rules was considered a world, the same was true of the Great Dao World. However, to reach the Dao Creator Realm, the Great Dao World had to
 condense Supreme Rules.


 Ever since the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity ended, although Han Huang had obtained a huge opportunity, he discovered that it was very difficult for his cultivation level to increase, as if he had already reached his limit.
 He was a Primordial Fiendcelestial. How could he have a limit?
 Could it be that the potential of those Dao Creators was stronger than his?
 Impossible!
 !!
 Han Huang fell into deep thought. Could it be that he had killed too many people, causing the Primordial Chaos to be unable to transform?
 However, he had observed the other Great Dao Worlds. Other than the Great Dao World of the Dao Creator, the other Great Dao Worlds could not successfully condense the Supreme Rules. In other words, the existences at the perfected Great Dao Supreme Realm were temporarily on the same starting line.
 The Dao Creators did not guide the Great Dao Supremes. Even if their own people asked, they would only answer. The path to
 Just as Han Huang was feeling frustrated, footsteps came from the darkness beside him. A figure slowly walked over.
 Han Huang was not surprised. He didn’t even turn around.
 “It takes time to condense your Great Dao World. How long did it take the Chaos to evolve? How long has your Primordial Chaos been evolving?”
 The red-eyed black shadow smiled with a mocking tone.
 Han Huang snorted. “I know. But even if it takes time, you can at least sense the
 progress, right?”
 The red-eyed black shadow said, “There are a
 total of five Dao Creators now. Your father is one of them. Why don’t you ask him for guidance?”
 Han Huang sighed. “How can I have the face to look for him again?”
 He was not Chu Xiaoqi. He was born to be
 strong. With his unparalleled talent, if he could not rely on his father, he would try his best not to.
 The red-eyed black shadow snorted. “How pretentious. Your body was given by your parents and your father saved you many
 times. Do you really think you relied on yourself? You started from the beginning and
 reason why you can’t succeed.”
 Han Huang’s expression instantly turned
 ugly, but he was not angry.
 The red-eyed black shadow continued to mock him. “Now there are three Primordial Fiendcelestials: you, Primordial Origin, and Huang Zuntian. Your potential is no longer unique. Put down your arrogance.
 “So what if I let go of my arrogance? If Father could guide the path of a Dao Creator, the Hidden Sect would have long produced a second Dao Creator. It’s the same for the
 other Dao Creators.”
 “Perhaps they don’t want anyone to reach the
 Dao Creator Realm, even if they’re on their side. Because the Dao Creator Realm is supreme, there are very few of them.”
 “I
 …
 Han Huang was silent. The red-eyed black
 shadow did not say anything else and retreated into the darkness.
 The hall was silent.
 Han Huang slowly stood up. His gaze
 darkened as he muttered, “Perhaps I should really look for Father.”
 He disappeared into the hall.
 Several days later, Han Jue received Han
 Huang.
 Han Huang asked about the method to attain
 the Dao. Han Jue didn’t say anything else and directly preached the Dao, telling him his creation experience. Han Jue was naturally not stingy with his son.
 However, the Dao Creator’s method to attain the Dao was extremely difficult. It was useless to know how to build the Great Dao World.
 After all, every Great Dao World was different.
 If one wanted to attain the Dao, one had to rely on potential or epiphany.
 Dao Creator with the potential of the Ultimate Origin Fiendcelestial. It was not difficult. However, he couldn’t tell Han Huang this
 directly.
 After a long time, when Han Jue finished speaking, Han Huang woke up. He hurriedly bowed to express his gratitude.
 The father and son did not exchange pleasantries. Han Huang left.
 Han Jue couldn’t help but shake his head
 upon seeing Han Huang’s excited expression. Will he hate me if he still fails?
 Han Jue had already seen Han Huang develop
 mental demons. This kid even created mental demons into clones and often talked to them.
 This time, Han Huang came because the mental demon clone persuaded him. It was not impossible for father and son to
 fight. Han Jue looked at the future. Han Huang’s
 future continued until he reached the Dao Creator Realm. Although he had always treated him as a target, he had never crossed the line with him.
 The future was endless.
 Han Jue retracted his gaze and continued
 cultivating.
 He suddenly felt that time passed very slowly ever since the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity ended. Perhaps his cultivation level had increased too slowly, causing his
 cultivation passion to decrease greatly.
 No!
 He could not be numbed!
 Those Dao Creators were so relaxed, causing them to be unable to improve. However, he couldn’t cultivate blindly. The
 Ninth Chaos buried his head in cultivation
 and gave Han Jue a chance to rise. The Ninth Chaos probably couldn’t understand even until his death. He had only taken a nap. Why did he give Han Jue a chance? How did Han Jue create a Dao Field
 that even a Dao Creator couldn’t enter in so little time?
 Han Jue needed to cultivate, but he couldn’t cultivate too much.
 He looked at the corner where a ball of gray Qi
 floated. It was the Ninth Chaos’ will. It was being enslaved by the Ultimate Origin Heavenly Prison. The disciples entering and leaving did not sense anything special about
 the gray Qi.
 Han Liang was once curious about it, but he
 was chased away by Han Jue and never dared to approach it again.
 Han Liang was not afraid of anything but Han Jue. Perhaps it was his bloodline suppression. The Ultimate Origin Fiendcelestial’s bloodline was stronger than his bloodline, after all.
 …
 Under the old tree, Han Liang opened his eyes
 It
 and looked angrily at a man beside him. was Han Jue’s grand-disciple, Murong Qi. “Didn’t you agree to have the same cultivation level as me?” Han Liang said angrily as he clenched his fists.
 Murong
 our
 Qi smiled. “Yes, I did suppress my cultivation, but the difference between bodies can’t be suppressed.”
 Han Liang turned his head away, looking like
 he would not listen.
 “Ah! Why are you leaving! I’ve never played it before!” “Forget it. You can’t afford it. “No, Brother Murong, I was wrong!” Han
 Liang hugged Murong Qi’s right leg and said pitifully.
 Murong Qi had no choice but to sit back down. Han Liang was now the favored son of the
 entire Dao Field. Because of his temperament and body, everyone liked him. “Brother Murong, can you tell me about the outside world? Don’t you often wander
 outside?” Han Liang asked curiously and stopped the simulation trial.
 He did not like to be tortured, either. Murong Qi did not hide anything. He talked about his experiences outside. Sometimes, he was excited, sometimes he sighed. Han Liang
 widened his eyes and clenched his fists, exclaiming.
 “Han Liang, do you want to go out too?”
 Murong Qi rubbed Han Liang’s head and asked with a smile.
 Han Liang nodded. “Of course. I’m already
 tired of staying in the Dao Field, but Grandpa doesn’t let me out.”
 Murong Qi smiled. “Indeed, we shouldn’t go out. Once we go out, it’s very difficult to return. It’s not only that you don’t want to return, but your grandfather won’t let you cultivate beside him anymore. The greatest opportunity in the world is your grandfather. You have to think about it.”
 Han Liang tilted his head and fell into deep
 thought.
 life. You have to find the true meaning of your
 life.”
 Han Liang said in a low voice, “I want to go to
 a place that has never been discovered.”


 “A place that has never been discovered?”
 Murong Qi couldn’t help but laugh. Was there anything in the world that his grandfather did not know?
 Your grandfather is the strongest.
 Han Liang said with a yearning expression, “I’ve been thinking about how high the sky is and how far the surroundings are. Brother Murong, I keep feeling that something is summoning me from afar.”
 !!
 Murong Qi smiled. “Then cultivate well. With your current cultivation level, it won’t be long before you’re eaten alive.”
 “Tch, you only know how to scare me.’
 “How many people in the simulation trial are you unable to defeat? This is only our Dao Field. Think about how many people are outside.”
 “But I can’t see those people in the Dao Field. They must be outsiders.”
 “You’re quite smart.”
 “Of course!”
 The two of them chatted casually.
 Han Liang couldn’t leave the Dao Field
 without Han Jue’s approval. It was useless
 even if he begged Murong Qi.
 After Murong Qi left, other disciples
 They were both biological grandsons, but Chu Xiaoqi was not so lucky.
 Huang Zuntian left after passing down his legacy to Chu Xiaoqi, leaving him to wander alone.
 Under Huang Zuntian’s instructions, Chu Xiaoqi resigned from the position of Immortal God. This caused the Divine Clan to be dissatisfied. If the Immortal Gods wanted to retreat, what dignity would the Divine Clan have? Therefore, Chu Xiaoqi was hunted down.
 Chu Xiaoqi regretted it. He had a good impression of the Divine Clan, so he went back to say goodbye. If he had known earlier, he would have pretended to be dead and fled. In any case, the Divine Clan might not remember him.
 Chu Xiaoqi had been reborn after obtaining
 Huang Zuntian’s inheritance. Ordinary immortals were not his match at all.
 Under the pursuit of the Divine Race, Chu Xiaoqi became famous until he met Chen Jue.
 Because Chu Xiaoqi was difficult to deal with, the Divine Clan had no choice but to send
 Chen Jue.
 Chu Xiaoqi had special feelings for Chen Jue before. Even if Chen Jue did not know him, he still felt very pressured when he blocked his
 way.
 “Chu Xiaoqi, surrender!”
 Chen Jue wore the silver armor of the Divine
 Clan and had phoenix wings on his crown. His cloak fluttered in the air. Just his aura was enough to make people think of the words “War God”.
 Chu Xiaoqi’s appearance was also outstanding, but he would always feel
 ashamed in front of Chen Jue.
 Chen Jue frowned. “On account that we are
 the same batch of immortals, I don’t want to attack you. Surrender!”
 He continued to approach Chu Xiaoqi.
 A strange black pattern suddenly appeared between Chu Xiaoqi’s eyebrows. Calamity Life Controller, he had actually been given the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority by Huang Zuntian!
 Chu Xiaoqi planned to go all out as he faced the famous Chen Jue.
 Chu Xiaoqi’s speed was extremely fast. Before
 Chen Jue could react, he attacked from behind him and waved his palm. This palm struck out thousands of stars and quickly expanded. The rapidly expanding stars collided with Chen Jue and sent him flying into the sky.
 Boom! Boom! Boom…
 Chen Jue was caught off guard and fell to the
 ends of the world.
 These stars were all as big as mountains. They exploded the moment they hit Chen Jue. Chen Jue was unable to withstand it.
 “This kid…”
 Chen Jue was shocked and had no choice but
 to use his Mystical Power to dodge. Just as he appeared, another star collided with
 him, followed by countless stars, making him
 dizzy.
 Chen Jue continued to move, but no matter
 how he moved, the stars chased after him.
 This was Chu Xiaoqi’s special ability as a Calamity Life Controller. Every Calamity Life Controller would obtain their own special
 ability when they obtained the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority. It was equivalent to an Innate Mystical Power.
 Chu Xiaoqi could already use his ability
 proficiently. He felt that it was very domineering and almost invincible.
 Chen Jue was suppressed.
 These stars were made with his Dharmic
 powers. They were no different from true
 stars.
 After Huang Zuntian’s guidance, Chu Xiaoqi and Chen Jue’s cultivation levels were already very close, so his Mystical Power was enough
 to suppress the latter. “I’m too strong!”
 Chu Xiaoqi was excited. Huang Zuntian’s
 image in his heart soared.
 The Mystical Power his master had taught him could even suppress Chen Jue! Chu Xiaoqi was satisfied and was not in a
 hurry to escape. He kept using his Mystical Powers and pressed Chen Jue to the ground. Soon, his divine armor shattered and he was covered in blood. He was in an extremely sorry state.
 Chen Jue was also extremely angry. These stars were too annoying. They were simply his counter, making him unable to counterattack.
 Chu Xiaoqi suddenly couldn’t bear it. After all,
 when Chen Jue first found him, he did not
 directly attack. After thinking about it, Chu Xiaoqi retracted his hand and transformed into a beam of light that disappeared into the
 sky. However, Chen Jue rushed out of the ruins and chased after him again.
 In terms of speed, Chu Xiaoqi was far inferior
 to Chen Jue.
 After Chen Jue caught up, Chu Xiaoqi used his
 Mystical Power to suppress him again.
 Chu Xiaoqi panicked as the cycle repeated.
 Although Chen Jue could not defeat him, he could not kill him either. His Dharmic powers were about to be exhausted, but Chen Jue was
 still at his peak.
 Impossible!
 Was this fellow’s Dharmic powers endless?
 Chu Xiaoqi roared in his heart as jealousy
 surged. Talent!
 He knew that the amount of Dharmic powers was not only related to cultivation techniques but also potential.
 At the same realm, the Dharmic powers of a prodigy far exceeded ordinary potential! In the end, Chen Jue’s divine spear pierced
 through the sky and space when Chu Xiaoqi’s Dharmic powers were about to be exhausted. It pierced through Chu Xiaoqi, causing blood to burst out. Chu Xiaoqi fell and smashed into
 the sea below, startling thousands of feet of
 waves.
 Chu Xiaoqi’s consciousness faded. He could vaguely see a figure crashing through the sea and swimming towards him. Damn it…
 I’m still too weak…
 Chu Xiaoqi sighed. If he couldn’t even defeat
 Chen Jue, how could he jump out of the Immortal World and admire the higher sky?
 He thought of his grandfather and Tang Wan. Indignant!
 He was really indignant! Although he was unwilling to give up, Chu
 Xiaoqi had already reached his limit. He fell unconscious.
 In the Dao Field, Han Jue opened his eyes and
 sighed faintly.
 Han Liang opened his eyes and looked at his grandfather curiously. Grandpa rarely sighed.
 He wanted to ask, but he was afraid of being
 scolded.
 Han Jue smiled and asked, “You have a brother who is training outside and has no one to help him. He’s about to die. Do you think I should help him?”
 Han Liang widened his eyes and suddenly
 stood up. “Of course, you have to help him! Grandpa, bring me along. If anyone dares to bully my brother, I’ll tear them apart!”
 “Hehe, you want to go out? No way.” “So be it, but Grandpa, you have to save him. If you don’t save him, you definitely won’t save me if anything happens to me in the future.”
 Han Liang curled his lips and pretended to be aggrieved.
 Han Jue smiled. “Aren’t you afraid that he’s stronger than you?”
 Han Liang scratched his head. “So what if
 he’s stronger than me? Many people in the Hidden Sect are stronger than me!” Han Jue sensed that he was telling the truth
 and didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. Was this kid’s talent misdirected? Wasn’t he born with the instinct to destroy everything?


 “Grandpa, hurry up. Don’t miss the
 opportunity!”
 Han Liang came to Han Jue’s side and shook his arm. He looked like a spoiled child, not like a little boy, but more like a girl.
 Han Jue smiled and said, “He was already saved while we were talking.”
 !!
 Han Liang’s eyes widened. “Who saved him?”
 “Of course it was me.”
 “Wow, Grandpa, you didn’t move just now! Could it be that you have a clone?”
 “Grandpa can save him with a thought.” “Wow!”
 Han Jue pulled Han Liang into his arms and rubbed his head. He smiled and said, “You have many siblings, but most of them are far younger than you. They might not be that close to you, but in my eyes, your potential is the best. In the future, you have to protect your siblings and juniors, understand?”
 Han Liang was overjoyed. His grandfather’s praise was higher than any achievement!
 He nodded enthusiastically and patted his chest, promising.
 So far, Han Liang’s performance was still quite satisfactory.
 …
 Primordial Hall.
 Han Huang opened his eyes and frowned. He muttered, “Why doesn’t it work?”
 The red-eyed black shadow walked out of the darkness and smiled. “This means that your father doesn’t want to guide you at all. Like the other Dao Creators, they don’t want a new Dao Creator to appear. This is also the reason why your father hid in the Dao Field after attaining the Dao.”
 Han Huang snorted. “My father isn’t like this.”
 “That means that your father’s method cannot be used again. Everyone has their own path. Perhaps your limit is the Great Dao Supreme Realm. Don’t think that the Primordial Fiendcelestial is unparalleled in the world. Don’t forget, the Chaos replaced the Primordial Chaos. The Primordial Chaos’ potential should be weaker than the Chaos. However, you use all the living beings in the Chaos as your standard. The true standard is the Ninth Chaos who created the Chaos, the once strongest Dao Creator!”
 The red-eyed black shadow’s words made Han Huang silent and fall into self-doubt.
 He thought of the power he had relied on previously. It was his father’s Dharmic
 powers.
 His Primordial Fiendcelestial bloodline was also given to him by his father.
 Was there a possibility?
 Actually, he was not a Primordial
 Fiendcelestial at all. Furthermore, his mother
 couldn’t give birth to him. Instead, his father sacrificed his bloodline to cause his birth.
 not a true Primordial Fiendcelestial. Or rather, the Primordial Fiendcelestial can’t reach the Dao Creator Realm at all. Father broke through a higher bloodline restriction… Han Huang was enlightened and felt relieved.
 The red-eyed black shadow saw his expression and smiled like a crescent moon before disappearing into the darkness.
 Han Huang relaxed a lot after he put down the burden of the Primordial Fiendcelestial. He stood up and smiled. “I’m confused. How can
 I create my own Great Dao World if I don’t see the various forms of all living beings? Perhaps my bias is too deep, that’s why I can’t create my own Great Dao World.”
 He stepped forward and walked towards the
 door.
 “Primordial Chaos, what is the Primordial Chaos…”
 Han Huang’s voice became softer and softer as his figure walked further and further away.
 …
 The blue sky and blue sea were cloudless.
 Cliff after cliff cut through the endless sea. Countless waves slapped the mountain wall, stirring up countless white waves.
 Chu Xiaoqi and Chen Jue sat at the edge of the
 cliff. Chu Xiaoqi stretched lazily and looked at Chen Jue beside him. He smiled and said, “I didn’t expect this, I didn’t expect this!” Chen Jue changed into a green robe and looked at the sky calmly. The sea breeze blew
 his hair, making him look extremely carefree. Even Chu Xiaoqi was a little jealous. In terms of handsomeness, this man was second only to his grandfather.
 “Why did you save me? Why did you betray
 the Divine Clan with me?” Chu Xiaoqi asked curiously.
 He thought that he was doomed. Unexpectedly, when he opened his eyes, he discovered that he was not dead. Chen Jue had
 saved him and even said that he would betray the immortals with him.
 Chen Jue said calmly, “I don’t have a good impression of the Immortal Gods, to begin with. I just treated them as a springboard. As for you, you’re the stupidest person I’ve ever seen. Clearly, no Immortal God remembers you, but you still came back to tell them you were leaving. You’re simply a fool. However,
 your strength is not bad. I see you in a different light.’

 Chu Xiaoqi curled his lips. How true.
 However, Chen Jue was indeed powerful. In any case, Chu Xiaoqi was convinced. He asked curiously, “Then, what do you plan to do next?”
 “What are your plans?”
 “Of course, I’m gonna wander the world!”
 “Me too.”
 “So, you really want to follow me?”
 “The fact that you dare to return means that
 you are responsible. You dare to face the pursuit of the Immortal Gods and not
 surrender. Such spirit is qualified to follow me.”
 “Follow you? Tch, you should be the one following me!”
 The two of them began to bicker. The two of
 them looked at each other, but their lips were actually curled up.
 Chu Xiaoqi was very happy. It had been a long
 Actually, he had chosen Chu Xiaoqi because, in the previous battle, Chu Xiaoqi had no intention of killing him. In the first half of the battle, he had been beaten. He could sense
 that Chu Xiaoqi had an even stronger power that had yet to erupt.
 It was not only Chu Xiaoqi. Chen Jue couldn’t
 bear to kill him, either.
 This feeling was ridiculous.
 In fact, from the moment the two of them met, Chen Jue had a deep impression of Chu Xiaoqi. Chu Xiaoqi was secretly observing him, and so was he.
 It was precisely because of this that he
 especially accepted the mission to hunt him down.
 Somehow, the two of them seemed to be
 fated.
 For the time being, Chen Jue could not think
 that this fate might be a trap because he and Chu Xiaoqi had no karma in the past. “Chen Jue, what’s your cultivation goal?” “You first.”
 “I want to see the scenery of the world. I want
 ||
 Chen Jue curled his lips and talked about his
 goal in high spirits.
 Chu Xiaoqi regained his chatterbox personality and bragged non-stop. Far away in the third Dao Field.
 Han Jue slowly smiled. He was cultivating, and so was Han Liang. No one noticed that the corners of his mouth were lifted. In the eyes of invincible people, fate in this
 world was karma.
 Xiaoqi and Chen Jue was because of Fang Liang and Ji Xianshen.
 Some friendships could last a long time. Han Jue could see through Chen Jue’s personality at a glance. It was worth handing Chu Xiaoqi over to him.
 Chu Xiaoqi could give his back to Chen Jue.
 Hooking up with Chu Xiaoqi was equivalent to having Han Huang as a backing.
 Han Huang was a future Dao Creator. Such a
 background was definitely worth giving up everything.
 Although Chen Jue had the Heaven’s Chosen Creation, he would have many such descendants in the future. The difference in seniority was too great. Furthermore, Han Jue was prepared to accumulate a large number of Heaven’s Chosen Creation attempts.
