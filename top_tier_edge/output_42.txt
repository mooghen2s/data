 Han Yu respectfully sat down behind him. Fang Liang did not say much, but the new Sage Tian Zhan was especially curious about Han Yu.
 Heavenly Venerate Wufa snorted. “You didn’t mention Fellow Daoist Han’s name?”
 Ji Xianshen said, “Our Heavenly Race has many geniuses. We can accept this battle.”
 Tian Zhan nodded with a proud expression.
 Fang Liang reminded, “It’s better to be safe than sorry. It’s best to send the strongest Pseudo-Sage.”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du revealed a rare smile and said, “We have countless geniuses. I really can’t say who is the number one in the world.”
 Tian Zhan said, “Send my disciple. He fought ten Pseudo-Sages of the Calamity Race alone and was not at a disadvantage. He’s the number one prodigy of the Heavenly Race.”
  Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du glanced at Ji Xianshen, who nodded.
 Ji Xianshen hesitated for a moment and said, “We won’t lose this battle. Tian Zhan will lose his Sage position if we do.”
 Tian Zhan was moved and his eyes became
 firm.
 After returning, he still had to teach his disciples and prepare some methods. He couldn’t afford to lose.
 Han Yu sat behind Fang Liang and listened to the Sages’ conversation. He was secretly shocked.
 From the looks of it, Sages were not on the same level. There were also differences among Sages.
 A new Sage could be demoted just like that!
 The ancestor was at least on the same level as Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du, right?
 Han Yu thought silently.
 He knew that Han Jue was very strong, but the one in charge of the Heavenly Dao was Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du. Some people even joked that Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du was the leader, and the Divine Might Heavenly Sage was the Heavenly Dao’s faith.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du was in charge of managing the Heavenly Dao, while the Divine Might Heavenly Sage was in charge of intimidating the Chaos!
 “This matter is settled. We must take down the Chaotic Sea of Fire. It concerns the future of the Heavenly Dao for billions of years.”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said softly, “By the way, the next new Sage has been decided. It’s the person behind Fellow Daoist Fang, the personal disciple of the former Heavenly Dao Sage Li Daokong, the master of Buzhou Divine Mountain.”
 Heavenly Venerate Wufa, Pan Xin, Fang Liang, and Ji Xianshen nodded. It was not strange.
 Tian Zhan was enlightened. So that was the case. This person’s identity was so great. No wonder he could enter the Sage Realm early.
 Han Yu hurriedly bowed. He didn’t expect this matter to be settled so quickly. There was not even a formality.
 Then, Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du waved his sleeve and the Sages left, leaving Han Yu in the hall.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du looked at him and smiled. “You look really similar to Fellow Daoist Han. Speaking of which, you taught Qin Ling, right? This child is impressive. He will be the Heavenly Dao’s guardian in the future.”
 Han Yu said, “It’s all thanks to the Sages that my grand-disciple can have today’s creation.”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du asked, “Do you think all of this is hypocritical and even sinful?”
 Han Yu was stunned and remained silent.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “I saw a hint of disdain in your eyes earlier. Do you think that Sages are numb and heartless because of Qin Ling and treat all things in the world as pawns?”
 Han Yu was still silent.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “So what if it’s a shocking lie? This lie will indeed attract innocent living beings to die. However, this loss is nothing in the calamity before the Heavenly Dao.
 “There is no absolute peace. If the Sages did not open the Chaotic Heavenly Road, all living beings will be attacked by the Inauspicious Evil when they head to the Dark Forbidden Zone. The Heavenly Dao is so closed off, but the number of living beings has reached the limit. They even have to snatch Spirit Qi to breathe. What kind of scene is that?”
 Han Yu was moved. He was not a pedantic person. He also understood the overall situation of the Sages, but he was a little unhappy that they were deceiving all living beings.
 Kind lies were also lies, especially to those who believed them and died. This was a sin.
 Han Yu was deep in thought.
 After a long while…
 He bowed to Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du and said, “Thank you for your guidance, Sage.”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “It’s fine. I’ll preach the Dao for you and increase your cultivation. You’re still short of the Sage position.”
 Han Yu was ashamed and could only nod.
 …
 In the blink of an eye.
 Han Jue entered seclusion for another fifty thousand years. He opened his eyes and stretched.
 Only after fifty thousand years could he feel the improvement in his cultivation.
 He really wanted to enter seclusion and break through in one go.
 It might appear to be a dream once he ignored everything
 Unfortunately, he still cared about his disciples.
 He opened the emails.
 (Your grand-disciple Chu Shiren transformed into billions of Dharma Idols and walked in the Chaotic Space-Time.]
 [Your good friend Jiang Yi has absorbed the power of the Chaotic Sun Star and his cultivation has increased.]
 [Your good friend Evil Heavenly Emperor was attacked by your good friend Divine Robe Daoist.]
 (Your good friend Di Jiang was attacked by your good friend Divine Robe Daoist.]
 (Your good friend Nüwa…]
 (Your good friend Huang Zuntian was cursed by a mysterious curse.]
 [Your good friend Ancestor Xitian has received guidance from your good friend Dao Ancestor. His cultivation has increased.]
 Why was the Divine Robe Daoist fighting with the Evil Heavenly Emperor and the Great Dao Sages in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End?
 Fortunately, he was not severely injured. It was probably a small fight.
 Han Jue noticed that Ancestor Xitian had established a connection with the Dao Ancestor.
 The Dao Ancestor had revived?
 No.
 It was probably still his will.
 Speaking of which, the Dao Ancestor and Pangu were really mysterious. They looked like they had died, but they would cause trouble from time to time.
 Han Jue continued reading. The Devil Ancestor should have been well-behaved recently. Han Tuo and Yi Tian had been cultivating in seclusion, and so had the Life faction.
 Chaotic peace was good.
 Everyone cultivated in peace.
  When I’m invincible, if you cause trouble again, give me a stage and a chance.
 Han Jue thought to himself.
 Although he was already a Great Dao Sage, he rarely interacted with others. He had developed a scheming personality. Only then did he not find cultivation boring.
 He looked forward to the content of the emails every time his seclusion ended.
 After reading the emails, Han Jue looked at the Immortal World.
 Qin Ling had already broken the seal. He did not immediately take revenge but cultivated in seclusion in the Divine Palace.
 The Immeasurable Calamity would officially begin after Qin Ling became a Pseudo-Sage.
 Too early!
 Han Jue thought of the ten thousand Divine Authority Generals. He didn’t know where they were now. They hadn’t appeared in his emails yet.
 (Detected that the Strength Fiendcelestial has been successfully nurtured and is about to stir up the chaos. You have the following choices:]nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎


 (1: Exit seclusion immediately and kill the Strength Fiendcelestial. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment and a Creation Spirit Stone.]
 [2: Cultivate in a low-profile manner and do not participate in the conflict. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment and a Creation Spirit Stone.)
 The Strength Fiendcelestial should be Pangu!
 He had already confirmed that Pangu had reincarnated.
 Han Jue was afraid of provoking him and had never created the Strength Fiendcelestial.
 Was Pangu finally going to appear after so many years?
 Seeing that the rewards were the same, Han Jue didn’t hesitate and directly chose the second option.
 He took out the Creation Spirit Stone and fused it with a ball of Fiendcelestial Qi in the Primordial World.
 Han Jue looked up into the depths of the chaos and began to search for the Strength Fiendcelestial’s aura.
  After a long while…
 He finally felt a very powerful Chaotic Fiendcelestial aura.
 This aura was especially different from ordinary living beings. It was filled with ruthlessness and caused one to feel danger.
 However, he couldn’t see the Strength Fiendcelestial’s existence. It should be hiding in a special space-time dimension.
 Han Jue retracted his gaze.
 An hour later, he opened his eyes again.
 He felt inexplicably horrified as if his natural enemy had appeared.
 This feeling was very subtle but also very accurate. It could directly tell him the reason.
 If he was already like this, the other Chaotic Fiendcelestials should feel it even more deeply.
 “I’m a Primordial Fiendcelestial. Why do I feel it, too?”
 Han Jue was surprised. Could it be that the Primordial Fiendcelestial and the Chaotic Fiendcelestial were really related by the evolution chain?
 Forget it, it’s none of my business.
 Han Jue closed his eyes again and continued cultivating.
 In the dark space, boundless mist spread. At the edge of the lake.
 Han Tuo and Yi Tian meditated and cultivated quietly.
 They suddenly opened their eyes at the same time. A terrifying aura erupted from their bodies and their faces became sinister.
 Indescribable anger erupted from their hearts like a volcano erupting. Their auras surged until their long hair fluttered like dragons and snakes.
 The two of them gasped and glared ahead.
 < After a long time, the uncontrollable anger
 dissipated.
 Yi Tian turned to look at Han Tuo and asked, “What did you feel just now?”
 Yi Tian snorted. “That’s right. Unfortunately, we’re not strong enough. We’re not even qualified.”
 He did not say anything, but Han Tuo understood.
 At this moment, a ball of demonic Qi appeared behind the two of them and transformed into the Devil Ancestor Lu Yuan.
 Lu Yuan said, “Do you feel it?”
 The two of them turned around and nodded.
 Lu Yuan said, “Pangu’s reincarnation. The previous battle of the Fiendcelestials is about to begin again.”
 Han Tuo frowned and asked, “Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity?”
 “In other words, you will be his target.
 “Me too.”
 Han Tuo and Yi Tian frowned.
 Lu Yuan said faintly, “Even the three thousand Chaotic Fiendcelestials are not Pangu’s match. There are less than a hundred now. Pangu will be invincible.”
 Han Tuo asked, “Aren’t the Great Dao Divine Spirits going to do anything?” Lu Yuan said, “They won’t. If they did, Pangu wouldn’t be so world-shattering. It might be the leader of the gods.”
 “Who is the leader of the gods?”
 “Unspeakable name.”
  Han Tuo and Yi Tian were silent.
 Han Tuo frowned. “Be it Pangu or the Primordial Fiendcelestial, the Chaos will still face the winner among them. Could it be that the Great Dao Divine Spirits expect them to both be injured? An existence like them can recover instantly even if they are severely injured. Can’t the Great Dao Divine Spirits think of this?”
 Lu Yuan said, “If we guessed this, there wouldn’t be the current situation.
 With that, the Devil Ancestor dissipated.
 Yi Tian scratched his head. “Who cares? In any case, we just have to think of a way to kill Pangu. That fellow has just been successfully nurtured. Could it be that he has invincible strength the moment he is born?”.
 Han Tuo took a deep breath and did not reply.
 Han Jue, who was cultivating, heard the Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial’s voice. It was probably about Pangu.
 Han Jue created a clone and continued cultivating
 He had to enter seclusion for at least fifty thousand years.
 Besides, he was not a true Chaotic Fiendcelestial. What did killing a Chaotic Fiendcelestial have to do with him?
 A thousand years later.
 In the Grand Primordium Domain, the Fiendcelestials gathered in the hall.
 Han Jue’s clone noticed that there were more new faces and fewer old faces.
 The Foolish Sword Sage and Red Fate were on his left and right, ten thousand feet apart.
 The atmosphere in the hall was tense. The good-natured Fiendcelestials of the ancient sects did not say a word.
 Pangu’s name was definitely a nightmare for the Chaotic Fiendcelestials, especially for the ancient Fiendcelestials.
 The Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial had a headache. Previously, it was still preparing to deal with the Dark Forbidden Lord. It did not expect Pangu to appear at this moment.
 Somehow, he felt that he was being targeted.
 A hand was approaching him.
 “Pangu has just been born. What’s there to be afraid of? As long as we don’t give him time, we can kill him as soon as possible!” the Foolish Sword Sage suddenly said with a disdainful tone.
 He despised the Chaotic Fiendcelestials present.
Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates They didn’t have the arrogance of a Chaotic Fiendcelestial at all!
 “Pangu was not born as the strongest Fiendcelestial. His reputation was earned by killing. We have already learned our lesson. Why should we be afraid of him?” the Foolish Sword Sage said proudly. He was not the least afraid.
 An ancient Fiendcelestial mocked, “If you’re so arrogant, why don’t you kill Pangu?”
 The Foolish Sword Sage smiled. “How will you thank me if I do?”
 “I will serve you as your servant!”
 “Alright!”
 The Foolish Sword Sage stood up and left.
 No Fiendcelestial stopped him.
 After he disappeared, Red Fate sent a voice transmission to Han Jue, “Aren’t you going to stop him?”
 Han Jue replied with a voice transmission, “I’m not close to him.”
 “Then, why did he sit near you twice?”
 “That’s just his wishful thinking.”
 Han Jue’s reply had a double meaning.
  Red Fate glanced at him and didn’t say anything else.
 The Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial said, “In that case, we’ll wait for Foolish Sword Sage to test Pangu’s current cultivation level.”
 The Chaotic Fiendcelestials had no objections. In any case, they hated the Foolish Sword Sage.
 The hall fell silent as the Fiendcelestials began to cultivate.
 Thousands of years later.
 They seemed to sense something and opened their eyes.
 Han Jue was the same.
 A Chaotic Fiendcelestial began to fight!
 Han Jue was secretly curious. Could the newly nurtured Pangu defeat the Foolish Sword Sage?
 According to the plan, the Foolish Sword Sage should lose. Otherwise, what would happen if Pangu died as soon as he was born?


 “Pangu is still Pangu. This aura is really unforgettable.”
 “Although I hate him, I have to say that the Great Dao of Strength is indeed powerful. Back then, the Great Dao of Heavenly Constellation was almost on par with him. Unfortunately, he still died in the hands of the Heaven-Opening Axe.”
 “If not for the Heaven-Opening Axe, the Chaotic Green Lotus, and the Chaotic Bead, how could Pangu have killed through the three thousand Fiendcelestials?”
 “Pangu is bare-handed in this life. Perhaps we have overestimated him.”
 “The Foolish Sword Sage has attacked. Eh? What a powerful sword Qi!”
 He was not a true Chaotic Fiendcelestial. He couldn’t sense the battle and could only sense the direction. He didn’t know where the two of them were hiding.
 “Why didn’t you start a live stream?”
 However, he couldn’t say it lest he exposed that he was not a Chaotic Fiendcelestial.
 Perhaps even the Chaotic Fiendcelestials could see that there was a special connection, but he could not.
 “This Pangu can’t even insta-kill the Foolish Sword Sage. He’s nothing much.”
 Han Jue thought silently.
 He actually wanted to deal with Pangu, but he knew that this Pangu was not truly resurrected. The real Pangu would still be around even if this one was destroyed.
 It was better to wait for Pangu to kill a few more Chaotic Fiendcelestials and reduce the number of opponents for him and his son. Then, he would attack and destroy Pangu with the righteousness of the Chaotic Fiendcelestials.
 He was not enemies with Pangu. He had no choice. He had to protect himself!
 An hour later.
 The hall suddenly fell silent.
 Han Jue understood that the battle was over.
 Why aren’t they saying anything? Han Jue’s clone couldn’t check his emails, so he could only be anxious.
 The Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial slowly said, “The Foolish Sword Sage was defeated. Unfortunately, he still had a chance of winning. Who knew that Pangu would have another Supreme Treasure?”
 The Fiendcelestials spoke.
 “What Supreme Treasure is that? It can actually reflect the Foolish Sword Sage’s Sword Dao.”
 “He’s indeed powerful. Pangu was pierced by the Foolish Sword Sage’s Sword Dao, but he can still kill him.”
 “The Foolish Sword Sage is impressive. Although this fellow is arrogant, his potential is indeed great. Most importantly, he doesn’t rely on his Great Dao, but his Sword Dao.”
 “His Sword Dao is not bad. I wonder how strong that opponent is?”
 Han Jue was not surprised. The Foolish Sword Sage was indeed not strong.
 He wondered if he was dead.
 Han Jue passed this matter to his main body.
 In the Daoist temple, Han Jue knew that the Foolish Sword God Sage had lost, but he didn’t open his eyes and continued cultivating.
 Han Jue checked his emails and found emails about the Foolish Sword Sage.
 (Your good friend Foolish Sword Sage was attacked by your enemy Pangu.]
 (Your good friend Foolish Sword Sage was attacked by a mysterious force. His soul is in a daze.]
 (Your good friend Foolish Sword Sage was attacked by your enemy Pangu. He was severely injured and his body was destroyed.]
 (Your good friend Foolish Sword Sage was saved by a mysterious mighty figure. His soul escaped.)
 Eh?
 A third party interfered?
 Han Jue asked in his mind, “Who attacked the Foolish Sword Sage when he fought Pangu, causing his soul to be in a daze?”
 (500 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 A figure appeared in Han Jue’s mind and a notification appeared in front of him.
 (Holy Mother of Order: Late-stage Great Dao Supreme Realm, Great Dao Divine Spirit]
 It was her!
 Han Jue narrowed his eyes. He would never forget how the Holy Mother of Order broke the Heavenly Dao the moment she attacked.
 He continued to ask, “Who saved the Foolish Sword Sage?”
 [900 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 (Laozi: Perfected Great Dao Supreme Realm, Transcendent Dao Expert, Pangu’s Essence Soul, personal disciple of the Dao Ancestor, creator of the Sword Dao, ancestor of the Hundred Schools, Immeasurable Emperor, ancestor of the Human School, founder of the Great Dao]
 Eh?
 Pangu’s essence soul helped the Foolish Sword Sage deal with Pangu?
 Interesting!
 In that case, the Dao Sects and Pangu might not be on good terms.
 Then, let them fight!
 Han Jue smiled.
 The thought of fighting Pangu made him inexplicably excited.
 He began the simulation trial and fought against five thousand Foolish Sword Sages.
 After repeating it hundreds of times, Han Jue’s excitement subsided.
 He couldn’t defeat five thousand Foolish Sword Sages.
 The Foolish Sword Sage couldn’t defeat Pangu.
 Yeah.
 He deduced that he couldn’t defeat Pangu, so he could not be rash.
 Han Jue prepared to continue cultivating.
 His strength would definitely increase greatly again when he reached the perfected Great Dao Primordial Chaos Realm. At that time, Pangu would be nothing!
 One day, he would fight ten thousand Pangu in the simulation trial!
 At this moment…
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du’s voice floated into his ears. It was really time.
 Han Jue stood up and came to the Universal Hall.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du immediately summoned the other Sages.
 All the Sages arrived in less than five minutes.
 South Extreme Heavenly Venerate, Sect Master Tian Jue, Emperor Xiao, Heavenly Venerate Wufa, Qiu Xilai, Fang Liang, Jin Shen, Pan Xin, Xu Dudao, Su Qi, Li Taigu, Primordial Chaos Buddha, Zhang Guxing, Long Hao, Ji Xianshen, Divine Might Buddha, and Yang Che all arrived.
 Including Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du, the Heavenly Dao already had 21 Heavenly Dao Sages. It was obvious how much stronger they were than before.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “Pangu has revived!”
 The hall was shocked!
 Who was Pangu?
 The founder of the Heavenly Dao!
 It was not an exaggeration to say that he was their ancestor!
 The Sages were moved. They suddenly remembered that Han Jue was also a Chaotic Fiendcelestial. This matter had already spread in the Chaos.
 Didn’t that mean that Pangu would also kill him?
 But… That was Pangu!
 Helping Han Jue meant killing Pangu!
 This was a betrayal!
 Han Yu’s expression was also ugly. He did not expect to face such a thing as soon as he became a Sage.
  He looked at his father and saw that his expression was normal and he didn’t feel any pressure.
 That was Giant God Pangu!
 In the Heavenly Dao, Pangu was a Creation God!
 The older the faith of all living beings, the stronger they became. How could Han Jue be Pangu’s match?
 Pan Xin snorted. “Although I’m Pangu’s descendent, I support Fellow Daoist Han. Now, we’re Heavenly Dao Sages. If anything happens to Fellow Daoist Han, the Heavenly Dao will definitely be devoured by the Chaos. Do you think Pangu will protect the Heavenly Dao in the future?”
 “He sent you a dream?”
 The Sages were surprised. They didn’t expect the first to support Han Jue to be Pan Xin, a descendant of Pangu!
 The Sages had even stranger expressions.
 Qiu Xilai, who had always been afraid of death and loved to scheme, also chose to support Han Jue at this juncture and not go against Pangu?


 Pan Xin and Qiu Xilai had already spoken. The other Sages naturally did not dare to remain silent. They all swore that they would protect the Heavenly Dao and fight Pangu!
 Han Jue was not touched. Under such circumstances, only a fool would jump out to support Pangu.
 “It’s better for us to explain clearly than to be used by the enemy. The current Heavenly Dao travels the Chaos. It’s very difficult to directly control the hearts of all living beings. We can only use emotions and logic.”
 The Sages nodded and felt that it made sense.
 They were also cultivators. The more they suppressed some things and hid them, the more rebellious they became.
 Han Jue said, “How can I be confident when facing Pangu? All I can say is that I’ll try my best.”
 The old Sages smiled, and the new Sages had solemn expressions.
  Only those who were familiar with Han Jue knew his personality.
 He would have run away long ago if he couldn’t win.
 Han Jue was still so calm. It was not because he was confident, but because he was extremely confident.
 Doing his best was already Han Jue’s greatest arrogance!
 The Sages nodded.
 Then, Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du began to talk about some development of the Heavenly Dao. Han Jue was bored and opened the emails to kill time.
 Two hours later.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du talked about the Three Pure Sacred World.
 “The Three Pure Sacred World has recruited cultivators of the Dao Sect ever since its establishment. It can be considered to have regained the Dao Ancestor’s lineage and has the momentum to strengthen the Dao Sect. Pangu swept through the Chaos, and the one who benefited the most was probably the Dao Sect.
 “The Three Pure Sacred World is not too far from the Heavenly Dao. It’s near the original Deity Realm of the Ruins of End. They are all under the jurisdiction of the Divine Robe Daoist.
 The Sages fell into deep thought.
 The strongest in the Heavenly Dao was Han Jue. With Great Sage Void Soul, there were only two Great Dao Sages.
 Laozi, the Heavenly Lord of Primordial Beginning, the Heavenly Sect Master, and their personal disciples were all Great Dao Sages.
 The Sages did not know that Laozi was not a Great Dao Sage either, but an existence that surpassed one.
 Fang Liang said, “The Chaos is vast. Even if the Heavenly Dao and the Three Pure Sacred World develop extremely quickly, it still needs a hundred million years to border us. Only then will there be a conflict of benefits. A hundred million years is enough for the Heavenly Dao to give birth to many mighty figures. No matter how strong the Three Pure Sacred World is, it’s not formed by Pangu sacrificing his cultivation at his peak. The great creation of the Heavenly Dao is the greatest in the Chaos.”
 Why was the providence of the Heavenly Dao so strong? It always gave birth to mighty figures. Wasn’t it because Pangu was already the strongest in the Chaos when he was created?
 The strongest existence in the Chaos sacrificed himself to create a world. It was naturally the strongest in the Chaos. Furthermore, it was the world with the oldest lifespan. It was just that it had been suppressed by the Dao Ancestor for a long time.
 The Sages smiled confidently.
 “From today onwards, all Sages must often open their Dao Field and preach the Dao to all living beings. After the calamity ends, we will strive for the number of Sages to reach a hundred!” Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du explained the next Heavenly Dao plan firmly. The Sages were excited.
 This was a boat. When everyone advanced, the people in front would naturally benefit more.
 The more new Sages there were, the more Freedom Sages there would be. The more Freedom Sages there were, the more Great Dao Sages there would be born!
 1
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du arranged some more things and then let the Sages disperse.
  Han Jue also stood up and left.
 In two steps, he vanished without a trace.
 The new Sages secretly admired him. Han Jue didn’t frown even when facing a great enemy like Pangu. Was this the Divine Might Heavenly Sage?
 In his eyes, what kind of existence was Pangu?
 In the Grand Primordium Domain, dozens of Chaotic Fiendcelestials were still meditating in the hall. Han Jue’s clone was still there.
 The Chaotic Fiendcelestials would begin to discuss every thousand years.
 Pangu was frantically chasing after the wandering Fiendcelestials who had not entered the Fiendcelestial Race and killed them all.
 Every time a Fiendcelestial died, their providence would transfer to Pangu’s body, causing his cultivation level to increase greatly!
 The battle of the Fiendcelestials before the creation of the world repeated!
 Han Jue’s clone was also here. Hearing the Fiendcelestials’ emotions, he secretly despised them.
 He wanted to fight Pangu!
 The Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial also had ambitions. He had always thought that he was not inferior to Pangu, but due to heavenly providence, Pangu had three Birth Supreme Treasures and they were all Supreme Treasures that matched the Great Dao of Strength. He only had one Supreme Treasure at the beginning, so how could he defeat him?
 Han Jue sent a voice transmission, “I’m hiding in the Heavenly Dao. I’m also a descendant of Pangu. He will only leave me behind.”
 Red Fate was silent. That made sense.
 At this moment, a Fiendcelestial exclaimed, “The Foolish Sword Sage isn’t dead? He actually went to challenge Pangu again!”
 The other Fiendcelestials spoke.
 “Previously, he was not Pangu’s match. Now, Pangu is several times stronger. How dare he!”
 “This fellow is impressive. No wonder he dared to challenge Pangu back then.”
 “Unfortunately, Pangu is too strong.”
 “Why do I feel that something is wrong? Pangu seems to have someone helping him?”
 The Fiendcelestials quickly saw the problem. Every time the Foolish Sword Sage injured Pangu, he would always recover. Most importantly, his blood essence would not decrease.
 Pangu was only a Strength Fiendcelestial and had not grasped any other Great Dao. What right did he have to face existences of the same level without dying and maintaining his full strength?
 Han Jue thought to himself, “You finally see through it!”
  Pangu had the support of the Holy Mother of Order. Han Jue felt that there must be other transcendent existences behind him.
 There were also many Chaotic Fiendcelestials in Life!
 Several hours later.
 The Foolish Sword Sage was defeated again, but this time, he relied on his own methods to escape.
 The Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial suddenly opened his eyes and said, “We can’t wait for death. It’s time for us to attack!”
 He slowly stood up and said in a loud voice, “Everyone, follow me to fight Pangu!”
 With that said, all the Fiendcelestials stood up.
 They were just waiting for this sentence!


 “Those who only have their clones here, send your main bodies immediately. Kill Pangu in one battle and let him know that his era has passed!”
 The Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial scanned all the Fiendcelestials and said seriously.
 Han Jue felt that this fellow was talking about him.
 In this palace, only a few Chaotic Fiendcelestials had sent clones. The others were all their main bodies. They were also afraid that their main bodies would be killed by Pangu if they stayed in their hometown.
 Just like that, the Fiendcelestials flew out of the palace under the Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial’s lead.
 Han Jue would take advantage of the situation to see Pangu’s strength.
 Ten thousand years later.
 Han Jue came to the second Dao Field and released the Thunderbolt Fiendcelestial to let Murong Qi receive him.
  Han Jue looked at the second Dao Field after the two of them left.
 “All these years, the Fiendcelestials have been very impatient. They all feel Pangu’s threat,” Li Yao said softly.
 She also felt it. Not only that, but Pangu’s name burst out from her bloodline and surged into her mind, letting her know the reason.
 Han Jue asked, “Has it been soothed?”
 Li Yao nodded. “It’s all thanks to Murong Qi. I have to say that your grand-disciple is indeed very talented.”
 Han Jue smiled. Of course. He valued Murong Qi the most!
 Dao Comprehension Sword asked, “Master, will Pangu find us?”
 Han Jue said, “Yes, but he can’t enter.”
 Pangu clearly had the ability to track the Fiendcelestials. He could sense its direction even if he couldn’t spy on the second Dao Field. This was a resonance between the Fiendcelestials.
 Dao Comprehension Sword was curious. She was already curious about the array formation of the Dao Field, but she did not dare to ask.
 Li Yao smiled. “Don’t worry. Even if the sky falls, Sect Master will hold it up. Pangu is not our enemy. Our enemy is still in the future.”
 Most of the Fiendcelestials had already entered the Sage Realm, but they had yet to reach the Freedom Realm.
 “That’s right. You have to at least reach the Great Dao Sage Realm before you can serve me.” Han Jue smiled. Unfortunately, he didn’t have a beard. Otherwise, it would be so cool to stroke it and smile.
 Of course, he could also grow a beard himself.
 He checked the emails.
 (Your son Han Tuo has stepped into the Freedom Primordial Chaos Realm. His cultivation has increased greatly.)
 (Your good friend Yi Tian has stepped into the Freedom Primordial Chaos Realm. His cultivation has increased greatly.)
 (Your disciple Dao Sovereign has entered the Chaotic Fiendcelestial’s corpse.]
 (Your disciple Zhao Xuanyuan has entered…]
 as
 [Your good friend Divine Robe Daoist was cursed by a mysterious curse.]
 [Your enemy Seven Dao Sage has successfully revived.)
 (Your good friend Foolish Sword Sage has fused his Great Dao with the Sword Dao and successfully stepped into the Great Dao Supreme Realm.)
 Was this considered rebuilding after destruction?
 Han Jue couldn’t help but sigh. This fellow was indeed powerful.
 Han Tuo and Yi Tian were also considered people with great providence. They had reached the Freedom Realm so quickly and were even stronger than his disciples.
 No wonder most cultivators risked their lives to seek opportunities.
 Han Jue also noticed that Seven Dao Sage had revived.
 Seven Dao Sage was no longer anything in his eyes. If he knew his place, Han Jue wouldn’t care about him for the time being.
 But he would be insta-killed if he still dared to act recklessly.
 Unlike Sages, Great Dao Sages were really difficult to nurture.
 Han Jue continued reading the emails.
 Pangu’s appearance caused his friends to settle down. They rarely encountered a series of beatings.
 It had to be said that Pangu was ferocious. His influence could be said to be the number one in history.
 After reading the emails, Han Jue switched his consciousness to his clone. At this moment, his clone was still following the Fiendcelestials through the Chaos.
 The Chaos was endless. It would take time to find Pangu. Furthermore, this fellow seemed to be deliberately hiding. It might be related to the battle that had just ended.
 (Foolish Sword Sage sent you a dream. Do you accept?]
 Han Jue’s thoughts were interrupted by the notification.
 He hesitated for a moment and then asked in his mind, “Will it be dangerous for me to accept the Foolish Sword Sage’s dream?”
 After all, this fellow was already the Great Dao Supreme. He was no longer the same as before.

 [No]
 Han Jue chose to accept the dream.
 The dream was a Primordial Void, the place where the two of them fought.
 The Foolish Sword Sage looked no different from before, but his entire body had already transformed. Countless sword shadows were interwoven in his eyes.
 Han Jue said, “Then, you’re really powerful.”
 The Foolish Sword Sage said, “Don’t fight with Pangu. He has a mighty figure behind him. It’s impossible to defeat him. Pangu’s revival this time is only to restore the Chaotic Order. Perhaps it’s for the Primordial Fiendcelestial. After all, in the chaotic situation, it’s easier for the Primordial Fiendcelestial to grow.”
 Han Jue said helplessly, “I don’t want to fight with him either, but can I make the decision?”
 “Perhaps, as long as it’s the Heavenly Dao’s rules.”
 “You survived? Pangu won’t find trouble with you anymore?”
 “Yes, I’ve already fought him twice. It can be considered as proving myself. He promised not to look for me again as long as I don’t stop him.”
 Han Jue fell into deep thought.
 Pangu was actually a pawn.
 The Foolish Sword Sage said, “Divine Might Heavenly Sage, I look forward to defeating you openly. Don’t die.”
 With that, the dream shattered.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and asked in his mind, “I want to know who the greatest backer behind Pangu’s operation is?”

 (Chaos Consciousness: Cultivation unknown, Chaotic Deity, Above the Great Dao, Rules and Order, Unspeakable Name.)
 Indeed, it’s him!
 Han Jue’s heart sank.
 The strongest existence he knew!
 There were not many providence labels, but each was extremely important.
 Han Jue asked in his mind, “Will the Chaotic Consciousness attack me if I defeat Pangu?”
 (1 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]

 [Not for the time being, but it will pay attention to you.]
 Attention?
 Han Jue suddenly thought of something and his expression became strange.
 I see!
 The Chaotic Consciousness guessed that there might be a Primordial Fiendcelestial among the Chaotic Fiendcelestials, so it was using Pangu to test the waters?
  This fellow’s goal was not to clean up the Chaos but to find the Primordial Fiendcelestial.
 Who else could defeat the strongest Chaotic Fiendcelestial apart from the Primordial Fiendcelestial?
 Han Jue was in a dilemma.
 Didn’t this mean that he couldn’t attack Pangu? Even with the protection of the Dao Field, it would be troublesome once his identity was exposed. The entire Chaos would target his Dao Field and his disciples, friends, and descendants.
 Perhaps Han Jue could move all of them into the Dao Field, but wouldn’t that be imprisoning them?
 Han Jue took out the Book of Misfortune.
 I can only rely on you now.
 Han Jue touched the Book of Misfortune and sighed.
 I didn’t expect that I would still have to rely on you today.
 You’re really my treasure!
