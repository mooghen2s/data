 Such concealment probably did not entail good intentions.
 Han Jue had already detected his information.
 (Cave Master Clear Wind: Early-stage Great Dao Primordial Chaos Realm, Connate lifeform, disciple of the Dao Ancestor, Immeasurable Emperor]
 Cave Master Clear Wind?
  What a strange name! Cave Master Clear Wind smiled and replied, “I’m only a Daoist wandering in the Chaos. This time, I’m here to see how the old place is developing. You must be the Divine Might Heavenly Sage of the Heavenly Dao. Impressive. The Heavenly Dao is developing very well in your hands. It can be considered an unprecedented golden age.”
 Han Jue asked, “You already saw it. What’s next?”
 A Great Dao Sage was extremely dangerous to the Heavenly Dao. Han Jue had to be wary. He would kill him instantly if this fellow dared to develop hatred towards him!
 “Of course. You’re really wary. Perhaps this is the reason why the Heavenly Dao can develop until now.”
 Cave Master Clear Wind sighed. He had the bearing of an expert.
 Although he kept calling him a fellow Daoist, Han Jue felt that this old fellow’s tone like he was talking to a junior.
 In terms of age, Han Jue was a junior.
 But not in terms of cultivation!
 Cultivation was used to determine seniority in the Chaos!
 Cave Master Clear Wind suddenly asked, “What do you think of the Dao Ancestor?”
 Han Jue replied, “The Dao Ancestor has endless merit towards the Heavenly Dao. He is the ancestor of the Heavenly Dao cultivators. I naturally respect him.”
 (Cave Master Clear Wind has developed hatred towards you. Current Hatred Points: 1 star.]
 Han Jue narrowed his eyes. What did he mean?
 Aren’t you the disciple of the Dao Ancestor?
 You want to betray your master?
 Han Jue almost attacked him when he saw the hatred notification. Fortunately, it was a one-star hatred. Otherwise, the ashes of Cave Master Clear Wind would have been scattered on the Chaotic Heavenly Road.
 “Looks like the Dao Ancestor’s wish has been fulfilled.”
 Cave Master Clear Wind sighed and left.
 Watching him leave, Han Jue still endured it.
 One-star Hatred Points showed that the other party was only unhappy. There was no need to curse or kill.
 Han Jue didn’t want to develop a bloodthirsty personality.
 Then why was he staring at the Chaotic Heavenly Road instead of the Heavenly Dao?
 It looked like he was checking something.
 Most importantly, this fellow did not even dare to leave behind his Dao title. Was he afraid of being cursed?
 Han Jue had no choice but to use the derivation function. “I want to know why Cave Master Clear Wind came to the Heavenly Dao?”
 (160 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 Han Jue entered the illusion.
 He opened his eyes and appeared in a dark world. The barren land was continuous in all directions. He could only see very short weeds and various flames floating in the air. He couldn’t see any living beings.
 His gaze landed on a stone tablet.
 This stone tablet was a thousand feet tall. Its surface was covered in cracks and was very inconspicuous in the vast world.
 Han Jue noticed a few words on the stone tablet, but he couldn’t see them clearly.
 Strange.
 There were still things that the Great Dao Sages could not see clearly?
 There must be a special restriction on the stone tablet.
 At this moment, figures appeared in front of the stone tablet. There were a total of nine figures. They were all Daoists, and one of them was none other than Cave Master Clear Wind. The leader was a tall Daoist with a jade staff at his waist that reflected a faint light.
 The tall Daoist asked, “Why did you gather us?”
 A vast voice came from the stone tablet, “The Heavenly Dao has changed. Fate is unfathomable. I need you to investigate why it has changed.”
 The nine Daoists looked at each other.
 One of the Daoists couldn’t help but say, “It’s just an investigation. Is there a need to ask all of us to go?” The other Daoists nodded.
 The Heavenly Dao was far away. They still had to cultivate.
 “Go. It’s best to think of a way to infiltrate the Heavenly Dao. This matter might involve the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity. That mysterious and unknown Primordial Fiendcelestial might be born in the Heavenly Dao in the future. If that’s the case, you can keep an eye on it immediately.” The vast voice weakened as it spoke.
 The tall Daoist frowned. Their expressions changed when the other Daoists heard about the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity.
 The illusion shattered.
 Han Jue opened his eyes. Indeed, they had ill intentions.
 He asked in his mind, “Have these nine Great Dao Sages already infiltrated the Heavenly Dao?”
 The Great Dao Sages had many methods and did not need him to infiltrate. (200 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [Not for the time being.]
 Han Jue asked, “Who was the voice in the stone tablet just now?”
 (500 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 (Beginning Deity: Late-stage Great Dao Supreme Realm, the first Great Dao Deity in the Chaos. He once fought with the Dao Ancestor and was severely injured. He was sealed in the Ancient Desolate.]
 Even though he was severely injured, he was still at the late-stage Great Dao Supreme Realm!
 The Dao Ancestor was very powerful!
 Han Jue suddenly wondered if the system could derive the Dao Ancestor?
 “I want to know where the Dao Ancestor is?”
 [The other party’s karma is too scattered and cannot be accurately deduced.)
 What did this mean?
 Could it be that the Dao Ancestor had transformed into all things, and all things were covered in chaos?
 Han Jue frowned. He had always been afraid of the Dao Ancestor.
 The Dao Ancestor always seemed to be able to escape the system’s pursuit.
 Most importantly, why did the Dao Ancestor disappear? Who was he hiding from?
 He couldn’t be hiding from Han Jue, the Primordial Fiendcelestial, right?
 Han Jue would have died thousands of times if the Dao Ancestor was still around and wanted to kill the Primordial Fiendcelestial.
 Han Jue always thought that the Dao Ancestor had chosen him as a variable and would definitely see that he was extraordinary. It was very likely because of the system.
 The original Han Jue was nothing special.
 Transmigrator?
 When Han Jue observed the myriad worlds in the universe, he often saw transmigrators whose souls traveled to other worlds.
 The so-called transmigrator was just a soul that luckily escaped the order of reincarnation and was swept into an unknown world. Speaking of which, many mighty figures also liked to transmigrate.
 Han Jue couldn’t figure it out and stopped thinking about it.
 Continue cultivating.
 He had plenty of ways to eliminate them even if the nine Great Dao Sages infiltrated the Heavenly Dao.
 If there was no other way, he could only let the Dark Forbidden Lord appear.
 Outside the 33rd Heaven.
  In the Universal Hall.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du, Sect Master Tian Jue, Qiu Xilai, Fang Liang, and Zhang Guxing gathered here.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du scanned the four Sages and said, “Today, I summon the four of you because I have a mission for you.”
 Sect Master Tian Jue replied, “Go ahead.”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “Recently, there have been rumors in the Chaos that the Primordial Fiendcelestial who is going to usher the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity will be born in the Heavenly Dao. This is probably a conspiracy. The Buddhist Sect, the Heavenly Dao Sect, the Divine Palace, and the Jie School are all sects where the geniuses of the Heavenly Dao gather. I have also informed Li Xuan’ao. Everyone, spread a statement. It’s best to push this matter into the Chaos.
 “This saying is that the Heavenly Dao will give birth to ten geniuses who can resist the Primordial Fiendcelestial. They are the Primordial Ten Sages chosen by the Dao Ancestor.”
 The four Sages were stunned.
 Fang Liang’s eyes widened. “Really?” His soul had transmigrated to the Primordial Era many times. Why had he never heard of the Primordial Ten Sages?


 The Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity was a shadow that enveloped the entire Chaos.
 “We can’t rely on Fellow Daoist Han for everything. Other than strength, there are many other ways to resolve the calamity.”
 The four Sages were silent.
  Fang Liang cursed silently, I knew it.
 What Primordial Ten Sages? It only sounded nice.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du continued, “I’ll tell you the legend of the Primordial Ten Sages now. Remember it well.”
 The four Sages had strange expressions. You even made up a legend?
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du did not seem to see their expressions and continued speaking.
 Less than five thousand years later, the legend of the Primordial Ten Sages spread in the Heavenly Dao and then from the Chaotic Heavenly Road to the Chaos.
 Legend had it that the Primordial Ten Sages were the ten mighty figures, including the Dao Ancestor. They had subdued the reincarnated Luo Hou of the Primordial Fiendcelestial and disappeared without a trace. Before the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity, they would reincarnate and cultivate the Great Dao again. They would be the saviors, killing the Primordial Fiendcelestial.
 This legend excited countless geniuses.
 The geniuses all thought highly of themselves. Tracing their talent would create a fantasy.
 Could they be the reincarnation of a mighty figure?
 The Heavenly Dao had already formed the momentum to find the Primordial Ten Sages, but it still required a long time to spread to every corner of the Chaos.
 More than ten thousand years later, Han Jue was still cultivating.
 [Detected that you are 800,000 years old. You have the following choices:)
 (1: Exit seclusion immediately. Raise the reputation of the Primordial Fiendcelestial and stir up the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity. You can obtain a chance to upgrade the Dao Field.)
 [2: Cultivate in a low-profile manner and stay away from trouble. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment, a Creation Spirit Stone, and a Supreme Treasure.]
 Eight hundred thousand years old!
 How old.
 Han Jue ignored the system’s trap and silently chose the second option.
 (Congratulations on obtaining the Ultimate Supreme Treasure—Mystical Destiny Book]
 [Mystical Destiny Book: Ultimate Supreme Treasure, a Supreme Treasure formed by seizing a supreme creation. It can tamper with the past and future of others and directly change everything. It is not restricted or spied on by any rules, but it cannot erase the existence of the Great Dao and its rules. Every time you use this treasure, your lifespan will be deducted at an equivalent price. This treasure will be unusable for a period of time. As the number of times it is used increases, its cooldown time will increase exponentially. Special hint: This treasure cannot be upgraded and cannot recognize a master.]
 What the heck!
 Han Jue blinked.
 Ultimate Supreme Treasure…
 Did he obtain a golden legendary treasure?
 Han Jue carefully checked the treasure’s introduction, and his breathing quickened
 He could directly change everything!
 Too arrogant!
 Han Jue took out the Mystical Destiny Book, and a white cover book appeared in his hand. It was smooth and cold.
 “This thing is not easy to use. I don’t know how much lifespan I have to use. Don’t suck me dry.”
 Han Jue frowned.
 [The system can help you use this treasure. This treasure is one of the strongest Supreme Treasures contained in the system. You have to be extremely cautious when using it.]
 Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief upon seeing this line of words.
 One of the strongest Supreme Treasures?
 One of?
 Changing everything directly was invincible in Han Jue’s opinion.
 (Warning. You cannot withstand the immense creation brought by this change. You will immediately die.)
 That’s not right.
 How can I die if I’m already the strongest?
 So it was useless.
 It was even more useless than the Book of Misfortune!
 Han Jue suddenly thought of how the Beginning Deity had sent the Great Dao Sages to the Heavenly Dao to investigate the Primordial Fiendcelestial.
 Can I use a fake identity so that all living beings will never think that I am a Primordial Fiendcelestial?
 Han Jue’s heart beat faster.
 This was a good idea!
 After all, the Primordial Fiendcelestial was the entire Chaos’ public enemy! “I want the living beings of the Chaos to think that I’m absolutely harmless!”
 (Warning. You cannot withstand the immense creation brought by this change. You will immediately die.]
 “I want the Chaotic Deities to have a favorable impression of me.”
 [Warning. You cannot withstand the immense creation brought by this change. You will immediately die.)
 Alright, alright!
 “I want all the living beings in the Chaos to believe that I’m the reincarnation of a Chaotic Fiendcelestial.”
 The Chaotic Fiendcelestial was already the lowest threshold. The potential Han Jue displayed was too terrifying. It was too ridiculous to say that his potential was lower than that of a Chaotic Fiendcelestial. It didn’t make sense.
 Ordinary living beings might not realize this blind spot, but Han Jue felt that with the Chaotic Deities’ existence, they would definitely notice this and continue to investigate. In the end, it would speed up the exposure of his Primordial Fiendcelestial identity.
 (Half of your lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?)
 Half?
 Han Jue’s eyes widened and he almost threw the book to the ground.
 It was indeed not a good thing!
 However, Han Jue still didn’t give up.
 His lifespan would be refreshed as long as he broke through. He had to protect the Primordial Fiendcelestial’s secrets first.
 Han Jue gritted his teeth and chose to continue.
 The Mystical Destiny Book emitted a dazzling light. Han Jue felt a terrifying suction force pulling something out of him.
 It was his lifespan!
 Han Jue came back to his senses after an unknown period of time. Unprecedented exhaustion surged into his heart.
 A hint of fear appeared in his eyes as he looked at the Mystical Destiny Book again.
 This thing was too terrifying. Putting aside the price, just the ability was very addictive.
 Han Jue checked the book’s cooldown time.
 “Ten million years?”
 Han Jue was stunned.
 He didn’t know if he should be happy or disappointed.
 He was happy that he would not be addicted but disappointed that such a Supreme Treasure had a long cooldown time.
 The cooldown time would increase exponentially after each use.
 Wouldn’t he have to wait for a hundred million years or even longer after using it a second time?
 Han Jue put away the Mystical Destiny Book, and his Sage Sense swept through the Heavenly Dao.
 All living beings did not change. Everything was as before.
 Was this a change?
 Han Jue suddenly thought of something. “Do the Chaotic Deities have a similar Supreme Treasure?”
  (Ultimate Supreme Treasure cannot be deduced.]
 He thought of a voice he had heard a long time ago.
 Transcend the illusion… It would indeed be a lie if everything could be changed. What was a real existence that could not be altered?
 Han Jue adjusted his state of mind.
 Using the Mystical Destiny Book to kill enemies might not be as worth it as the Book of Misfortune. It was better to do it himself.
 If this treasure fell into the hands of other living beings and their cultivation levels stagnated, the user would probably die after using it two or three times.


 Nine Daoists meditating were on this island. Among them was Cave Master Clear Wind who had gone to the Heavenly Dao previously.
 Cave Master Clear Wind opened his eyes and said, “Everyone, we should leave. There’s no point in staying in the Heavenly Dao.”
 The other Daoists opened their eyes.
 “Yes! This Chaotic Fiendcelestial defeated two Great Dao Divine Spirits in a row and even killed fourteen Great Dao Sages. He can be said to be the strongest Chaotic Fiendcelestial.”
  “Then, let’s go. We can open our own Dao Field. There’s no need to return to the Ancient Desolate.”
 “That’s right. The Beginning Deity was frightened by the Dao Ancestor and was too cautious. Aren’t we his pawns? The pawns he used to test the Heavenly Dao.”
 “Will the Beginning Deity be offended?” “What are you afraid of! The Dao Ancestor is only missing, not dead. The Beginning Deity probably doesn’t dare to escape the Ancient Desolate.”
 The Daoists talked to each other and had the same opinion. They all wanted to leave.
 Han Jue’s achievements were too impressive. To be honest, they didn’t dare to provoke him at all. This was also the reason why they didn’t dare to infiltrate the Heavenly Dao.
 The tall Daoist in the lead stared at Cave Master Clear Wind and asked, “Tell me what you think of that Chaotic Fiendcelestial.”
 Cave Master Clear Wind said, “This person is ruthless, but he doesn’t like to kill. He has a strong hostility towards the Chaos. I was chased away by him not long after I went there. In addition, he is filled with reverence for the Dao Ancestor. This means that there is another possibility. The Dao Ancestor is his backing.
 “During this period of time, I’ve been recruiting Heavenly Dao cultivators to understand the development of the Heavenly Dao in the past million years. After discovering that the Dao Ancestor had gone missing, the Heavenly Dao began to collapse and was played by the Dark Forbidden Lord until the Divine Might Heavenly Sage rose. This Chaotic Fiendcelestial was probably sent by the Dao Ancestor to protect the Heavenly Dao.
 “Once we infiltrate, we might not only offend the Divine Might Heavenly Sage but also the Dao Ancestor.”
 The tall Daoist’s expression changed.
 After a long while…
 He said, “Alright, then let us retreat. We of the Purple Firmament Nine Daoists are not the deities’ lackeys. There’s no need to die for them.”
 The other Sages were relieved.
 They immediately left.
 Han Jue had been cultivating with all his might ever since he used the Mystical Destiny Book, fighting to regain his lost lifespan.
 The lifespan deduction would be nothing as long as he broke through.
 Time flew.
 Another hundred thousand years passed.
 [Detected that you are 900,000 years old and your life has taken another step forward. You have the following choices:]
 [1: Exit seclusion immediately. Raise the reputation of the Primordial Fiendcelestial and stir up the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity. You can obtain a chance to upgrade the Dao Field.)
 [2: Cultivate in a low-profile manner and stay away from trouble. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment, a Creation Spirit Stone, and a Supreme Treasure.]
 The first option was to upgrade the Dao Field just like when he reached 800,000 years of age.
 Han Jue had already used his lifespan to make all living beings think that he was a Chaotic Fiendcelestial. How could he go out and spread the name of the Primordial Fiendcelestial?
 He silently chose the second option.
 Could there be another impressive Supreme Treasure this time?
 (Congratulations on obtaining the Chaotic Supreme Treasure-World Visualization Heart Bracelet]
 (World Visualization Heart Bracelet: Chaotic Supreme Treasure. When the Chiliocosm World appeared in the Chaos, it was born as a Supreme Treasure. It is a providence Supreme Treasure formed by the gathering of the power of the world. It can resist Great Dao attacks.]
 Another defensive Supreme Treasure?
 Han Jue was not surprised or disappointed.
 He immediately took out the World Visualization Heart Bracelet and started refining it.
 There were a total of 18 beads on the World Visualization Heart Bracelet. Their colors were all different and they were tightly connected into a circle.
 Eighty years later, the refinement was successful.
 The eighteen beads dispersed and flew quickly. They surrounded Han Jue, sometimes connecting into a circle and sometimes scattering into other patterns as if symbolizing the evolution of the world.
 Han Jue took out the Creation Spirit Stone and chose a ball of Fiendcelestial Qi to fuse with.
 Then, he came to the second Dao Field and released the Weak Water Fiendcelestial created by the Creation Spirit Stone a hundred thousand years ago to let Murong Qi fetch it. Dao Comprehension Sword looked at him and asked curiously, “Why can you constantly create Chaotic Fiendcelestials?”
 Han Jue glanced at her and didn’t say anything.
 Li Yao said, “Don’t ask what you shouldn’t
 ask.”
 Han Jue said, “That’s right. Knowing too much is not good for you. Sometimes, even if you don’t want to say it, those transcendent existences can capture the memories in your mind. You don’t want to be forced to betray me in the future, right?”
 Dao Comprehension Sword hurriedly shook her head.
 Han Jue smiled and returned to the main Dao Field.
 Dao Comprehension Sword clicked her tongue in wonder. “Master has another Supreme Treasure on him. I wonder where he obtained it. Doesn’t he stay inside all the time?”
 The World Visualization Heart Bracelet was clearly extraordinary.
 Li Yao said calmly, “It’s just that you think he doesn’t want to go out. An existence like him doesn’t have to do it personally. He can directly enter the Chaos and have many methods to find Dharma treasures.”
 Dao Comprehension Sword felt that it made sense.
 Han Jue suddenly thought of something as he sat on the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus.
 It was useless to leave his previous Dharma treasures in the system space. It was better to give them to his disciples.
 Yes, he would give it to them in the future.
 Han Jue closed his eyes and continued cultivating.
 He began to look forward to the reward.
 Year after year passed.
 Seventy thousand years passed in the blink of an eye.
 Han Jue opened his eyes. His Sage Sense swept through the 33rd Heaven and he sensed no aura of a powerful enemy.
 He followed them to the Universal Hall.
 As usual, after Han Jue arrived, Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du sent a voice transmission to the other Heavenly Dao Sages.
 South Extreme Heavenly Venerate, Sect Master Tian Jue, Emperor Xiao, Heavenly Venerate Wufa, Qiu Xilai, Fang Liang, Huang Zuntian, Jin Shen, Pan Xin, Xu Dudao, Su Qi, Li Taigu, Primordial Chaos Buddha, Zhang Guxing, and Long Hao arrived one after another.
 “First, the Heavenly Dao has another Sage position. What do you think?” Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du asked.
 Han Jue opened the emails.
 (Your good friend Divine Lord Peacock was attacked by your enemy, the Curse Fiendcelestial.]
 (Your son Han Tuo has grasped a Chaotic Divine Armament. His providence has increased greatly.]
  [Your grand-disciple Chu Shiren has stepped into the Chaotic River of Destiny. His providence has increased greatly.)
 (Your descendant Han Yu was cursed by a mysterious curse.]
 (Your good friend Huang Zuntian transmigrated and was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure. He was severely injured.]
 (Your good friend Evil Heavenly Emperor was cursed by a mysterious curse.]
 (Your enemy, the First Life Black Sovereign, has cultivated a Karma Mystical Power.]
 Han Jue glanced at Huang Zuntian. This fellow didn’t look to have been severely injured.
 Instead, Pan Xin looked distracted.
 Looking down, could it be that the reason why the First Life Black Sovereign learned the Karma Mystical Power was to avoid the curse?


 Clearly, there was more or less the suspicion of flattery.
 Speaking of which, Han Jue hadn’t paid attention to this disciple for a long time.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said again, “Next, let’s talk about the Primordial Ten Sages. This legend can’t convince the Chaos. We need to choose ten geniuses who can represent the Heavenly Dao to make a name for themselves. They can’t be Sages.”
 Primordial Ten Sages?
  Han Jue deduced silently and didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du really knew how to play. Perhaps it was ridiculous in the Great Dao Sages’ eyes, but that was not necessarily the case to all living beings.
 More people would believe it.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du was very capable in terms of management. The Reincarnation Space he had made previously was still developing. It was enough to show his methods.
 Hearing this, the Sages praised him.
 Han Jue was not arrogant. He felt that this was boring and wanted to not get involved, but he didn’t show it.
 Han Jue didn’t participate in the topic after that.
 After the Primordial Ten Sages’ matter was settled, Pan Xin said, “Life hurt me, when will the Heavenly Dao destroy Life?”
 His tone was indignant.
 The other Sages were silent.
 Life was not something the Heavenly Dao could resist. Who knew how many Great Dao Sages were hidden in it.
 Han Jue asked, “How did Life provoke you?”
 Pan Xin gritted his teeth and said, “They have their eyes on the Chaotic Heavenly Road. In addition, I suspect that one of my Supreme Treasures has been stolen by them!”
 He really couldn’t find a reason. Speaking of which, Life had only wandered the Chaotic Heavenly Road to gather information. He had turned the Heaven-Opening Axe into dust to vent because he had been taught a lesson.
 The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate asked curiously, “What Supreme Treasure is it? The Heaven-Opening Axe or the Chaotic Green Lotus?”
 The other Sages’ expressions turned strange.
 Pan Xin’s Supreme Treasure had been stolen…
 For some reason, Pan Xin felt inexplicably uneasy being stared at by them, as if he had fallen into a tiger’s den. He gritted his teeth and said, “In any case, a treasure has been stolen!”
 Han Jue narrowed his eyes and deduced.
 However, Pan Xin had a huge amount of Heavenly Dao providence on him. He couldn’t deduce it.
 The current Pan Xin was already enslaved. No matter what, he was still Han Jue’s subordinate. He had to stand up for him.
 Han Jue said, “I’ll consider this matter, but Life’s power is unfathomable. Don’t act rashly. Perhaps Life won’t last long even without the Heavenly Dao taking action.”
 Pan Xin could only give up.
 The other Sages also relaxed.
 To Sages, hundreds of thousands of years was really fast.
 They were usually busy cultivating. Like Han Jue, everything changed when they opened their eyes.
 Two hours later, the Sages left.
 After Han Jue returned to the Daoist temple, he first teleported to the second Dao Field and released the long-born Extreme Darkness Fiendcelestial. As usual, Murong Qi came to receive him.
  After that, he returned to the main Dao Field to cultivate.
 The Life faction was restless and would find trouble with the Heavenly Dao sooner or later.
 Han Jue wasn’t the First Life Black Sovereign’s match for the time being, so he felt the pressure. He had to hurry up and cultivate.
 The earlier he achieved the Great Dao, the better!
 In the dark space, there was a dense fog.
 In a pool sat three figures. Other than Li Daokong and Shi Dudao, another person could be seen.
 It was Ancestor Xitian.
 He was more like a mental demon.
 At this moment, a loud voice sounded.
 Hearing this, Ancestor Xitian, Li Daokong, and Shi Dudao opened their eyes.
 The loud voice continued, “Ancestor Xitian, as the leader of Three Lives, go capture the Heavenly Sect Master and the Devil Ancestor Luo Hou.”
 Ancestor Xitian frowned. “The Heavenly Sect Master is too powerful. We’re probably not his match. The Devil Ancestor Luo Hou is the Dao Ancestor’s Dharma idol clone. After provoking the Great Dao Divine Spirit, you want to provoke the Dao Ancestor again?”.
 Li Daokong and Shi Dudao frowned. They had also heard of these two names. They were mighty figures in the ancient legends of the Heavenly Dao.
 “The Heavenly Sect Master has already been severely injured by me. His strength is less than ten percent. You can also convince him. As for Luo Hou, the Dao Ancestor’s providence has spread throughout the Chaos. He is not the only Dharma idol. He will not appear for Luo Hou.
 Ancestor Xitian was silent.
 A door of light appeared beside the pool. Li Daokong frowned and Shi Dudao raised his eyebrows. They all had their own motives and wanted to hide in the Life faction. They didn’t expect to have to carry out a mission so quickly.
 One wanted to eliminate Life, while the other wanted to understand Life and find a chance to fuse into it.
 Ancestor Xitian stood up first and walked towards the door of light. “Let’s go. Perhaps this is our fate.”
 Shi Dudao followed closely behind.
 Li Daokong hesitated for a moment and then chose to follow.
 They had cultivated here for hundreds of thousands of years and their strength had long been overwhelming. They could use this battle to verify their cultivation results.
 In an empty and sinister hall, the Divine Robe Daoist sat in a red pillar of light. His robes fluttered slightly.
 A figure arrived in the hall.
 It was the Curse Fiendcelestial.
 The Curse Fiendcelestial bowed and said, “Exalted God, I need your help.”
 The Divine Robe Daoist opened his eyes and stared at the Curse Fiendcelestial.
 He had never thought much of the Curse Fiendcelestial before. When he became Han Jue’s slave, he didn’t think of it either, so he didn’t mention it to him.
  Now that the Curse Fiendcelestial had appeared, he was considering if he should kill this fellow and ask Han Jue for credit?
 “What is it?” the Divine Robe Daoist asked coldly.
 The Curse Fiendcelestial’s heart tightened. The Divine Robe Daoist had changed.
 Could it be because of the battle with Han Jue that his Dao heart had suffered a setback?
 As the Curse Fiendcelestial thought, he said, “Divine Lord Peacock has been pestering me. If this continues, I’m afraid I’ll die in his hands.”
 At the mention of this, the Curse Fiendcelestial gritted his teeth, his eyes filled with anger.
 His hatred for Divine Lord Peacock had already surpassed his hatred for Han Jue!


 He was also surprised. It had been hundreds of thousands of years. What kind of blood feud was this?
 The Curse Fiendcelestial said gloomily, “I’m not sure, either. It should be related to Han Jue. Divine Lord Peacock has been chasing after me ever since he left the Heavenly Dao. We didn’t know each other at all before this.”
 The Divine Robe Daoist’s eyes flickered. “You mean that Divine Lord Peacock is under Han Jue’s instructions?”.
 The Curse Fiendcelestial nodded and gritted his teeth. “There’s a high chance that Han Jue seems to be proficient in subduing people. I’ve asked around. The Heavenly Dao’s Qiu Xilai and Heavenly Venerate Wufa were once enemies with Han Jue. Now, they are Han Jue’s strongest supporters. It’s the same for the Calamity Race’s Heavenly Calamity Emperor. It’s strange that Divine Lord Peacock can escape unscathed from the Heavenly Dao. There’s only one possibility, and that is that he has submitted to Han Jue!
 “That’s right! That must be it!”
 With the Divine Robe Daoist’s reminder, the Curse Fiendcelestial connected to other information and quickly figured it out.
  Hatred appeared on his face.
 Damn Han Jue, he stole my Great Dao and kept chasing after me!
 Although he hated Han Jue, he had never targeted him. Why did Han Jue keep chasing after him?
 This was too much!
 No!
 He was bullying the Great Dao too much!
 The Curse Fiendcelestial looked up at the Divine Robe Daoist and said, “Exalted God, I’m not asking you to kill Han Jue. Kill Divine Lord Peacock first!”
 However, the Divine Robe Daoist did not answer him. Instead, he stared at him.
 The atmosphere became strange.
 The Curse Fiendcelestial seemed to have thought of something. The poisonous worm on his face stopped and his body trembled slightly.
 He said, “Forget it since you’re troubled. I won’t disturb your cultivation…”
 He turned around and wanted to leave. Just as he moved, a powerful force suddenly froze him. He couldn’t move.
 “Don’t leave since you’re already here.”
 The Divine Robe Daoist’s voice entered the Curse Fiendcelestial’s ears.
 The Curse Fiendcelestial’s eyes widened in despair.
 I see!
 No wonder the Divine Robe Daoist could return alive!
 This move…
 The Curse Fiendcelestial suddenly felt fear towards Han Jue.
 Han Jue was not as cautious as he looked. He wasn’t only guarding an area. Now, it seemed that Han Jue had been plotting ahead. Protecting the Heavenly Dao was only the surface, making people think that he was just afraid of being disturbed.
 Oh no!
 He was screwed!
 Buzhou Divine Mountain.
 Han Yu sat under the old tree. A cool breeze blew past and fused with the world, turning into a beautiful painting.
 At this moment…
 Han Yu suddenly opened his eyes. He raised his eyebrows and muttered, “What is this feeling…”
 He stood up and walked down the mountain.
 At the foot of the mountain, a woman in green lay on the ground. Her abdomen was stained red with blood and her face was pale. She was on the verge of death.
 Han Yu appeared in front of her with a frown.
Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n)) Fighting was forbidden on Buzhou Divine Mountain. In other words, this woman had fled here with injuries.
 Han Yu hesitated for a moment before healing her injuries.
 With his cultivation level, treating an Immortal Realm cultivator was as easy as flipping his palm.
 Soon, the woman in green woke up.
 Han Yu had already disappeared. The woman in green was pleasantly surprised to find that her injuries had healed.
 She touched her abdomen and muttered, “So there really is a Human Ancestor in seclusion here.”
 She stood up and turned to look at the peak that she could not see. Her eyes became firm as she resolutely went up the mountain.
 Several months later, the woman in green stopped halfway up the mountain. Looking up, rolling thunderclouds surrounded the mountain, forming an insurmountable cloud wall.
 Her voice was very pleasant, but Han Yu was unmoved.
 The woman in green shouted for several days but did not receive a reply. She found a place to meditate and cultivate, waiting for the senior to answer.
 She waited for three thousand years.
 Under the old tree, Han Yu opened his eyes with interest.
 He asked, “Three thousand years have passed, do you still want revenge?”
 The woman in green in meditation suddenly opened her eyes in surprise.
 She hurriedly stood up and knelt down. She cupped her fists and said, “Yes, Senior!”
 “What hatred is it? It’s been three thousand years and you still can’t let it go?”
 The woman in green was only at the Immortal Realm. Three thousand years wasn’t a short period of time for her.
 Hearing this, the woman in green replied, “The hatred of killing my master. My master adopted me and raised me like his own daughter. I won’t be able to live in peace if I don’t avenge him.”
 Han Yu pinched his fingers to deduce and his expression turned strange.
 Not hearing anything, the woman in green hurriedly said, “Senior, are you still there? I don’t need you to help me take revenge. You can just teach me a Mystical Power. I will serve you forever after I take revenge!”
 Han Yu said faintly, “Your master is an Immortal Emperor, so your enemy is an Immortal Emperor. Do you know what an Immortal Emperor means?”
 The woman in green was silent for a while before gritting her teeth. “I know it’s difficult, but I have to do it.”
 “Then, do you know who’s behind that Immortal Emperor?”
 “I don’t know…”
 The green-robed woman’s face was pale. Although she didn’t know who the enemy’s backing was, she knew that in the Immortal World, all cultivators had their own relationships. The higher their cultivation level, the greater their background.
 Han Yu said casually, “That’s a Deity Realm cultivator.”
 The woman in green trembled and lowered her head.
 Deity Realm…
 The woman in green did not dare to imagine. She had only heard of existences above the Immortal Emperor Realm, but she had never seen them.
 She had once witnessed an Immortal Emperor attack. It could be said to be able to pluck the stars and move the moon. It was overwhelming and peerlessly powerful. Even an Immortal Emperor was like this, let alone a Deity Realm cultivator.
 “Do you know who’s behind that Deity Realm cultivator?”
 The woman lowered her head even more.
 Han Yu continued, “When will revenge end? There’s always someone stronger. Hatred is endless. Why go that far?”
 The woman in green gritted her teeth and said, “I’m not willing to give up. I want revenge even if I have to die for it!”
 Han Yu stopped talking.
 The woman in green continued kneeling.
 She knelt for five hundred years.
 As she knelt, she absorbed Qi and cultivated. She was still recalling the senior’s words.
 Should she take revenge?
  On this day, Han Yu’s voice floated down again, “Have you thought it through?”
 The woman in green was stunned for a moment before she subconsciously said, “I want… revenge!”
 Her expression became firm when she said the last word.
 With that said, the rolling thunderclouds above her suddenly dispersed. Strands of sunlight scattered down and shone on the woman in green, making her feel as if a lifetime had passed.
 She looked up and saw a figure standing at the edge of the cliff, looking down at her.
 She was stunned as her gaze focused on him.
 She thought that this senior had white hair, but she didn’t expect him to be such a handsome man. Never having seen such a handsome man before, she was momentarily stunned.
 Han Yu smiled and said, “Come on up. Since you insist, I’ll teach you a Mystical Power. However, I won’t take you in as my disciple. It’s just to add a hint of interest to the boring years.”
