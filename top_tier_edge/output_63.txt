 “Fellow Daoist, why aren’t you saying anything?” Jiang Yi looked at Dao Sovereign and asked. He couldn’t help but be moved.
 Dao Sovereign closed his eyes and frowned. Killing intent flowed between his brows and he was in a strange state.
 Zhao Xuanyuan and Lao Dan turned around and also sensed that something was wrong.
 Lao Dan flashed in front of Dao Sovereign and tapped him. However, no matter how he cast his spell, Dao Sovereign could not wake up.
 Zhao Xuanyuan asked nervously, “Will something happen to him?”
 They were all Freedom Sages and had not been affected by such evil for a long time.
 Lao Dan said with a solemn expression, “Something’s wrong. Something’s too wrong. He’s not injured at all. There are no abnormal Dharmic powers in his body. His soul is also here. How can this be…”
 He went behind Dao Sovereign and continued to check his body.
 At this moment…
  Dao Sovereign opened his eyes and suddenly stood up. He kicked Lao Dan away and disappeared into the mist.
 Zhao Xuanyuan and Jiang Yi were shocked. They immediately assumed a posture and prepared to fight.
 Dao Sovereign turned to look at them. At this moment, his eyes had changed. His pupils were like two black snakes connected head to tail. It was abnormally terrifying.
 ......
 “Fellow Daoist, what’s wrong?” Zhao Xuanyuan asked seriously. He had never encountered such a situation before.
 Jiang Yi said, “Is his will occupied by something?”
 Dao Sovereign smiled sinisterly. “Two little children. Their potential is not bad. It just so happens that I need Chaotic Lifeform servants.”
 At this moment, Lao Dan appeared in front of the two of them. He stared at Dao Sovereign and asked, “Who are you? Why are you occupying my disciple-nephew’s body?”
 Dao Sovereign stretched his neck and said, “Don’t worry, I won’t harm him. If you obey me, there will be great opportunities in the future. Have you heard of the legend of the Ancient Desolate?”
 Legend of the Ancient Desolate?
 Lao Dan frowned. Zhao Xuanyuan and Jiang Yi looked at each other. They were thinking about how to attack.
 Dao Sovereign said, “I am the spirit of the Ancient Desolate. From now on, I will summon endless Dao Devils and the ghosts at the bottom of the Chaos to overturn the Chaos together. If you assist me in advance, you can avoid death and obtain a transcendent status in the new Chaos.”
 Lao Dan smiled faintly. “You make it sound so tempting, but do you really understand the Chaos? Why do you want to destroy the Chaos? The previous twenty thousand Divine Authority Generals all fell in front of the Heavenly Dao. The Divine Authority Generals are equivalent to Great Dao Sages and are first-rate Great Dao Sages!”
 With that said, the surrounding mist began to churn like flood dragons. The scene was spectacular and terrifying.
 Lao Dan narrowed his eyes and clenched his fists in his sleeves.
 Dao Sovereign slowly rose and spread his hands. He smiled wildly and said, “Do you know that the Great Dao Sage is at the Great Dao Primordial Chaos Realm? Above this Great Dao Primordial Chaos Realm is the Great Dao Supreme Realm!”
 The three of them were moved.
 Jiang Yi asked in a low voice, “Are you a Great Dao Supreme?”
 Dao Sovereign laughed wantonly, his laughter filled with disdain. “I’ve long surpassed the Great Dao Supreme and reached a higher level! The Great Dao Sages are no different from mortals in front of me. So what if there are more of them? If the Divine Might Heavenly Sage can destroy twenty thousand Divine Authority Generals, I can destroy two hundred thousand!”
 were
 Zhao Xuanyuan, Jiang Yi, and Lao Dan were shocked.
 Even Lao Dan did not know that there was a realm beyond the Great Dao Supreme Realm.
 After all, his main body was only at the Great Dao Supreme Realm.
 If what this fellow said was true, it was really possible to change the Chaos!
 Jiang Yi asked angrily, “Why are you trampling on the Heavenly Dao? Are you Chaotic mighty figures crazy? You always find trouble with the Heavenly Dao!”
 Dao Sovereign looked at him coldly. The terrifying killing intent locked onto him, making him cold and nervous.
 Although he was afraid, Jiang Yi’s arrogance still made him glare at Dao Sovereign.
  Jiang Yi was also the number one prodigy who had suppressed the world in the Heavenly Dao!
 Dao Sovereign suddenly smiled. “Hmph, seeing that you’re a junior, I won’t bicker with you. Why is the Heavenly Dao suffering so much? That’s because the Heavenly Dao has done too many sins! The Dao Ancestor pretended to disappear and really thought that he could let everything go? Impossible! Let’s see if that Dao Ancestor can still sit still when I flatten the Heavenly Dao!”
 Lao Dan asked in confusion, “You told us so much. Do you really think highly of us?”
 Dao Sovereign smiled and said, “Think highly of you? I’m just giving you a chance. My will is spread billions of times throughout the various worlds. Talking to you here will not waste my time, understand?
 “You have nowhere to run. Either follow me or wait for death!”
 He suddenly glanced at Zhao Xuanyuan, his eyes flickering.
 At this moment, Zhao Xuanyuan’s consciousness had already entered the Myriad Worlds Projection.
 “Something bad has happened! The Heavenly Dao is threatened again! The three of us have been captured!” Zhao Xuanyuan shouted anxiously. At this moment, there were only a few people in the Myriad Worlds Projection, including the Black Hell Chicken.
 The Black Hell Chicken yawned. “If you want help, so be it. Don’t brag. No one can save you. Either that or ask Master for help.”
 Zhao Xuanyuan gritted his teeth. “The other party is from the Ancient Desolate and claims to be able to kill 200,000 Divine Authority Generals. I don’t dare to rashly summon Master!”
 Two hundred thousand Divine Authority Generals!
 The Black Hell Chicken trembled in fear.
 Before it could speak, Zhao Xuanyuan suddenly disappeared.
 The Black Hell Chicken left the Myriad Worlds Projection and gathered all the Chaotic Fiendcelestials to report what Zhao Xuanyuan had just said.
 Guan Bubai snorted. “That’s normal. The Chaos is endless. In addition to the long years, there are naturally countless hidden mighty figures.”
 The other Fiendcelestials had solemn expressions.
 There were already Divine Authority Generals in the simulation trial. They had all challenged them before and could not even defeat one. They were all insta-killed.
 Xun Chang’an pondered. His words were agreed by the Fiendcelestials.
 Currently, they were not strong enough to resist a Great Dao Supreme.
 The Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial said unhappily, “Our growth speed is still too slow. Three Fiendcelestials must attain the Great Dao in a million years, understand?”
 He scanned the others. Most of them did not dare to look at him.
 The Great Dao was not so easy to attain!
 Even a Chaotic Fiendcelestial needed time!
 In the blink of an eye, a hundred thousand years passed.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and let Xing Hongxuan and Han Huang in.
 “Husband, something bad has happened! The Heavenly Dao is facing another calamity! Your disciple has been captured!” Xing Hongxuan said anxiously. Han Huang’s expression did not change, but he was very curious.
  Han Jue said, “Tell me slowly and clearly.”
 At the same time, he pinched his fingers to deduce and discovered that the karma of Dao Sovereign and the other two had indeed disappeared.
 He checked their interpersonal relationships. Their portraits were still there.
 Xing Hongxuan recounted what she had learned from the Black Hell Chicken.
 He could kill 200,000 Divine Authority Generals?
 From the Ancient Desolate?
 Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit!
 Han Jue said, “I already know about this. I’ll think of a way.”
 Han Huang couldn’t help but ask, “Father, I just fought a Divine Authority General to a draw not long ago. Can you really kill twenty thousand Divine Authority Generals with one strike?”


 “I was just lucky. I attacked before the twenty thousand Divine Authority Generals made their move, so I killed them in one go,” Han Jue muttered.
 Han Huang was enlightened.
 Han Huang asked, “Then, are you going to save your disciples? They are all my senior brothers. Bring me along!”
 Han Jue glared at him. “The other party can kill 200,000 Divine Authority Generals. How can I deal with them? You can’t be rash about this. Don’t go and die.”
 Go and die?
 Han Huang was stunned but soon understood what he meant. Han Jue was mocking him for overestimating himself.
 “Father, I also want to help you. I’m a Great Dao Sage now. Although I can’t defeat the enemy, I won’t be a burden!” Han Huang said angrily.
 How powerful was the Great Dao Sage? He could observe the entire Chaos and know the past and present. He was not restricted by the three thousand Great Dao. Even if he was inferior to that enemy, he was still a threat.
  Han Jue said helplessly, “I have a junior who has unparalleled talent in the Chaos. After attaining the Great Dao, he was suppressed by a mighty figure for hundreds of thousands of years. If not for me, he would probably have died. His potential is not worth mentioning in the Chaos. His current cultivation and strength are what he relies on.”
 Han Huang frowned.
 ......
 With that, he turned around and left.
 Xing Hongxuan covered her mouth and chuckled as she watched the father and son fight.
 However, they did not like to fail!
 Han Jue was afraid of failure, so he fled the battle.
 Han Huang was afraid of failure, so he did not act on impulse.
 Xing Hongxuan spoke to Han Jue for a while before quickly leaving. She knew that he needed to think alone.
 Xing Hongxuan didn’t dare to raise any objections. She couldn’t help, either. The only thing she could do was not to cause trouble for him.
 Han Jue was the only one left in the temple. Not worried, he started to check the emails.
 With his experience, as long as the three of them were not dead, they would not die in half a day.
 The enemy had already suppressed them. They would have killed them long ago if that was their intention.
 Han Jue was already used to his disciples being caught. If they really couldn’t take it, they would use the Invocation Technique on him.
 [Your disciple Dao Sovereign was possessed by a mysterious mighty figure.]
 (Your good friend Evil Heavenly Emperor has spied on the True Meaning of Chaos. His cultivation has increased greatly.)
 [Your disciple Zhou Fan was attacked) x90
 [Your grand-disciple Chu Shiren cut away the three corpses and created the Evil Buddha.]
 (Your son Han Tuo was attacked by a mysterious Dao Devil) x109783222
 [Your good friend Yi Tian was attacked by a mysterious Dao Devil] x108782221
 Han Jue showed a frown.
 Jiang Jueshi had even begun to break through to the Great Dao?
 He failed?
 He pinched his fingers to deduce. So it was a Great Dao Divine Spirit who stopped Jiang Jueshi from attaining the Dao.
 Jiang Jueshi did not have a powerful background, at least on the surface, so it was very easy for him to be suppressed by a mighty figure.
  The more Great Dao Sages there were, the worse it was for them.
 Previously, Han Huang had successfully broken through because the Divine Robe Daoist had personally protected him. Even the Great Dao Sages had to give him face.
 Han Jue looked at Jiang Jueshi.
 At this moment, his disciple was meditating and cultivating. He did not seem affected.
 Han Jue didn’t find trouble with that Great Dao Divine Spirit. Instead, he sent a dream to the Divine Robe Daoist and told him about Jiang Jueshi’s relationship with him, asking him to take care of him in the future.
 Although the universe of stars was not under the Divine Robe Daoist’s jurisdiction, he could protect Jiang Jueshi at the door of the Great Dao.
 After that, Han Jue sent a dream to Jiang Jueshi.
 Jiang Jueshi opened his eyes and hurriedly bowed when he saw Han Jue, who was covered in divine light.
 Han Jue said, “Why didn’t you tell me that you failed?”
 Jiang Jueshi said in shame, “I’m ashamed. How can I ask you for help? I tried my best but couldn’t open that door. I even suffered a backlash. Sigh.”
 Han Jue said, “Someone is blocking the door. I’ve already instructed a mighty figure to protect you next time. It’s not difficult for you to attain the Great Dao with your potential. Don’t be discouraged.”
 Hearing this, Jiang Jueshi was stunned for a moment before he was overjoyed and hurriedly knelt to thank him.
 Han Jue waved his sleeve and said, “You still need to work hard after attaining the Great Dao. Your goal is to participate in the Chaotic Assembly. Not only you, but my other disciples will also participate. Don’t be careless. Your potential is impressive, but you might not be the best in the entire sect.”
 Jiang Jueshi nodded. He had long recognized this.
 Not to mention the others, he only knew two people. Not to mention Liu Bei, just Han Huang made him feel ordinary.
 “Master, what’s Little Junior’s cultivation level?” Jiang Jueshi couldn’t help but ask.
 Han Jue didn’t hide anything. “He’s already attained the Great Dao.”
 Jiang Jueshi was moved. He felt a sense of urgency that he had not felt for a long time.
 His Dao heart was still stable.
 He was not a prodigy, to begin with. He only had great opportunities and talent.
 “Will Little Junior Brother participate in the Chaotic Assembly?”
 Han Jue smiled. “Of course.”
 Jiang Jueshi’s eyes lit up.
 He could suppress Han Huang previously, but he would do the same to him in the future!
 Han Jue didn’t say anything else and removed the dream.
 He began to cultivate.
 He had to break through first. It might not be safe to deal with the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit now, but his strength would definitely increase when he broke through. He was not far from breaking through. He could do it in at most a hundred thousand years.
 The cultivation speed of the Ultimate Origin Fiendcelestial was very fast.
  In the Ancient Desolate, dense mist filled the air, and mountains rose and fell. There were countless rivers and lakes. It was like a desolate ancient world.
 At this moment, in the sky of the Ancient Desolate, the Ultimate God of Punishment stepped on the clouds.
 The Ultimate God of Punishment was still wearing blood-stained divine armor. His aura was oppressive and the airwaves around him were like long dragons.
 Soon, he arrived in front of an endless lake. It was like an ocean. The surface of the lake was filled with mist, as if there was a terrifying beast hidden inside.
 The Ultimate God of Punishment said, “Fellow Daoist, we meet an old friend. Aren’t you going to show yourself?”.
 A cold voice sounded, “Since you’re here, you should indeed appear. However, you’re the leader of the Divine Spirits now. I wonder if you still remember our past relationship.”
 The Ultimate God of Punishment said, “You want to take revenge on the Dao Ancestor. I only want to protect the Chaos. There’s no conflict, right?”
 The world fell silent.
 The Ultimate God of Punishment said, “Could it be that you also want to touch the Chaos?”
 “Of course not, but I want to ask you, Ultimate God, can you control the power of a Supreme Divine Authority like the Divine Authority General?” the other party asked coldly.


 The Ultimate God of Punishment was silent upon facing the question of the mysterious existence of the Great Swamp.
 Although he was the leader of the Divine Spirits, he did not control the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority like the Primordial Ancestor God and could not mobilize the Divine Authority Generals.
 From this point of view, he was not the true leader of the Divine Spirits.
 He had been trying to control the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority, but he did not succeed. Therefore, he felt that there was a higher existence behind the Great Dao Supreme Divine Authority.
 The mysterious existence’s voice sounded again.
 The Ultimate God of Punishment sighed. “But can I believe you? You obtained the Chaotic Qi’s providence. Will you treat the Chaos
 well?”
 This mysterious existence was the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit!
  The Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit said faintly, “If you believe me, help me. If you don’t, I will also insist. Ultimate God, I don’t have many good friends, and there aren’t many who survived. It can even be said that only you are left. I’ve been suppressed for so many years. I can’t do anything if you still don’t believe me.”
 The Ultimate God of Punishment smiled. “Fellow Daoist, you must be joking. I came to see you because of our relationship. It’s just that I have to be responsible for all the living beings in the Chaos now. If you haven’t forgotten the agreement in the past, I naturally believe you.”
 The Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit sighed. “The agreement of the past was really long ago. Fellow Daoist, please believe me. I can sense that there are mysterious existences above the Great Dao Divine Spirit. We can only join forces to truly break through the old situation of the Chaos!”
 The Ultimate God of Punishment nodded. “I often feel that I’m being spied on. I even feel that the Primordial Ancestor God might not really have died. Perhaps his origin will is still hidden in the Divine Authority and waiting for an opportunity to reappear.”
 The surface of the lake stirred up two rows of huge waves that slapped in the opposite direction, causing a valley in the middle to open.
 The Ultimate God immediately walked into the air.
 …
 Time passed quickly.
 More than seventy thousand years later.
 Han Jue finally broke through and reached the late-stage Great Dao Supreme Realm.
 He checked his attributes panel as he consolidated his cultivation.
 [Name: Han Jue]
 [Lifespan: 7,381,785 / 1,099,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,99 9,999,999,999,999,999]
 (Race: Ultimate Origin Fiendcelestial (Immeasurable Emperor)]
 (Cultivation: Late-stage Great Dao Supreme Realm (Perfect Sage)]
 [Technique: Primordial Chaos Reincarnation Great Dao (Great Dao), Heavenly Cycle Body Tempering] (Great Dao: Great Dao of Life and Death, Great Dao of Karma, Great Dao of Extreme Origin]
 His lifespan doubled again. Han Jue couldn’t be bothered to calculate.
 He could feel the Ultimate Origin Power transforming crazily. This power was too obvious. It far exceeded the feeling of breaking through previously, as if it was breaking through a major realm!
 A true transformation!
 Was this the Ultimate Origin Fiendcelestial?
 Han Jue was overjoyed.
 He wanted to see how many Foolish Sword Sages he could fight now.
 Three thousand years later.
 Han Jue’s cultivation finally stabilized.
 He began to cultivate his Mystical Powers.
 Five hundred years later.
 There were five hundred new Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols. Currently, he had grasped 2,949. He was already extremely close to the three thousand Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols.
 He would definitely be able to control three thousand Fiendcelestials as long as he broke through to the perfected realm!
 Han Jue was already looking forward to that day.
 At least before the Chaotic Assembly!
 At that time, he would better protect his disciples and let them show their talent.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and started the simulation trial.
Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates He directly challenged 200,000 Foolish Sword Sages!
 The Great Dao Supreme Realm Foolish Sword Sage claimed that he could fight a hundred Divine Authority Generals. Han Jue was equivalent to fighting twenty million Divine Authority Generals!
 Indeed, Han Jue’s strength advanced by leaps and bounds after breaking through a minor realm.
 The increase in strength of the Ultimate Origin Fiendcelestial could not be reflected by cultivation.
 Han Jue used his full strength to kill 200,000 Foolish Sword Sages with the Divine Might Great Heaven Palm!
 He added another ten thousand.
  No problem!
 Instant kill!
 220,000 Foolish Sword Sages!
 Han Jue had no choice but to use the Primordial Judgment Sword to insta-kill them.
 The number of opponents continued to increase!
 The limit of Han Jue’s insta-kill was 250,000 Foolish Sword Sages. He could still kill them all if he faced 300,000 of them, but he couldn’t insta-kill them.
 He only cared about insta-kills.
 In his opinion, as long as he was not insta-killed, the enemy would have a chance to escape or even counterattack.
 Han Jue began to challenge the Divine Authority Generals. He directly challenged thirty million in one go.
 However, he discovered that the number of Divine Authority Generals no longer meant anything to him.
 It was also easy for him to challenge 50 million Foolish Sword Sages.
 Han Jue no longer fought with the Divine Authority Generals.
 “Can I insta-kill the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit?” Han Jue asked silently.
 (100 trillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [Not for the time being.)
 Han Jue was a little disappointed.
 The Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit said that he could kill 200,000 Divine Authority Generals, but that did not mean that that was his limit. After all, he didn’t have a simulation trial.
 This could only mean one thing. The Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit did not care about the Divine Authority Generals.
 Han Jue hesitated for a moment and asked, “If I’m serious, can the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit kill me?”
 This question and the previous question were both related to the cultivation of the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit. There should be no need to deduct his lifespan.
 After all, the two questions were asked one after another. The cultivation of the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit did not change.
 [No]
 That was good.
 In other words, they were evenly matched.
 Han Jue thought for a moment and sent a dream to Zhao Xuanyuan.
 The dream was the Hundred Peak Immortal River. Zhao Xuanyuan opened his eyes and saw Han Jue. He was immediately excited.
 Han Jue said, “Did Laozi save Lao Dan?”
 Zhao Xuanyuan shook his head.
 Han Jue asked, “Who led the way this time?”
 He understood what Han Jue meant. He was suspecting Lao Dan.
 Han Jue asked, “How’s your situation? Can you wait any longer?”
 Zhao Xuanyuan nodded. “We’ll pretend to submit and be fine for the time being. It’s just that Dao Sovereign has been possessed and his safety is unknown.
 “Master, we’re fine. You can save us if you’re confident. After all, the enemy is mysterious and powerful this time.”
  Han Jue said meaningfully, “You can send news in the Myriad Worlds Projection if Laozi makes a move.”
 Zhao Xuanyuan hurriedly agreed.
 Han Jue left the dream.
 Then, he flashed into the Universal Hall.
 At this moment, other than Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du, there was another person in the hall. It was the prodigy that the Heavenly Dao had finally nurtured with all its might, Azure Heaven Mystic.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du saw Han Jue and hurriedly stood up to bow.
 Azure Heaven Mystic turned around and saw Han Jue. He was puzzled. Who was this person?
 Han Jue nodded and asked, “Can we talk?”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “Of course. This is the new Sage of the Heavenly Dao, Azure Heaven Mystic. This is the Divine Might Heavenly Sage. Aren’t you going to bow?”
 Hearing this, Azure Heaven Mystic stood up and bowed to Han Jue. He looked at him with a burning gaze.


 Han Jue glanced at Azure Heaven Mystic and didn’t say anything. He didn’t want to have anything to do with this fellow.
 After all, a Dao Creator was behind Azure Heaven Mystic. This kid was only a pawn.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du waved his hand and gestured for Azure Heaven Mystic to leave.
 Azure Heaven Mystic stared at Han Jue and hesitated. In the end, he was forced to leave by Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du’s gaze.
 Only Han Jue and Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du were left in the hall. The two Sages sat down.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du smiled and said, “That Azure Heaven Mystic is the most talented person in the Heavenly Dao now. We have decided to nurture him to make a name for himself in the Chaotic Assembly. I wonder if you have any intention of taking in another disciple?”
 Han Jue shook his head and smiled. “Forget it. If I accept him again, it will seem like I’m plotting something. I have to leave some prodigies to you so that the Heavenly Dao can be passed down.”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du smiled. He was only being polite and naturally wanted to recruit the prodigies of the world.
 “Heavenly Sage, why are you here?” “The Heavenly Dao is facing another calamity.”
  “What?”
 Han Jue recounted what he knew. He was not afraid that the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit would deduce that this fellow had captured his disciple and still wanted to flatten the Heavenly Dao. There was no room for negotiation.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du’s expression was extremely ugly after he finished speaking.
 To dare say that he could kill two hundred thousand Divine Authority Generals, such an expert was indeed terrifying.
 He looked at him and asked, “What are your chances of winning against the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit?”
 Han Jue shook his head.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du’s heart sank.
 Han Jue said, “Make preparations early. I think the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit is also related to the leader of the Divine Spirits. Of course, it’s only a guess. I mean that the Heavenly Dao can only rely on itself, understand?”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du nodded.
 Han Jue asked, “By the way, what kind of existence is the Dao Ancestor?”
 An existence who was powerful enough to suppress a perfected Great Dao Supreme was afraid of the Great Dao Divine Spirit and suppressed the development of the Heavenly Dao.
 It was really strange.
 In Han Jue’s opinion, the Primordial Ancestor God was not the Dao Ancestor’s match.
 As for the five Dao Creators, they transcended the Chaos and did not care about it at all. Why would the Dao Ancestor be afraid?
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “I actually don’t know the Dao Ancestor very well. In the past, I only listened to the Dao in the Purple Firmament Palace. Ever since the Dao Ancestor disappeared, I discovered that my impression of him slowly dissipated. I can’t remember his appearance or even his words. I can only remember that he once existed.”
 Speaking of this, Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du had an extremely strange expression.
 Han Jue showed a frown.
 The Dao Ancestor’s concealment technique was so powerful?
 He erased all living beings’ memories of him?
 With that, Han Jue disappeared.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du did not move and frowned.
 He sighed heavily.
 He thought that he could enjoy a long period of peace.
 He was filled with resentment.
 These seniors were too unreliable!
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du shook his head and smiled bitterly. “Come in.”
 Azure Heaven Mystic, who was waiting outside the hall, transformed into a cool breeze and instantly arrived in front of him.
 “Where’s the Divine Might Heavenly Sage?” Azure Heaven Mystic looked around and asked in confusion.
 Azure Heaven Mystic said unhappily, “Why can’t I see him?”
 His talent had already been recognized and was world-shattering. If not for the Sages stopping him from going to the Chaos, he would very likely shatter the legend of the Divine Might Heavenly Sage’s Dao attainment speed.
 “The Divine Might Heavenly Sage is busy. What right do you have to see him? No matter how powerful your potential is, it’s only potential. Even I can’t see him any time I want.” Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du shook his head.
 Azure Heaven Mystic was silent.
 Although these words were a little hurtful, it was the truth.
 If it was anyone else, he would definitely not be convinced, but the other party was the Divine Might Heavenly Sage. He had no choice but to be convinced.
 However, after reaching the Sage Realm, he knew that the Divine Might Heavenly Sage was already the strongest in the Chaos!
 He worshiped the Divine Might Heavenly Sage even more!
 Of course, it was only admiration. He had always wanted to surpass the Divine Might Heavenly Sage.
 One day, he would definitely challenge the Divine Might Heavenly Sage. It was not for life and death, but for strength!
 “Heavenly Venerate, I think it’s time for me to go to the Chaos. The Heavenly Dao has already made it difficult for my cultivation level to advance,” Qing Tian said seriously.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du’s expression did not change, but he was very hesitant.
 He was afraid that Azure Heaven Mystic’s existence would be found out by other worlds, especially the Three Pure Sacred World.
 However, he thought of Han Jue.
 How could he be poached if he really belonged to the Heavenly Dao?
 Han Jue didn’t even care about Azure Heaven Mystic. Why was he so worried?
 Besides, the more he suppressed this fellow, the easier it was for something to happen.
 Azure Heaven Mystic smiled. “Don’t worry. I’m not a rash person. Besides, I’m the kindest and won’t slaughter the innocent.”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said helplessly, “Yes, but you like fighting. This is a disaster.”
 “I understand. I’ll change!”
 Azure Heaven Mystic waved his hand impatiently.
 He hated preaching the most.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du ignored his attitude and continued to remind him. Several hours later, Azure Heaven Mystic was finally freed. Before he left, Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du even gave him a Supreme Treasure, making him secretly touched.
 Azure Heaven Mystic also understood that the Sages were afraid that he would betray the Heavenly Dao, so they did not dare to let him go to the Chaos. He didn’t hate this. Instead, his heart warmed, but he did not say anything
 This attitude showed his status and importance in the Heavenly Dao.
 This was what he wanted the most.
 In the Daoist temple of the third Dao Field.
 Han Jue looked at Jiang Jueshi and Han Huang for a while before checking the emails.
 He saw that Dao Sovereign was often tortured.
 He hesitated to use the Book of Misfortune.
  The Book of Misfortune was strong, but it might not be able to curse the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit to death. It might even alert it.
 Han Jue wanted to destroy him in one go and not give him a chance to escape.
 He would copy his cultivation first!
 Han Jue immediately sent a dream to the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit.
 He looked at him and asked, “Who are you? You can actually forcefully pull me into a dream. Your methods are impressive.”
 Han Jue said, “I’m Cao Cao of the Wei Divine World. You captured my disciples. Can you let them go?”
 “Cao Cao of the Wei Divine World?”
 The Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit seemed to be deducing.


 “This fellow has already possessed my disciple, but he’s still calculating. How pretentious,” Han Jue thought disdainfully.
 The Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit asked, “Who are your disciples?”.
 Han Jue said, “Dao Sovereign, Zhao Xuanyuan, Jiang Yi.”
 As for Lao Dan, he did not mention him. After all, it was Lao Dan’s suggestion to go to the bottom of the Chaos. He couldn’t rule out a
 !!
 trap.
 Leave Lao Dan to Laozi.
 The Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit chuckled. “I have some impression of these three. Their potential is indeed extraordinary. I’m afraid I can’t return them to you.”
 Han Jue smiled and asked, “Fellow Daoist, you’re really willful.”
  He directly used the Dark Forbidden Zone and turned the dream into reality, quickly scanning the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit’s cultivation.
 The Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit said meaningfully, “The dream has turned into reality. The Divine Might Heavenly Sage is indeed impressive. It seems that if I want to flatten the Heavenly Dao, I have to eliminate you first.”
 Han Jue had already activated all his Supreme Treasures. “Why must you deal with the Heavenly Dao? Every injustice has its perpetrator and every debt has its debtor. Can’t you look for the Dao Ancestor? Besides, the Heavenly Dao and the Ancient Desolate share the same origin. You’re equivalent to fighting among brothers.”
 The Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit was actually equivalent to a Heavenly Dao Divine Spirit, but it was separated.
 The Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit smiled. “Fellow Daoist, you really know a lot. However, why are you so naive? Or are you pretending not to know? The Dao Ancestor has long fused with the Heavenly Dao. He didn’t disappear. He only transformed into the Heavenly Dao.”
 The Dao Ancestor was in the Heavenly Dao?
 The Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit smiled disdainfully. “Since you want to fight, let me see how powerful the Divine Might Heavenly Sage is!”
 He suddenly raised his hand, and a black aura transformed into a fog that drowned Han Jue.
 The fog was filled with terrifying negative karma and resentment. It was extremely cold. In a daze, it was as if there were billions of ghosts wailing and roaring.
 Han Jue immediately used the Divine Might Great Heaven Palm. The power of his final essence poured out and transformed into a domineering palm force that destroyed all the surrounding fog.
 He used the Great Dao of Traversal and the Great Dao of Space to quickly escape.
 How fast was he?
 “Divine Might Heavenly Sage, you are indeed very strong. However, it’s impossible for you to escape me. The Heavenly Dao will be flattened when I create eight quadrillion Dao Devils!”
 The voice of the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit entered Han Jue’s ears. His tone was filled with joy, as if Han Jue was the Dao Ancestor and he was taking revenge.
 [The Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit has developed hatred towards you. Current Hatred Points: 6 stars]
 Han Jue ignored him and quickly returned to the Heavenly Dao. He jumped into the Hundred Peak Immortal River and went to the third Dao Field.
 The reason why he took a detour was that he was afraid of harming the universe.
 Han Jue sat on the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus and heaved a sigh of relief.
 It had to be said that the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit was indeed powerful. It had given him a very dangerous feeling just now.
 However, it was only a dangerous feeling!
 The pressure did not turn into despair!
 Han Jue began the simulation trial and challenged the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit.
 Five minutes later, he opened his eyes with an extremely solemn expression.
 The Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit was amazing!
 Han Jue finally saw the Dao Devils. The Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit’s Dao Devil Mystical Power was similar to the three thousand Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols. It contained different Great Dao powers, but there were a thousand types. It was not as many as him.
 In the end, Han Jue still successfully killed the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit, but it took him five minutes to fight with all his might.
 This was a simulation trial. The Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit attacked with all his might, only attacking and not retreating.
 Han Jue had heard that there were also Great Dao Sages among the Dao Devils!
 Who knew how many Great Dao Sages were hidden among the eight quadrillion Dao Devils?
 Most importantly was the Ultimate God’s attitude.
 Han Jue felt that the Ultimate God of Punishment was related to the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit. He could guess from the previous conversation that what he had said to the Ultimate God had very likely been told to the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit.
 Han Jue continued the simulation trial and tried to find a way to insta-kill the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit.
 Several days later.
 Han Jue stopped the simulation trial. It would take at least thirty breaths of time to kill the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit.
 Thirty breaths was too long!
 Something would definitely happen in the meantime!
 It would be bad if the Ultimate God of Punishment also joined in.
 “I want to know how long until the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit attacks the Heavenly Dao?” Han Jue asked in his mind.
 From the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit’s words, it would probably take some time.
 [100 trillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [About 2.8 million years.]
 It was neither long nor short.
 Compared to the previous crises, 2.8 million years was too little time for a Great Dao Sage to improve, let alone a Great Dao Supreme.
 But it was different to Han Jue.
 He was the Ultimate Origin Fiendcelestial that surpassed all living beings by two bloodline levels!
 He might be able to break through again in 2.8 million years. Han Jue perked up and his eyes flickered coldly.
 Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit, you’re dead!
 Han Jue decided to use the Book of Misfortune to stall for time in the future.
 In the depths of the Ancient Desolate, a huge palace sat at the bottom of the lake.
 The Ultimate God of Punishment looked at the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit and asked, “Is it the Heavenly Dao’s Divine Might Heavenly Sage?”
 The Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit said, “That’s right. He’s indeed very strong. As expected of the Chaotic Fiendcelestial’s potential. He’s even stronger than Pangu back then.”
 “Are you really confident in dealing with him?”
 The Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit stared at him and said, “Of course I’m confident. He’s indeed powerful, but he’s not my match.”
 The Ultimate God of Punishment hesitated for a moment and then asked, “Can you let him live and create a great cause together?”
 The Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit was silent.
 The Ultimate God of Punishment said, “If you want to break the old situation of the Chaos and reconstruct the rules, you and I alone might not be able to succeed. Didn’t you say that a mysterious existence above the Chaos is spying on it?
 “We don’t even know what that is. It’s enough to show the difference between us. He might even control the power of the seven Supreme Divine Authorities. We can be more confident with the Divine Might Heavenly Sage’s help.”
 The Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit said faintly, “If you can persuade him, you can naturally do it. However, I will definitely make his cultivation go to ruin if he wants to defend the Heavenly Dao.”
 The Ultimate God of Punishment fell silent.
 Time passed quickly.
 Another hundred thousand years passed.
 The calamity of the Ancient Desolate did not spread in the Chaos. Only a few people knew.
  Han Jue opened his eyes and felt the increase in his cultivation. He smiled in satisfaction.
 It was difficult for the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit not to die with the Ultimate Origin Fiendcelestial’s talent!
 Han Jue first checked his interpersonal relationships. He was relieved after confirming that the portraits of Dao Sovereign and the other two were still there.
 Then, he sent a dream to the Ultimate God of Punishment.
 A few years ago, the Ultimate God of Punishment had sent him a dream and he had ignored it since he was busy cultivating.
 His principles could not be broken!
 In the dream.
 The Ultimate God of Punishment opened his eyes and sighed when he saw Han Jue.
 What a domineering method. He actually did not sense it.
 It would be too terrifying if such a method could kill the enemy.
