 Boom
 The endless void exploded like a spatial bell, trembling and echoing.
 Jiang Jueshi and Dao Sovereign’s figures interwove crazily. They kept using their Mystical Powers. Dharmic powers and divine light stretched through the void. All sorts of Dharma Idols appeared, causing the void to seem like a world evolving faster.
 They used the Divine Might Great Heaven Palm at the same time to destroy all the other party’s Dharma Idols, but they couldn’t hurt the other party.
 “I didn’t expect Master to also teach him…”
 This thought appeared in their minds.
 Although their cultivation levels were already powerful, none of their Mystical Powers had greater destructive power than the Divine Might Great Heaven Palm.
 The power of the Divine Might Great Heaven Palm also caused a discussion among the mighty figures in the hall.
 “Is this the Mystical Power that the Heavenly Sage used against the prodigies?”
 “It looks ordinary, but its destructive power is truly terrifying.”
 “The Hidden Sect’s lineage will be indestructible with this Mystical Power.”
 “These two are both impressive. They can dominate an area.”
 It was not only the discussion in the hall. The entire Ten Absolute City was also bustling with noise and exclamations.
 Han Huang frowned. Logically speaking, he naturally hoped that Jiang Jueshi could win, as he did not understand Dao Sovereign.
 He knew Jiang Jueshi’s strength well. He didn’t expect there to be an existence in the Hidden Sect who could resist him.
 He looked around. Were these Chaotic Fiendcelestials all so strong?
 He suddenly couldn’t understand.
 “No wonder Father is so calm about my improvement…”
 Han Huang felt ashamed. What was his father thinking when he showed off to him?
 “They’re getting serious!” Zhao Xuanyuan suddenly said excitedly.
 Jiang Yi also looked expectant.
 All the disciples knew that the three of them were inseparable. Seeing their expressions, they couldn’t help but be curious about the strength that Dao Sovereign would display.
 Azure Heaven Mystic stared at Dao Sovereign in the sky, his heart beating faster.
 That was…
 A meandering river condensed around Dao Sovereign and occupied more than half of the void. He was like dust in the huge waves, extremely tiny. His aura soared as the river appeared, causing the void to change color.
 Jiang Jueshi was moved.
 “What is this?”
 This was the first time Jiang Jueshi had encountered such a power. Not daring to be careless, he immediately used his Great Creation, the Great Reincarnation Creation Technique!
 Divine light burst out from his body. Creation halos rose from his feet and expanded. His aura increased.
 “Junior Jiang, I’m sorry. I’m not only giving Junior Huang pressure. I’m definitely taking this top position!”
 Dao Sovereign laughed wantonly. The meandering river stirred up a huge wave a hundred million feet tall. Countless shadows rushed out from the waves and shouted as they attacked Jiang Jueshi.
 Someone in the hall exclaimed, “The River of Destiny?”
 The other mighty figures were in an uproar. Dao Sovereign could actually control the Chaotic River of Destiny?
 The Chaotic River of Destiny had been established for countless years. The power of karma it contained was unimaginable.
 The shadows in the waves were the shadows of cultivators since ancient times. There were so many of them.
 Jiang Jueshi raised his arms and circulated the Great Reincarnation Creation Technique crazily. Nine Dharma Idols that were identical to him rose above his head and waved the Divine Might Great Heaven Palm in all directions.
 Boom! Boom! Boom…
 The waves of destiny that came from all directions were dispersed one after another, but the River of Destiny was endless and could not be stopped by a few palms.
 Jiang Jueshi felt unprecedented pressure. This pressure was even greater than when he faced Han Huang. Although Han Huang could defeat him, that was the difference in Dharmic powers.
 “The River of Destiny…” Han Ling muttered to herself as she grabbed her sleeve.
 She was thinking about how her Emperor Soldiers would collide with the River of Destiny.
 Han Jue was also a little surprised. Dao Sovereign was something.
 He originally thought that Jiang Jueshi would definitely win, but he did not expect a variable to appear.
 Even he felt that it was a variable, let alone the others. Jiang Jueshi was the Heavenly Court’s Divine General, after all. He had contributed greatly and was famous. Dao Sovereign had kept a low profile for millions of years. Very few people had heard of him before the Chaotic Assembly.
 A dark horse!
 “Junior Jiang, you’re really powerful. You have to know that Zhao Xuanyuan and Jiang Yi can’t stop me even if they join forces!”
 Dao Sovereign laughed loudly. His voice resounded throughout Ten Absolute City. Zhao Xuanyuan’s and Jiang Yi’s smiles froze.
 Damn it!
 Zhao Xuanyuan slapped the table and stood up. “Junior Jiang, beat this son of a b*tch!”
 The Black Hell Chicken smiled. “Come on. Jiang Jueshi shouldn’t be able to win.”
 Zhao Xuanyuan was even more furious.
 “No!”
 Chu Shiren’s voice suddenly sounded. Everyone looked at the sky. The surging waves of the Chaotic River of Destiny parted on both sides. Jiang Jueshi, who was covered in divine light, stepped out. His figure grew several times taller with every step he took. The rings of light constantly surged into his body. Strange and mysterious golden runes began to appear around his body. They looked like words and patterns.
 Jiang Jueshi’s long hair fluttered as it lost its black color from the divine light. His eyes lost their pupils, and a black circle appeared between his eyebrows. Wisps of black aura overflowed and continued to strengthen like raging flames.
 Jiang Jueshi’s robes fluttered as his aura increased again.
 He waved his right hand, and the golden runes around him attacked like a tornado. The black circle between his eyebrows overflowed with a black aura and became the center of the tornado. It was like a black sword Qi that pressed forward and dispersed the Chaotic River of Destiny. It was unstoppable.
 Dao Sovereign’s expression changed slightly. He immediately formed a seal, and two divine weapons flew out from the River of Destiny on both sides. They were like halberds, one black and one white. They crossed ten thousand feet away and blocked Jiang Jueshi’s Great Creation Mystical Power.
 The black and white halberds trembled violently. The sound produced by the collision was deafening and extremely ear-piercing.
 In a flash, the black and white halberds suddenly fused together. A terrifying force erupted and dispersed Jiang Jueshi’s Great Creation Mystical Power, causing the void to shake violently.
 “Oh no!”
 The Ultimate God of Punishment suddenly disappeared from the hall and appeared in the void of the battle, using his Dharmic powers to stabilize the space.
 His appearance caused an uproar in Ten Absolute City.
 The battle between the two could actually break the power of rules set by the Ultimate God of Punishment?


 The Ultimate God of Punishment’s appearance made Jiang Jueshi and Dao Sovereign stop. They looked at him.
 “Continue fighting. I will stabilize this space so you can fight to your heart’s content,” the Ultimate God of Punishment said expressionlessly as a storm brewed in his heart. These two were only Great Dao Sages, but they had such strength. In the future, when they attained the Great Dao Supreme, they would have the right to reach the top of the Chaos.
 These words offended Yang Tiandong, Su Qi, Long Hao, Fang Liang, Xun Chang’an, and the other disciples.
 Jiang Jueshi smiled and nodded before attacking again.
 He continued to walk forward. His right hand kept casting spells. The golden runes around him flowed with light and kept attacking Dao Sovereign.
 No matter where he attacked, the black and white halberd would block in time. It moved extremely quickly and left behind afterimages. At first glance, it seemed to form a huge circle to protect Dao Sovereign.
 Dao Sovereign did wait for death. He smiled to himself and said, “In that case, I’ll be ruthless and let you know that my ten million years of danger was not nonsense!
 “Master, watch carefully. Who is your most outstanding disciple?!”
 Dao Sovereign raised his right arm. His arm was straight and his palm was clenched into a fist. The endless Chaotic River of Destiny quickly surged over and drowned him.
 At this moment, Jiang Jueshi had already reached a million feet tall. The light on his body was already very dazzling, like a god who had just awakened the Chaos. He was high and mighty.
 At this moment, Jiang Jueshi’s aura had already reached its peak. Countless living beings could feel his invincible aura even separated by the sky. “How powerful. Is this the peerless prodigy of the Hidden Sect?”
 “They want to fight for the Eternal Peak!”
 “It’s indeed impressive to force the leader of the Divine Spirits to personally protect them.”
 “I suddenly feel that it makes sense that I’ve stopped before the Thousand Lords…”
 “Jiang Jueshi has the aura of an unparalleled expert.”
 Han Ling looked at her father and asked, “Father, who will win?”
 Han Jue said, “Jiang Jueshi is still lacking.”
 Damn!
 Why was Dao Sovereign so ferocious?
 Was su
 Han Jue was surprised. He could feel that Dao Sovereign was accumulating power. This power was already enough to overturn ordinary Great Dao Supremes.
 One had to know that Jiang Jueshi would be a Dao Creator in the future. How could Dao Sovereign win?
 Han Jue suddenly realized that he had never deduced Dao Sovereign’s future.
 The future fate had been changing. Could it be that ever since Dao Sovereign entered the Consciousnessless Great Dao World, his fate had also changed?
 Very likely.
 At this moment!
 The accumulated Chaotic River of Destiny suddenly exploded. A terrifying figure broke free from the waves and jumped out. He punched Jiang Jueshi’s body and pierced through his chest. Blood splattered through the air.
 Zhao Xuanyuan and Jiang Yi looked at each other and saw the shock in each other’s eyes.
 Destruction Authority General!
 Jiang Yi muttered, “Alright… This kid even hid it from his brothers…”
 Zhao Xuanyuan was also very unhappy.
 The others did not notice their emotions as they watched the battle nervously.
 The sudden attack pierced through Jiang Jueshi’s chest, but he did not panic at all. A spatial vortex appeared in his chest and crushed his arm. His chest recovered.
 The Destruction Authority General was about to continue attacking when an invisible force forced him back. Just as he stabilized himself, the Destruction Authority General exploded and vanished.
 On the other hand, Jiang Jueshi was still so majestic and showed no signs of injury.
 Jiang Jueshi was about to continue forward when he suddenly felt something and suddenly turned around. He saw that Dao Sovereign had unknowingly appeared behind him. He held the black and white halberd in both hands and slashed out. The sound of the halberd colliding was extremely ear-piercing, as if it contained some kind of magic. Even Jiang Jueshi was stunned.
 The situation suddenly changed!
 Boom
 The black and white halberd emitted a terrifying black wind and white blades that swept through the entire void. The Ultimate God of Punishment’s armor trembled and his cloak fluttered behind him.
 Facing this violent attack, Jiang Jueshi had just recovered when his body had already transformed into a flying star, leaving only his head. His eyes widened as he looked at Dao Sovereign with a hint of shock.
 Dao Sovereign was expressionless. He threw out his two halberds and surrounded Jiang Jueshi’s head. Black lightning erupted along the halberd blade and interwove into a lightning net to trap him.
 Jiang Jueshi condensed and recovered his body. Countless bolts of lightning interwove on his body, causing him extreme pain. He had no choice but to use the power of creation to block.
 Dao Sovereign leaped up. Thunderclouds had unknowingly appeared above him and hung high above his head.
 After entering the thundercloud, it surged violently. It was vast and boundless, as if it covered the entire Chaos.
 Whoosh
 The thunderclouds suddenly burst open and a Destruction Authority General that was dozens of times more majestic than before appeared. The ten-million-foot-tall Jiang Jueshi was inferior to an eyeball of the Destruction Authority General.
 The Destruction Authority General punched down. Space collapsed and the bottom of the Chaos shook like an earthquake.
 In the blink of an eye, all the living beings in Ten Absolute City only felt the sky flash before the two sides collided again.
 Zhao Xuanyuan swallowed. “Not bad. Junior Jiang is really fierce.”
 Zhao Shuangquan and Azure Heaven Mystic were a little stunned.
 Ji Xianshen stood beside Azure Heaven Mystic and sighed. “If you can obtain the Eternal Peak now, what’s the point of this Chaos to
 you?”
 Azure Heaven Mystic came back to his senses and nodded heavily. He stared at the sky with a burning gaze.
 The strong light in the sky dissipated. The thundercloud had already dissipated. Dao Sovereign stood proudly in the void looking down at Jiang Jueshi.
 Jiang Jueshi was no longer ten million feet tall. Only his soul was left. His body was still surrounded by black lightning, and he could not move.
 He stared at Dao Sovereign and asked, “What was that just now?”
 Dao Sovereign looked down at him and said, “The Great Dao Providence Divine Authority. It is the power that surpasses the three thousand Great Dao.”
 With that, Jiang Jueshi’s soul dissipated like smoke.
 “The Hidden Sect’s Dao Sovereign defeated the Hidden Sect’s Jiang Jueshi!”
 Han Jue frowned and asked in his mind, “I want to know the state of Dao Sovereign when he is strongest in the future.”
 [5 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Wow!
 Five times the value of a Dao Creator!
 Continue!
 Han Jue wanted to see how strong the future Dao Sovereign was.


 Han Jue’s consciousness entered the illusion after he chose to continue.
 He opened his eyes and saw a cliff ahead. On the other side of the cliff was an absolute blankness. It was endless, as if it was the end of the world.
 He turned around and discovered an endless plain behind him. Countless Dao Seekers knelt on the ground, their foreheads touching the ground. They spread to the ends of the earth and were drowned by the endless Chaotic Qi.
 At a glance, there were at least ten million cultivators of all races. They all worshiped in the same direction, a blank domain.
 What were they doing?
 Waiting for the future Dao Sovereign to descend?
 Han Jue found it strange.
 At this moment, the cultivator closest to the cliff looked up. Han Jue had seen him before.
 Previously, when the million Great Dao Sages surrounded him, this person was among them. He seemed to be a Great Dao Divine Spirit. At that time, his cultivation was already not far from the Great Dao Supreme Realm.
 a
 “Ancient Great Dao Sovereign, if you are still around, please show your divinity. The dilapidated Chaos is facing danger again. We Great Dao Sages are ashamed and unable to defeat you. We hope that you can help…”
 The Great Dao Divine Spirit wailed as he knelt.
 Han Jue had a strange expression. Why would the Great Dao Divine Spirit make such a gesture?
 Broken Chaos…
 Could this be the future after the Chaos was overthrown?
 At this moment, two domineering auras came from the depths of the blank domain, far beyond the Great Dao Supreme.
 Han Jue turned around and saw a terrifying figure rising from the cliff. It was a figure emitting a dazzling silver light. Han Jue and the ten million cultivators looked extremely tiny in front of him, even smaller than dust.
 Han Jue couldn’t see his appearance clearly. He saw a pair of eyes appear above the terrifying figure. They were extremely cold, and flames burned beside his eyes. There was a space between the two.
 For some reason, Han Jue felt that they were like Jiang Yi and Zhao Xuanyuan.
 The Great Dao Divine Spirit said excitedly when he saw them, “Two Supremacies, will the Great Dao Sovereign agree?”
 An ancient and cold voice sounded. “The Great Dao Sovereign is listening to the Dao in front of the Lord. Leave the matter of the Chaos to us.”
 Lord?
 Creator Lord?
 This was the only possibility.
 He had no reason to be at the same realm as Dao Sovereign!
 “But the other party is the master of a Great Dao World. His cultivation level surpasses the Great Dao Supreme and he threatened to challenge the Great Dao Supreme. Otherwise, the Chaos will be destroyed!” the Great Dao Divine Spirit said excitedly, his tone filled with pleading
 In his era, the Great Dao Divine Spirits were still very impressive.
 It seemed that many Great Dao Worlds appeared after the Chaos was destroyed.
 Tsk tsk, I’m really impressive. I raised the upper limit of the Chaos alone.
 To overthrow the Chaos, one had to have the strength that surpassed the Ninth Chaos.
 In the entire Chaos, Han Jue felt that only he was qualified, so all the credit fell on him.
 The ancient and cold voice sounded, “I said, leave this matter to us. That Great Dao World Lord is indeed powerful, but he was once of the same generation as us. We can naturally defeat him!”
 The illusion shattered.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and frowned.
 What was this?
 He had not even seen Dao Sovereign. How could this be his strongest state?
 Han Jue felt cheated.
 At this moment! A line of words suddenly appeared in front of him.
 [Dao Sovereign: Mid-stage Dao Creator, Master of the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority, personal disciple of the Creator Lord, Great Dao Sovereign. Because he contributed greatly to the promotion of the Endless Era, he was given the title of Great Dao Sovereign by the Creator Lord. He oversees all the Great Dao Worlds.]
 Amazing!
 Was this the future Dao Sovereign?
 How domineering!
 Han Jue secretly asked, “Am I the Creator Lord here?”
 [Karma can change at any time. You can’t predict yourself. You can only guess.]
 Hmph.
 How useless.
 “Father, did Senior Jiang’s failure make you unhappy?” Han Ling suddenly asked.
 Han Jue relaxed his eyebrows and smiled. “No, I just thought of something about cultivation.”
 Han Ling was no longer puzzled.
 At this moment, the hall was still discussing Dao Sovereign.
 Dao Sovereign was definitely the greatest dark horse in the Chaotic Assembly. Many mighty figures thought that he had a chance to obtain the Eternal Peak.
 The battle space in the sky had already changed to a pair of geniuses. One of them was the Chaotic Fiendcelestial of the Hidden Sect.
 The discussions in Ten Absolute City revolved around the Hidden Sect.
 “Tsk tsk, the Hidden Sect’s Dao Sovereign defeated the Hidden Sect’s Jiang Jueshi. The Hidden Sect has so many peerless geniuses.”
 “Will the Hidden Sect occupy all the spots of the Ten Absolutes?”
 “Not really. Formless World can at least obtain one spot or even the Eternal Peak. As long as he succeeds, the remaining nine will all be from the Hidden Sect. It will only make him stronger.”
 “The Hidden Sect is indeed powerful. Why are there so many Chaotic Fiendcelestials?”.
 “Junior, don’t you know? A long time ago, the previous leader of the Divine Spirits controlled the Divine Authority Generals to slaughter the Chaotic Fiendcelestials. It was the Divine Might Heavenly Sage who saved them. It’s normal for so many Chaotic Fiendcelestials to acknowledge him as their master.”
 “When I think of how Jiang Jueshi and Dao Sovereign couldn’t even withstand a single strike from the Divine Might Heavenly Sage, I worship him.”
 This battle became a stalemate. The scene was still very magnificent, but it was much inferior to the previous battle. Especially after time passed, it was impossible to highlight the strength of one of them.
 In the courtyard.
 Dao Sovereign was in high spirits and was surrounded by his fellow disciples.
 Jiang Jueshi was not depressed. He only looked at Dao Sovereign in a daze.
 Han Huang walked over and patted his shoulder. “It’s fine. I’ll defeat him for you!”
 Jiang Jueshi shook his head and smiled. “I’m fine. I just thought of something Master
 said.”
 “What is it?”
 Han Huang was curious. Jiang Jueshi could actually smile.
 Han Huang was silent.
 The Black Hell Chicken walked past and smiled proudly. “That’s right. Actually, I lost on purpose. After all, my seniority is high. It won’t look good if I defeat you. Therefore, before I met you again, I directly admitted defeat.”
 The Chaotic Heavenly Dog followed behind him and shouted, “Brother Chicken is invincible.”
 Jiang Jueshi laughed, while Han Huang was speechless.
 Han Qing’er smiled and said, “Senior Brother Jiang is already very strong, okay? After all, Senior Brother Dao has been under my father for longer. When the next Chaotic Assembly begins, Senior Brother Jiang will definitely be able to dominate.”
 There was a high chance that the Ten Absolutes would no longer participate in the next Chaotic Assembly. They had already proved themselves.
 The Eternal Peak was strictly forbidden from participating again.
 The battle in the sky lasted for several hours. In the end, the Chaotic Fiendcelestial of the Hidden Sect was still defeated. There was no legend of the Hidden Sect being undefeated in the battle of the Hundred Sovereigns.
 Han Jue felt that it was normal. Those who could reach this point were all geniuses.
 He could only pray that the Hidden Sect disciples would not bump into each other.
 However, good times did not last!
 The next battle was, Zhao Xuanyuan VS Chu Shiren!


 However, the truth surprised Han Jue again. Chu Shiren actually won.
 Zhao Xuanyuan’s Great Dao Providence Divine Authority was clearly inferior to Dao Sovereign’s, and Chu Shiren’s Buddhist Dharma had already reached the Great Dao Realm. Although he was at the early-stage Great Dao Sage Realm, his Dharmic powers were like the late-stage Great Dao Sage Realm. It was quite magical.
 The battle continued.
 In the future, Hidden Sect disciples would appear every two rounds at most. The spectators in Ten Ultimate City sighed.
 If not for the Chaotic Assembly, how long would the Hidden Sect have hidden its strength?
 Han Ling was also shocked. How did her father gather so many geniuses?
 The Hidden Sect occupied more than twenty spots among the top hundred geniuses in the Chaos…
 Han Ling looked at her father. Han Jue’s expression was calm as he stared at the sky in a daze.
 Half a month later.
 There were 25 geniuses left. One of them was left out. Zhao Shuangquan was lucky to obtain this spot.
 After that, the chances of Hidden Sect disciples meeting each other increased.
 Guan Bubai fought the Flesh Fiendcelestial and won.
 Li Yao fought the Nine Yin Fiendcelestial and
 won.
 The Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial fought Jiang Yi and won.
 In the courtyard of Ten Absolute City.
 Zhao Xuanyuan, Jiang Yi, and Lao Dan surrounded Dao Sovereign. Not far away, the other Hidden Sect disciples were looking up at the sky to watch the battle.
 “Tsk tsk, I didn’t expect that only you of the three brothers could survive until the Ten Absolutes.”
 Unexpectedly…
 Zhao Xuanyuan and Jiang Yi were also very depressed.
 Dao Sovereign smiled. “That’s normal. After all, Master has always taken good care of his disciples. As his cultivation level continues to break through, the Spirit Qi in the Dao Field will also increase. Sometimes, he will even preach the Dao. Even a dog or chicken can ascend to the heavens.”
 Two pairs of eyes landed on him, but he ignored them.
 Lao Dan looked at the Great Dao Sages of the Hidden Sect and sighed. “In this Ten Absolutes, the Hidden Sect will occupy half of the spots.”
 He suddenly felt that Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du was really wise.
 Having Han Jue as a backing was much more promising than staying in the Human School. The battle for the Ten Absolutes continued.
 Ten Absolute City had already begun to make all sorts of predictions about the Eternal Peak. There were even gambling dens.
 Formless World was too strong. Every battle ended very quickly. Most importantly, the opponent couldn’t touch him at all.
 Han Huang and Dao Sovereign were ranked second and third.
 On the other side.
 At the edge of the Chaos, a rolling black aura surged in the boundless mist. The scene zoomed in, and one could see that the black aura came from dozens of pits in the ground, like smoke spilling out of a volcano.
 The black aura surged violently, and a figure could be vaguely seen floating inside.
 The figure expanded at a speed visible to the naked eye. Soon, it was like a mountain giant hidden in the black mist.
 “Chaos… It’s time to overthrow it…”
 A hoarse voice slowly sounded, its tone filled with terrifying hatred.
 In the hall, the mighty figures were discussing a name, Murong Qi.
 Han Jue was very satisfied with Murong Qi’s performance. He discovered that many disciples had given him a surprise.
 After another battle, there were only 13 people left in the Chaotic Assembly. Among them, Zhao Shuangquan got a free pass.
 The last battle was not an internal fight of the Hidden Sect. It lasted for half a day.
 Now, there were twelve victors. Seven of them were from the Hidden Sect. They were Han Huang, Dao Sovereign, Guan Bubai, Chu Shiren, Li Yao, Murong Qi, and the Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial.
 Including Zhao Shuangquan, there were a total of eight of them. The terrifying dominance made the various factions tremble.
 They had witnessed every battle with their own eyes and knew that the strength of the eight Hidden Sect disciples was not exaggerated. The Ultimate God of Punishment did not deliberately side with the Hidden Sect. Otherwise, the number of internal conflicts in the Hidden Sect would decrease greatly. Almost all of the eight Hidden Sect disciples who stood out stepped on their fellow disciples to ascend.
 The Ultimate God of Punishment’s voice resounded throughout the city, causing all living beings to discuss intensely.
 The three of them were all geniuses of the Hidden Sect. If they chose to challenge the other four geniuses who did not belong to the Hidden Sect and won…
 Nine out of ten were geniuses of the Hidden Sect?
 Gasp
 At this moment, countless living beings were shocked.
 The Ultimate God of Punishment waved his hand and moved the thirteen geniuses into the hall.
 The Ultimate God of Punishment said, “Zhao Shuangquan, Li Yao, Chu Shiren, the three of you can choose your opponents.”
 The three of them looked at each other and hesitated.
 From the looks of it, they should not challenge their fellow disciples, but the remaining four had ridiculously high cultivation levels. The weakest was at the late-stage Great Dao Sage Realm, and two of them had even reached the Great Dao Supreme Realm.
 Whoever faced them would die!
 Han Jue said, “Choose according to your heart. At this point, you should think for yourself.”
 The three of them heaved a sigh of relief. The mighty figures also quietened down. Only they knew what they were thinking.
 “Senior Guan, I challenge you!”
 Zhao Shuangquan took a step forward and pointed at Guan Bubai.
 Guan Bubai raised his eyebrows and was secretly unhappy. They treated him as the weakest!
 He didn’t say anything and just nodded proudly.
 The Ultimate God of Punishment immediately sent the two of them into the battle space.
 The battle was about to begin.
 Han Ling asked, “Father, who do you think will win?”
 Han Jue shook his head and didn’t say anything
 From his cultivation and performance, Guan Bubai was more than a little stronger than Zhao Shuangquan.
 However, he couldn’t stop Zhao Shuangquan from cheating
 With Zhao Shuangquan’s cultivation level that had just attained the Great Dao Sage Realm, he should not even be able to advance to this stage. However, this fellow had won all the way and had turned the tables many times.
 Others didn’t know Zhao Shuangquan’s background, but Han Jue knew that this was the true strongest brother.
 Zhao Shuangquan was suppressed by Guan Bubai the moment the battle began.
 Guan Bubai was the Unbeatable Fiendcelestial. He relied on his Unbeatable Dao heart and used his full strength.
 Zhao Shuangquan’s Mystical Power was impressive and exquisite. Unfortunately, he couldn’t defeat Guan Bubai.
 Five minutes later.
 Guan Bubai smiled in satisfaction.
 He didn’t care about Zhao Shuangquan’s indignant gaze.
 Han Jue secretly thought that Guan Bubai would probably be pestered by Zhao Shuangquan in the future.


 Guan Bubai defeated Zhao Shuangquan and became the first genius of the Ten Absolutes!
 Li Yao did not choose someone from the Hidden Sect. His name was the Universe Sage
 King.
 Li Yao had always been thought of by the Hidden Sect disciples as the female version of Han Jue. She cultivated diligently all year round and her cultivation level was considered the top among the personal disciples. She was naturally not bad.
 Her Sword Dao had already reached greater mastery and had its own realm. As for the Universe Sage King, he was also powerful and had perfected Great Dao Sage cultivation. Their battle was very exciting, and it was temporarily difficult to tell who was stronger.
 In the courtyard of Ten Absolute City.
 Zhao Shuangquan’s expression was ashamed as he faced Su Qi.
 Su Qi consoled him. “It’s fine. You’ve already tried your best. Your results make me very glad.”
 Azure Heaven Mystic snorted. “That’s right. You’ve at least touched the threshold of the Ten Absolutes. You’re really lucky.”
 He was also eliminated and felt extremely depressed.
 Zhao Shuangquan glanced around. The courtyard was filled with losers. His mood improved.
 Yi Tian cursed. “Stop being depressed. I’m the one who’s depressed. The damned Formless World blocked my entrance to the Ten Absolutes.”
 Everyone fell silent at the mention of Formless World.
 Their gazes landed on Han Tuo, who sat under the tree and looked at the sky in silence.
 Yi Tian wasn’t the only one who lost to Formless World. Han Tuo was the same.
 Everyone looked at Han Tuo and sighed.
 With Han Tuo’s cultivation, not to mention the Eternal Peak, obtaining the Ten Absolutes was nothing difficult. He never expected to encounter Formless World.
 Several hours later.
 Li Yao was still defeated. The Universe Sage King was indeed powerful. Han Jue could tell that he already had the preliminary idea of creating his own Great Dao World. He used the power of the Great World to suppress Li Yao’s Sword Dao and won openly.
 Perhaps because he knew Li Yao’s identity, the Universe Sage King did not defeat her into a sorry state. He stopped and ended it with a bow.
 The Universe Sage King’s appearance made Han Jue realize that many Great Dao Sages in the Chaos already had the thoughts of creating their own Great Dao Worlds. However, they were still exploring. The successful ones were probably suppressed by the Ninth Chaos, so their cultivation of the Great Dao World was isolated.
 After the Universe Sage King reached the Ten Absolutes, the third battle continued.
 Chu Shiren stood up and chose not to fight with his fellow disciples. He challenged a prodigy called Zhou Song’s Great Dao Heaven.
 Han Jue showed a frown.
 On the surface, Zhou Song’s Great Dao Heaven cultivation was at the perfected Great Dao Sage Realm, but in fact, he was at the Great Dao Supreme Realm.
 Han Jue couldn’t remind him about this. It was just a spar, not a life and death battle.
 The battle began. Zhou Song’s Great Dao Heaven was abnormal. It was not like before when he would test the waters. He directly used his full strength.
 Chu Shiren clearly did not expect Zhou Song’s Great Dao Heaven to be so powerful.
 Zhou Song’s Great Dao Heaven also had the trend of establishing a Great Dao World. He was not the only one. Chu Shiren had actually established another Buddhist World in the depths of his soul.
 The battle of the embryonic Great Dao World!
 Han Jue sighed.
 As expected of prodigies, they had already begun to touch a higher realm of Dao attainment.
 Amazing
 The more Chu Shiren fought, the more shocked he became. He had relied on the power of the Buddhist World to be invincible. He had killed his way to this point. He did not expect the Ten Absolutes to have such power!
 After a fierce battle, Chu Shiren was still defeated because of the difference in cultivation.
 At this point, the top ten were decided!
 They were:
 Han Huang, Dao Sovereign, Guan Bubai, Murong Qi, Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial, Huang Zuntian, Formless World, Great Heaven God King, Universe Sage King, and Zhou Song’s Great Dao Heaven.
 The Ultimate God of Punishment personally announced these ten names. His voice resounded throughout Ten Absolute City, causing the entire city to cheer and shout.
 “The battle for the Eternal Peak will happen in a month. I will make adjustments and prepare to put the ten geniuses into a certain domain together. The one who survives until the end will be the Eternal Peak!”
 The Ultimate God of Punishment’s voice resounded throughout the entire Ten Absolute City, causing an uproar.
 The mighty figures in the hall were also stunned. Didn’t they agree to fight one-on-one?
 Han Jue glanced at the Ultimate God and frowned.
 This rule was too friendly to the Hidden Sect.
 It was just a sudden change in the rules. What would the Chaos think of the Hidden Sect?
 Didn’t the Ultimate God of Punishment have a max favorability? Why did he do such a thing? The Ultimate God of Punishment said, “This rule has actually been set for a long time, but I’ve never said it. This is the reason why I organized the Chaotic Assembly. What I want is not for the geniuses to fight for supremacy, but to get to know each other and motivate each other. In the past, the Chaos was endless and the various domains did not interfere with each other. The Chaotic Void was desolate. Do you really think such a Chaos has a future?”
 These words only sounded in the hall. Ten Absolute City was still arguing about the new rules. Public opinion was extremely bad for the Hidden Sect.
 The Ten Absolutes were also in the hall. They listened carefully, wanting to hear the Ultimate God’s explanation.
 “Let me talk about my past first. A long time ago, I was as high-spirited as the prodigies in the hall. I believe some ancient existences should know that I was later suppressed by the previous leader of the Divine Spirits, just like Pangu and the Dao Ancestor in the past. However, the place where I was suppressed was this place, the bottom of the Chaos.
 “There are countless ghosts here. Hatred is overflowing. I’ve also been lost and wanted to take revenge on the Chaos. Later, I suddenly realized that what I should hate is not the Chaos, but the order of the Chaos.
 “In the years that I was suppressed, I discovered that the bottom of the Chaos is not the true bottom.”
 The Ultimate God of Punishment stopped here.
