Qingluan’er knew that it was not as simple as fighting upon seeing her daughter’s expression. She glared at him.
Han Jue felt a little awkward under her gaze and said, “I want Qing’er to participate in the Chaotic Assembly, so I’m being stricter.”
Chaotic Assembly?
Qingluan’er and Han Qing’er were both interested.
Han Jue didn’t hide anything. After all, Han Qing’er had already attained the Dao. There was no benefit in hiding anymore. Instead, it would attract unnecessary consequences.
He only mentioned the information regarding the Chaotic Assembly and introduced the Great Dao Divine Spirits. He did not mention the rest.
Han Qing’er had heard of the Chaotic Assembly in the Universal Hall. She didn’t expect it to be so exciting and grand.
She immediately became excited. “I want to participate! I want to participate!”
Han Qing’er seemed humiliated upon hearing this. She said indignantly, “Mother, you underestimate me!
“Besides, the Chaotic Assembly is being jointly held by Father and the leader of the Divine Spirits. Who dares to kill me?”
Then, Qingluan’er looked at her father in surprise.
Han Jue said seriously, “Don’t think like that. You might really die. Justice will be lost if the Chaotic Assembly is corrupted by the higher-ups. You have to be prepared to die as long as you want to participate!” Han Qing’er was silent.
Qingluan’er hurriedly dissuaded her.
“No, I want to participate. I’m my father’s daughter. How can I be mediocre? My elder brother can wander around and make a name for himself. Why can’t I? Also, my second brother is not even born yet and has been nurtured for millions of years. What talent is this? Mother, my second brother will definitely shock the world when he’s born. Do you want me to be the weakest in our family?” Han Qing’er said seriously. Her stubborn and strong-minded appearance was quite similar to Han Jue’s.
Qingluan’er said, “Silly child, if aren’t you the weakest, who will be? You’re the youngest, after all.”
Han Qing’er immediately felt defeated.
Han Jue was amused. This mother and daughter always bickered like sisters.
Back then, Qingluan’er doted on Han Tuo in every way and had never said anything to attack him. Of course, their mother-son relationship was not as close as the mother-daughter relationship.
“Alright, prepare to listen to the Dao,” Han Jue waved his sleeve and said. This sentence also entered the ears of all the disciples in the third Dao Field.
Everyone excitedly gathered.
On the barren star.
Jiang Jueshi and Liu Bei sat on the cliff.
Jiang Jueshi opened his eyes and exhaled.
Liu Bei did not open his eyes. “What’s wrong?”
Liu Bei opened his eyes and stared at him. He pondered for a moment and said, “Your Great Reincarnation Creation Technique is endless and profound, but it didn’t create a Great Dao that belongs to you alone. Cultivation is based on the Great Dao after attaining the Dao. How can you cultivate without the Great Dao?”
Jiang Jueshi said helplessly, “How can the Great Dao be so easy to create?”
Liu Bei hesitated for a moment and asked, “Should I ask that senior?”
Jiang Jueshi narrowed his eyes.
That senior was the hidden mighty figure in this universe.
Because of his experience in the Human School, Jiang Jueshi was very resistant to joining others. However, he also knew that he had to have a backing if he wanted to cultivate in the Chaos.
How strong one’s backing determined the distance one could walk.
“You don’t have to worry. That senior doesn’t need you to risk your life. Besides, you’re not qualified. He’s even stronger than ordinary Great Dao Divine Spirits in the Chaos.” Liu Bei shook his head and smiled.
Jiang Jueshi was moved. “So powerful?”
A Great Dao Divine Spirit was almost equivalent to a Great Dao Sage!
Liu Bei nodded.
Jiang Jueshi struggled for a moment before finally agreeing.
Liu Bei immediately closed his eyes and sent a voice transmission to the third Dao Field.
Han Jue immediately replied, “Let him continue cultivating and wait for my seclusion to end.”
Liu Bei told him the truth. Jiang Jueshi nodded and heaved a sigh of relief.
The other party was mainly in seclusion, which meant that he did not care about him that much. Thus, he wouldn’t scheme against him.
Jiang Jueshi glanced at Liu Bei gratefully. The latter had given him a residence and a huge opportunity. Such a good brother was rare in
life.
Han Jue left quietly and returned to the Daoist temple to continue cultivating.
As for Jiang Jueshi, he would wait for a while to prevent this kid from suspecting anything.
Another hundred thousand years passed just like that.
Jiang Jueshi was already anxious. He asked Liu Bei again, “How long will that senior be in seclusion?”
Liu Bei opened his eyes and said helplessly, “How would I know?”
Jiang Jueshi sighed.
He had been looking forward to it ever since he started thinking about this, but the other party did not appear.
He had thought that the other party was after his talent. But it was ridiculous now that he thought about it. In the eyes of mighty figures, he was probably inferior to Liu Bei.
Talent was only potential. Cultivation was the true capital.
“How can the path of cultivation be impatient? You endured hundreds of thousands of reincarnations. Why did your personality change after stopping?” a voice floated over, startling the two of them. A figure stood on the hill behind. His entire body shone with divine light, making it impossible to see his true appearance.
Liu Bei immediately knelt. Jiang Jueshi understood that the other party was the mighty figure Liu Bei had mentioned.
However…
How does he know about my past?
Jiang Jueshi panicked.
Han Jue chuckled and said, “I know what you’re thinking. It will be as easy as flipping your palm to see through a person’s past and future when you attain the Great Dao. Your experience might be unique in the Heavenly Dao, but it’s nothing in the Chaos.”
Jiang Jueshi took a deep breath and bowed. “I was rude earlier. Senior, please forgive me.”
“My Great Dao contains the principles of the three thousand Great Dao. Are you willing to cultivate it?” Han Jue asked. He had already used the Supreme Power to isolate the universe of stars. No one could spy on him.
Perhaps only a Dao Creator could.
It should not be surprising in the eyes of a Dao Creator.
Jiang Jueshi hesitated.
Han Jue said, “Many people have already cultivated this Dao. There’s no lack of Great Dao Sages. You don’t have to worry. You can also listen to the Dao before making a decision.”
Jiang Jueshi nodded and hurriedly thanked him.
Han Jue began to preach. This lecture lasted for ten thousand years.
The lecture ended.
Jiang Jueshi slowly opened his eyes and looked at Han Jue with reverence.
What a profound Great Dao!


 “Thank you for your lecture, Senior. This Dao is indeed impressive. I’m willing to cultivate this Dao. Senior, please allow me!”
 Jiang Jueshi stood up and bowed sincerely.
 Han Jue said, “The previous lecture was already enough for you to cultivate for some time. I’ll guide you when you attain the Great Dao.”
 With that, he vanished.
 Jiang Jueshi was stunned. He didn’t expect the other party to leave so quickly.
 Liu Bei also came to a realization and smiled. “To be willing to take out ten thousand years to preach the Dao to you, it seems that this senior still thinks highly of you. I’ve never listened to the Dao for so long.”
 Jiang Jueshi was very happy and was no longer vigilant upon hearing this.
 
 Jiang Jueshi was no longer worried.
 He was so vigilant in the past because he was afraid that the other party would covet it.
 Then, the two of them continued to meditate and cultivate.
 …

 In a world, the forest rose and fell. The sky was high and the sea was far away. A majestic mountain towered into the clouds.
 At the top of the mountain was a huge peacock. It was even larger than the entire mountain. The surrounding sea of clouds looked small in front of it.
 A beam of light sped over and stopped in front of the huge peacock.
 A burly man in black armor and a phoenix-winged iron crown appeared after the light dissipated.
 The black-armored man cupped his fists and bowed. “Divine Lord, I learned that the Five Great Divine Punishers have entered the Ancient Desolate for some time.”
 The huge peacock was Divine Lord Peacock.
 Divine Lord Peacock slowly opened his eyes and asked, “What about the situation in the Ancient Desolate?”
 “There’s no movement for now. The phenomenon you mentioned has never appeared, either.”
 “Mm.”
 Divine Lord Peacock closed his eyes. It was unknown what he was thinking.
 The black-armored man couldn’t help but ask, “Divine Lord, what are you waiting for?”.
 Divine Lord Peacock said casually, “The Ancient Desolate contains a huge opportunity. Why did the Five Great Divine Punishers enter? It’s because the Ancient Desolate is powerful enough. I even suspect that the Dao Ancestor is hiding there.”
 The black-armored man nodded. “The Ancient Desolate was formed by the Dao Ancestor. The Dao Ancestor captured many experts and suppressed them in the Ancient Desolate in the past.”
 He paused and asked in surprise, “But you still didn’t say what you were waiting for.”
 Divine Lord Peacock opened his eyes and stared coldly at the black-armored man, scaring him so much that he hurriedly lowered his head.
 “Just to keep an eye on him. You’ll definitely benefit in the future,” Divine Lord Peacock said coldly, scaring the black-armored man so much that he hurriedly nodded.
 Then, the black-armored man bowed and left.
 Divine Lord Peacock stared in the direction he had left in deep thought.
 “Forbidden Lord, oh Forbidden Lord. I can only contribute like this if you don’t contact me,” Divine Lord Peacock thought helplessly.
 He thought that the Dark Forbidden Lord was dissatisfied with him. He had attained the Great Dao too slowly. Previously, he had even caused trouble and had to be personally saved by the Dark Forbidden Lord.
 Divine Lord Peacock’s eyes became firm.
 He had to obtain that treasure!
 Why would he worry about not being able to help the Dark Forbidden Lord after obtaining it?

 . Although Divine Lord Peacock did not know what the Dark Forbidden Lord’s great ambition was, it was definitely related to the entire Chaos.
 More than ten Sages gathered in the Universal Hall.
 Most Sages had their own responsibilities. It was very difficult for all of them to be in the Heavenly Dao at the same time.
 Cultivators were not afraid of being attacked by Sages and existences above with the Heavenly Dao’s protection. Although it was not absolutely safe, they could at least avoid many troubles.
 as
 Many Sages were moved at the mention of the Ancient Desolate.
 The Ancient Desolate was the most frequently mentioned in the Chaos.
 They each had their own forces. Many disciples wandered in the Chaos and naturally had this information. Even Sages already had their eyes on that Supreme Treasure.
 Pan Xin smiled. “Heavenly Venerate wants to snatch this treasure?”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du shook his head. “On the contrary, I want to remind you that you can’t go to the Ancient Desolate. Also, that Supreme Treasure can’t be stolen.”
 The new Sage, Yang Tiandong, couldn’t help but ask, “Why?”
 He had just attained the Dao and had swept away his previous depression. He was filled with motivation and wanted to achieve something, so he also targeted the Ancient Desolate.
 The other Sages also looked puzzled.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du replied, “I’ve calculated that the Ancient Desolate will cause a calamity. We might endanger the Heavenly Dao if we’re not careful.”
 Threaten the Heavenly Dao?
 The Sages were in an uproar.
 The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate chuckled. “Heavenly Venerate, isn’t this too exaggerated? Could there be thirty thousand Divine Authority Generals hidden in the Ancient Desolate?”
 The Sages also laughed.
Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates That’s right.
 How could the Heavenly Dao be in danger with the Divine Might Heavenly Sage around!
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “Everyone, don’t forget the Dao Ancestor. Pangu has revived. As for the Dao Ancestor, whose fate is unknown, are you sure he’s dead? Are you going to give way if the Dao Ancestor returns and wants to regain control of the Heavenly Dao?”
 The atmosphere in the hall was oppressive again when the Dao Ancestor was mentioned.
 The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate, Pan Xin, and Yang Tiandong stopped talking. Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du was about to speak when a great pressure descended from the sky. It was a pillar of light that pierced through the 33rd Heaven and landed in front of the Universal Hall. It passed through the layers of clouds and landed in a mortal world below the Immortal World.
 The Sages were shocked.
 “What’s that?”
 “What a terrifying pressure!”
 “It’s a Great Dao Sage!” “Wait, why did it fall from above?” “That pillar of light actually fell into a mortal body.”
  Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du frowned. He counted with his fingers and his expression changed drastically.
 He actually couldn’t deduce it. He even panicked. This was a feeling he had never felt before.
 What happened?
 Three figures appeared in the hall at this moment. They were Great Sage Void Soul, the Foolish Sword Sage, and Red Fate.
 “What was that just now?” the Foolish Sword Sage asked in a low voice. He was also shocked.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du frowned and asked, “You can’t deduce it, either?”
 The Foolish Sword Sage was the strongest existence in the Heavenly Dao other than the Divine Might Heavenly Sage!
 Red Fate also looked at the Foolish Sword Sage in surprise.
 The gazes of the Sages made the Foolish Sword Sage even more displeased.
 His eyes became colder as he turned to look at the mortal world.
 He was a Great Dao Supreme, but there was actually something he could not see through!


 While the Heavenly Dao Sage was shocked by the mysterious pillar of light, three lines of notifications appeared in front of Han Jue.
 [Detected that the Dao Creator’s power has entered the Chaos. You have the following choices:)
 (1: Go and destroy this power immediately and promote the dominance of the Primordial Fiendcelestial. You can obtain a Primordial Fragment, a Great Dao Fragment, a Creation Spirit Stone, a Heavenly Dao Spirit Stone, a Supreme Treasure, and the Dao Creator’s hatred.)
 [2: Cultivate in a low-profile manner and stay away from trouble. Avoid the attention of the Dao Creator for now. You can obtain a Primordial Fragment, a Great Dao Fragment, and a Creation Spirit Stone.)
 Dao Creator?
 Han Jue’s eyelids twitched.
 This was an existence he could not provoke.
 Although the reward for the first option was very generous, he could only choose the second option.
 Han Jue silently made his choice.
 
 (You chose to cultivate in a low-profile manner and stay away from trouble. You temporarily avoided the sharpness of the Dao Creator and obtained a Primordial Fragment, a Great Dao Fragment, and a Creation Spirit Stone.)
 Han Jue immediately took out the Creation Spirit Stone and chose a ball of Fiendcelestial Qi to fuse with.
 His will jumped above the Chaos and looked down at it, wanting to see where the power
 was.
 Soon, he was attracted by the Heavenly Dao.

 There was an extremely bright light in the Heavenly Dao. It was the brightest in the entire Chaos and was extremely eye-catching.
 Han Jue looked over. The light came from a mortal world. It was a child.
 The child was just born. His cries were loud and world-shattering. It was even more powerful than when Qin Ling was born. His cries shocked the entire world and terrified countless cultivators.
 Han Jue discovered that he couldn’t spy on this child. This child had a powerful force and there was a golden pattern between his eyebrows like a closed vertical eye.
 The powerful force came from the golden pattern.
 (1 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [Chaotic Consciousness: Cultivation unknown, Chaotic Deity, Above the Great Dao, Rules and Order, Unspeakable Name.)
 It was him!
 The first Dao Creator that Han Jue learned about!
 This fellow finally couldn’t take it anymore.
 Han Jue continued to ask, “Why is the Chaotic Consciousness doing this?”
 [1 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 Han Jue didn’t enter the illusion. Four words appeared in front of him.
 (Chaotic Change]
 Chaotic Change?
 What was the meaning of this?
 Han Jue pondered carefully. Could it be because of the recent changes in the Chaos?
 Why didn’t the Chaotic Consciousness target the Ultimate God of Punishment but throw its power into the Heavenly Dao?
 Could it be that this fellow wanted to arouse the Ultimate God’s fear?
 He could hope him in with Han Jue around. However, could he really be fearless if there was another Han Jue?
 There was another possibility. The Chaotic Consciousness hoped that the Chaos would be more chaotic. After all, there was still the Ninth Chaos above him.
 Han Jue thought for a while and stopped thinking about it.
 In any case, he couldn’t go against a Dao Creator for now. Thus, he would pretend not to know about this.
 Currently, he had already gathered nine Great Dao Fragments and could create another Great Dao Mystical Power.

 . Han Jue fell into deep thought.
 After a long while…
 He had an idea. He didn’t lack strange Mystical Powers now. It was better to create a powerful Mystical Power that was convenient to teach to disciples.
 He could create Mystical Powers, but he couldn’t create a Great Dao Mystical Power.
 He wanted to create an unparalleled Mystical Power that could be the signboard of the Hidden Sect. Others would know that they were a personal disciple of the Hidden Sect upon seeing this Mystical Power.
 Han Jue took out the nine Great Dao Fragments and fused them. A strong light burst out and illuminated the entire Daoist temple.
 In the mortal world.
 Dozens of servants knelt in front of a dazzling palace. In front of them was a middle-aged man in a python-patterned golden robe walking back and forth with an anxious expression. At this moment, the palace door opened and an old woman came out with a kasaya.
 The middle-aged man hurriedly went up and asked nervously, “Is it intact?”
 His gaze landed on the swaddled baby and he immediately beamed.
 This baby’s skin was fair and cute, unlike the skin of a newborn. Most importantly, the golden pattern between his eyebrows looked especially divine.
 The old woman smiled. “It’s fine. The Little Prince’s cries are so loud. He’s really extraordinary.”
 The middle-aged man had also heard it earlier. It was indeed deafening, causing him to panic. He thought that something had happened.
 He had children before this. When had their cries been so loud?
 The middle-aged man took his son with a smile.
 At this moment, a golden light shone down, startling the nearby servants. They crawled back.
 The middle-aged man was also shocked, but he still pretended to be calm.
 Everyone was shocked by his words.
 The middle-aged man trembled in excitement and asked carefully, “Immortal, are you serious?”
 Dao Lord Wu Du smiled. “I’m not talking nonsense.”
 Boom
 Heavenly lightning exploded, startling everyone so much that they looked up. They saw dark clouds suddenly gather and surge ferociously, making them panic.
 A green dragon was churning in the thundercloud. It was a spectacular sight.
 The green dragon stretched out a dragon head that was larger than a palace and said, “This child is fated with our Dragon Race. He can inherit our inheritance!”
 The middle-aged man was stunned.
 Dao Lord Wu Du frowned and thought that it was troublesome.
 However, this was not the end.
 A white crane came from the east. On the back of the crane stood a fairy. She wore an exquisite Daoist robe and her long hair fluttered.
 “This child is a destined disciple of our Jie School. Fellow Daoists, please don’t fight with
 us.”
 The Daoist-robed fairy’s voice resounded through the world, extremely cold.
 All the mortals in front of the palace were stunned. They had never seen such a scene.
 At the same time, in the Universal Hall
  The Sages saw this scene.
 Ji Xianshen smiled. “These guys run really fast.”
 The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate said, “I want to see whose disciple doesn’t have good judgment and can sit still.”
 The other Sages laughed as well. They were secretly informing their disciples to rope in the mortal child favored by the mysterious force.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du frowned and felt uneasy.
 The Foolish Sword Sage saw through his emotions and said, “I can’t see through it, but why worry since even the Divine Might Heavenly Sage isn’t moving?”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du felt that it made sense.
 How could Han Jue sit by and watch if there was really a threat?
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “This child’s background is extraordinary. He had to be taught well no matter who obtains him. Don’t let him take the evil path.”
 The Sages smiled and nodded.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du’s words meant that he had given up on the opportunity to fight for this child.
 Great Sage Void Soul couldn’t help but say, “In my opinion, we should suppress it and seal it as soon as possible to prevent future trouble.”


 In the third Dao Field.
 Han Jue finally opened his eyes after an unknown period of time.
 He had successfully created a new Great Dao Mystical Power.
 He named this Mystical Power the Divine Might Great Heaven Palm!
 This palm was ferocious. Any power, thing, and even rules could be destroyed. It only had the power to destroy. It was absolutely destroyed and could not be repaired.
 Han Jue began the simulation trial and challenged ten thousand Foolish Sword Sages. He only used the Divine Might Great Heaven Palm.
 He used his domineering Dharmic powers and killed ten thousand Foolish Sword Sages with a single palm. It was very easy.
 He continued to challenge more Foolish Sword Sages. He fought with twenty thousand Foolish Sword Sages before finally winning.
 Han Jue suddenly had a better idea.
 
 He used the Dharma Idol Fusion Technique to fuse with 2,449 Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols before using the Divine Might Great Heaven Palm.
 Twenty thousand Foolish Sword Sages were insta-killed!
 Han Jue’s confidence multiplied. He challenged his limits again. 25,000 Foolish Sword Sages!
 He killed all of them with a single palm strike after using the Dharma Idol Fusion Technique and the Divine Might Great Heaven Palm.
 Previously, he had always used the Dharma Idol Fusion Technique to wield the Primordial Judgment Sword. However, the Primordial Judgment Sword was only a Dharma treasure, after all. It was more powerful if he used a Dharma treasure to wield a Mystical Power.

 Han Jue decided to create another Great Dao Mystical Power regarding the Sword Dao next time.
 He didn’t do it this time because the Sword Dao couldn’t bypass Laozi.
 How could the Hidden Sect base itself on the Sword Dao?!
 Han Jue continued the simulation trial.
 In the end, he could no longer insta-kill the Foolish Sword Sages when the number reached thirty thousand. He could only win after a fierce battle.
 The Divine Might Great Heaven Palm was definitely the most domineering palm technique Mystical Power he had ever seen!
 This would be the Hidden Sect’s ultimate technique from now on!
 Han Jue immediately came to the second Dao Field and preached the Dao to all the Fiendcelestials, teaching them the Divine Might Great Heaven Palm.
 The Chaotic Fiendcelestials were all people with powerful bodies and were not good at using Dharma treasures. Most of them liked to rely on their physical talent. Thus, they were very suitable for the Divine Might Great Heaven Palm.
 A hundred years later.
 Han Jue came to the Hundred Peak Immortal River and asked Han Zuitian to choose ten geniuses of the Hidden Sect. Several days later, Han Zuitian brought ten Pseudo-Sage geniuses over. They represented the sect’s hope.
 Han Jue encouraged them. The ten geniuses were extremely excited. They kept kowtowing and paying respects to the ancestor.
 He also harvested a wave of six-star favorability, and there were no traitors with low stars or hatred.
 These geniuses’ talent was still a little lacking. They only learned it after Han Jue preached for a thousand years.
 Han Jue especially reminded them that this was a secret technique of the Hidden Sect and could not be taught to outsiders.
 The ten geniuses were even more excited, feeling that they had been acknowledged by their ancestor.
 Han Jue waved his hand for them to leave. He didn’t leave immediately. Instead, he looked at the Immortal World and the person who had obtained the Chaotic Consciousness’ power.
 Azure Heaven Mystic!
 as

 . This was not his original name. He changed his name after stepping into cultivation. He even severed all karma with the mortal world.
 Azure Heaven Mystic was proud and arrogant. He was famous in the Heavenly Race. He received high treatment in the two worlds with the Heavenly Race’s power.
 Han Jue smiled when he learned of this.
 It would indeed be a waste if this kid couldn’t attain the Dao in thirty thousand years with a Dao Creator’s inheritance.
 Han Jue began to observe Azure Heaven Mystic.
 Azure Heaven Mystic was extremely talented, but his personality was also extreme. At first, the Sages who did not obtain Azure Heaven Mystic were very disappointed, but they were gloating now.
 Han Jue saw that Azure Heaven Mystic was bullying his fellow disciples. This fellow challenged ten thousand Immortal Emperors alone. He even humiliated them after attaining victory. He was extremely arrogant.
 The humiliated Immortal Emperors didn’t dare to say anything. They couldn’t defeat him and could only endure.
 This was not the first time.
 “Hahahaha, you Immortal Emperors have cultivated for tens of thousands of years and finally entered the cycle of reincarnation. You don’t need to cultivate as mortals. Can you really repay the Heavenly Race for nurturing
 you?
 “I would definitely demote all of you to the mortal world to prevent you from embarrassing the Heavenly Race if I were the Heavenly Ancestor!”
 A blue-robed youth smiled proudly on a vast platform. Ten thousand Immortal Emperors lying within a radius of a million kilometers. All of them were red in the face and trembling.
 The blue-robed youth was Azure Heaven Mystic. He was handsome and had a tall figure. His waist was wrapped in a pearl ribbon and he wore cloud boots. He wore a Vermilion Bird Headband and looked like an immortal who had walked out of a painting.
 A group of Heavenly Race immortals flew over at this moment. One of the fairies reprimanded him. “Azure Heaven Mystic, don’t humiliate your fellow disciples!”
 Azure Heaven Mystic glanced at her and said disdainfully, “You little girl, what are you shouting for? Come down and fight me one-on-one if you have the guts. Watch as I, the Emperor Realm, trample on your Deity Realm and let you, a high and mighty fairy, cry for mercy under my feet!” The immortals around the fairy were indignant and cursed.
 Azure Heaven Mystic was not angry. Instead, he laughed even more wildly.
 Azure Heaven Mystic laughed wildly. He actually had the upper hand as he bickered with the other party alone.
 Han Jue shook his head and laughed.
 He couldn’t be bothered to do anything. After all, a Dao Creator was behind him.
 He didn’t hate Azure Heaven Mystic much. Although this person had a foul mouth and was arrogant, he did not kill his fellow disciples.
 It was worth mentioning that even though Azure Heaven Mystic was so famous, he did not have a single life in his hands. He hadn’t even killed worms or plants.
 He wouldn’t step on flowers if he saw them when this kid was young. He would fly if he
 could.
 In a sense, Azure Heaven Mystic was the cleanest person in the world.
  Han Jue stopped looking at him. He teleported to the third Dao Field and called Han Qing’er into the Daoist temple.
 “Father, what is it?” Han Qing’er raised her eyebrows and asked in high spirits.
 Han Jue said, “I recently created a Mystical Power. It will be the signature Mystical Power of the Hidden Sect in the future. Do you want to learn it?”
 Han Qing’er curled her lips. “How powerful can a temporarily created Mystical Power be? Teach me some ancient Mystical Power.”
 Thinking highly of ancient creations and belittling modern works. This was the same for all races.
 Han Jue smiled faintly. “Why don’t you try in the dream?”
 Han Qing’er hurriedly shook her head. “I’ll learn! I’ll learn!”
 Han Jue immediately preached the Dao and taught the Mystical Power.
 The lecture ended two hundred years later.
 Han Qing’er opened her eyes in shock.
 “There’s actually such a Mystical Power in the world. It’s as exquisite and profound as the Great Dao…”
 Han Qing’er looked at her father in admiration. Han Jue was secretly pleased.


 “This palm is too ferocious. Don’t use it unless it’s a life and death battle, especially against the disciples in the Dao Field.”
 Han Jue reminded, afraid that she would act recklessly.
 Han Qing’er nodded. “Don’t worry, Father. I know what to do. I’m not an arrogant and reckless person.”
 Han Jue smiled and nodded. For some reason, he thought of Azure Heaven Mystic.
 His arrogance was indeed the highest he had ever seen. He didn’t know if it was intentional.
 He was so arrogant, but there was no karma. It was very strange.
 Han Qing’er was very surprised and immediately went forward.
 The current simulation trial had already copied many experts of all realms, including Hidden Sect disciples.
  Several hours later.
 Han Qing’er opened her eyes and said excitedly, “Father, what Mystical Power is this? It’s so realistic! It’s even more realistic than a dream.”
 Han Jue said, “It contains either Hidden Sect disciples or enemies I’ve encountered before. It’s enough for you to use for countless years.”
 Han Qing’er nodded and left. She returned to her mother’s side and continued to immerse herself in the simulation trial.
 She looked like an Internet addict. Han Jue didn’t find it funny. After all, his personal disciples were the same back then. They were addicted for hundreds of years or even longer before returning to normal.
 Then, Han Jue closed his eyes and continued cultivating.
 Heavenly Dao, outside the 33rd Heaven.
 In the Heavenly Ancestor Palace.
 Ji Xianshen stared at the immortals in the hall with a dark expression. They were all Heavenly Race immortals.
 “I asked you to teach Azure Heaven Mystic well, but now, such a joke has happened. Who’s responsible for this?” Ji Xianshen asked coldly as he scanned everyone.
 The immortals looked at each other. No one replied.
 Ji Xianshen said coldly, “Bring me Azure Heaven Mystic. I want to teach him personally.”
 No Immortal God refused. They agreed.
 Ji Xianshen was annoyed. He immediately waved his sleeve and gestured for all the immortals to leave.
 Although the Heavenly Race was huge, they did not have any useful immortals.
 He couldn’t help but think of the Hidden Sect. Should he ask Li Xuan’ao to send him some geniuses?
 The Hidden Sect had the deepest foundation in the entire Immortal World. There were countless geniuses and their forces covered the Heavenly Dao.
 Ji Xianshen closed his eyes and cultivated after the immortals left.
 Several days later, an Immortal God brought Azure Heaven Mystic into the hall and bid farewell.
 Only Ji Xianshen and Azure Heaven Mystic were left in the hall.
 Ji Xianshen sized him up and was increasingly satisfied.
 It had to be said that this kid was indeed talented. Perhaps he could really catch up to his master.
 Azure Heaven Mystic said proudly, “Why did the Sage summon me? Could it be that you want to take me in as your disciple? I’ve already acknowledged a master and will never acknowledge a second master. Although the Sage is far stronger than my master, I can’t forget my roots!”
 Ji Xianshen smiled. “Why should I be your master? I’m your ancestor.”
 Azure Heaven Mystic was stunned. Although the Heavenly Race had Sages, they were not of the same lineage. He didn’t expect his master to be the disciple of a Sage.
 He immediately bowed and said, “Greetings, ancestor.”
 Ji Xianshen asked, “You clearly have great kindness in your heart. Why are you so arrogant and trampling on the dignity of others?”
 Azure Heaven Mystic looked up. “Ancestor, I can’t stand those people. They bully the weak and stick together. I like to target geniuses. I want to see who in the world has greater talent than me!”

 His face was still filled with arrogance.
 Ji Xianshen was helpless. They would have long died if anyone else dared to speak to a Sage like this.
 This kid was the only one who said that others were bullying people because of their strength and talent, but he did the same thing himself.
 “You’ll cultivate in my Dao Field for ten thousand years before returning to the Immortal World,” Ji Xianshen said seriously.
 He already had a plan.
 He wanted Azure Heaven Mystic to participate in the Chaotic Assembly!
 Azure Heaven Mystic hesitated for a moment and said, “Alright. Thank you, Ancestor.”
 Ji Xianshen waved his right hand and a mat landed in front of him. Azure Heaven Mystic understood and walked forward to sit down.
 Time passed quickly. Ten thousand years passed in the blink of an eye.
 In the past ten thousand years, other than cultivating Dao techniques, Ji Xianshen had also taught him many Mystical Powers.
 Azure Heaven Mystic flew out of the Heavenly Ancestor Palace. He had changed into a white robe and had a heroic figure. His temperament was extraordinary. One could feel the aura of a prodigy just by looking at his figure.
 He didn’t leave the 33rd Heaven immediately but wandered nearby.
 The 33rd Heaven was vast, with dozens of Dao Field.
 As he flew, he occasionally encountered Dao Seekers who looked at him in surprise.
 He was tempting fate!
 Azure Heaven Mystic didn’t know what they were thinking and did not disturb them.
 Azure Heaven Mystic bent down and rushed towards the Immortal World after walking through all the Sage Dao Field.
 A figure sped over and stopped him after passing through more than ten layers of sky.
 It was a beautiful woman in a purple-red immortal dress. Her hair was slightly messy, and spots of blood could be seen on her body. She looked terrified.
 “Fellow Daoist, please save me!” the woman said anxiously.
 Azure Heaven Mystic frowned.
 The woman said, “I’m a Heavenly Dao Immortal God. I offended the disciples of the Jie School. They’re chasing after me.” Azure Heaven Mystic said, “Oh.”
 “I’ll definitely thank you in the future as long as you can save me!”
 
 “Get lost!”
 The woman in the immortal dress was stunned.
 At this moment, more than ten disciples of the Jie School flew over on their swords.
 “Demon, where are you running to?” shouted angrily the middle-aged man in the lead holding a pagoda.
 Then, a green light shot out from the pagoda towards Azure Heaven Mystic and the woman.
 Azure Heaven Mystic’s eyes narrowed. He turned around, and a vertical eye opened between his brows. Golden light shot out from his eyes and destroyed the green light of the pagoda.
 “Who are you? How dare you stop the Jie School!” the middle-aged man asked angrily. The other disciples stopped and waited.
 The woman in the immortal dress said anxiously, “Fellow Daoist, they are after my Dharma treasure. You have to save…”
 Azure Heaven Mystic turned around and slapped her before she could finish speaking, causing her to vomit blood and fly out, piercing through the clouds.
 Azure Heaven Mystic said disdainfully, “Nonsense! Don’t wander the Immortal World if you don’t have the ability!”
 He turned to look at the group of the Jie School disciples and said, “I hate people who bully others the most. It’s your fate to meet me today. I’ll teach you a lesson. Come at me together!”
