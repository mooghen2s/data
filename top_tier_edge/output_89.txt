 “Is there really someone worse than me?” Shan’e was stunned and asked in disbelief. He fell silent after Han Jue recounted Han Bashen’s experience.
 “Cultivate well and find your true goal. Don’t disappoint me,” Han Jue said meaningfully. Shan’e couldn’t help but look up at him. For some reason, Shan’e felt that his smile was so holy and noble.
 Compared to this progenitor, he was really too petty.
 He was so petty that he wasn’t worthy of cultivating by his side.
 Shan’e had already understood the Han family. They had countless descendants and had been passed down for tens of millions of years. There were definitely descendants more outstanding than him in the myriad worlds and descendants who were even more miserable than him.
 Even so…
 The progenitor had chosen him, Shan’e!
 At this moment, indescribable emotions surged in his heart. His unwillingness and hatred dissipated.
 He said seriously, “Progenitor, I will work hard and not let you down!”
 Han Jue smiled. “Do you sense your own strength?”
 Han Jue said, “There’s an extremely mysterious mighty figure in the Chaos. He might also be the most mysterious existence in the entire Chaos and Shi Tian. His name is the Dark Forbidden Lord. No one has seen his true body, but many mighty figures were cursed to death by him…”
 He introduced the Dark Forbidden Lord from the perspective of others.
 Shan’e was surprised.
 Using curses to attain the Dao and shock the world?
 There was such an existence?
 Han Jue smiled, causing Shan’e’s blood to boil.
 The progenitor had given him a goal to cultivate, so he was naturally excited.
 After understanding why the progenitor had taken him in, not only was he not disappointed, but he was even more grateful
 to him.
 The progenitor actually chose him to fight such a powerful existence. How highly
 regarded was this!
 Shan’e clenched his fists and said, “I’ll definitely use the power of karma to protect the progenitor and everyone!”
 The so-called everyone included the descendants of the Han family and the Hidden Sect disciples. These days, Han Jue brought him to see the others, and they were very passionate and took care of him, making him feel the kinship he had not felt for a long time. He cherished this very much.
 Han Jue rubbed his head, making him feel embarrassed.
 Although Shan’e was almost five million years old, his mind was still stuck at the age of youth. He had been in seclusion all these years and had not gained any experience.
 “You’re my most favored descendant. I believe you.” Han Jue smiled gently. Shan’e was so excited that his entire body seemed to be burning.
 Then, Han Jue let him continue cultivating. After entering his cultivation state, Shan’e
 quickly calmed down.
 Han Jue smiled and started to check his emails.

 …
 It was still so lively.
 Every email contained abundant information. Han Jue could think of a soul-stirring plot.
 How interesting.
 He suddenly envied these guys.
 It was precisely because their cultivation speed was inferior to his that they could experience more life than him. Han Jue also wanted to act recklessly, but he had no backing.
 He had to keep a low profile and not attract too much attention before he grew up.
 Han Jue focused on the Ultimate Origin World after reading the emails.
 The Ultimate Origin World was far from the Chaos and Shi Tian. Only Great Dao Supremes could step into the blank domain. However, even Great Dao Supremes didn’t dare to enter the blank domain.
 The Dao Creators did not attack the Ultimate Origin World, so it was calm. However, this was only around the Ultimate Origin World. An unprecedented conflict had
 appeared in the Ultimate Origin World. As more and more living beings appeared, the Nether Race and the Chaotic Fiendcelestials preached. More and more cultivators appeared. Ambition would naturally grow as one became stronger.
 Some were born evil, some were born bloodthirsty, and some began to plunder
 because of the upper limit of their potential.
 There were all sorts of situations, and conflicts naturally appeared.
 Han Jue had no other thoughts about this. He was happy to see this. He could hand it over to the Nether Race and the Ultimate Origin Soul Race. Only after chaos could order be established.
 Battles would ensue sooner or later wherever living beings were. Powerful existences needed to be weak.
 He wouldn’t care as long as the Ultimate Origin World didn’t suffer any calamity. What he wanted to do was guide all living beings in the Ultimate Origin World.
 In an extremely bright hall.
 Two rows of stone pillars that were so tall that their tops couldn’t be seen formed a
 Great Dao that connected the heavens. At the end of the Great Dao, a figure sat on a
 thousand-foot-tall jade throne. It was Han Ling.
 Han Ling wore a golden sleeve dress and had a dignified posture. Her long hair scattered on the throne and she wore the Dragon Phoenix
 Emperor Crown. She was like an ancient god who had created everything. She meditated quietly, looking dignified and holy.
 At this moment, three figures suddenly appeared in the vast hall below. Han Yao, Han Ye, Han Bashen!
 The three of them had terrifying auras and were domineering, like invincible war gods. Facing Han Ling, they knelt down and bowed. Han Yao said, “Your Majesty, the Supreme Rules have been stripped from Shi Tian. The various factions have gone to fight for the
 Supreme Rules and want to obtain the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority. I want to represent the Creation Emperor Court in this
 fight!”
 Han Ye snorted. “This battle concerns the Creation Emperor Court’s reputation. We still have to send the strongest Emperor General,
 which is me!”
 Han Bashen chuckled. “Although you are
 strong, you are not as domineering as me. If you want to shock the world, you still have to
 rely on my strength!”
 Han Ling said, “All of you, go together. You must obtain the Supreme Rules. You can’t give up even if you face my second brother.” Han Ye smiled. “Ancestor Han Huang? I’ve long wanted to spar with him!” Han Yao and Han Bashen also looked expectant.
 They had never seen Han Huang’s true strength, but he was indeed famous. They
 could be said to be thunderous and naturally
 wanted to challenge him.


 Han Ling’s voice was indifferent, but it was extremely oppressive.
 Han Ye and the other two nodded and
 promised not to act recklessly.
 Han Ling instructed again before Han Ye and the other two left.
 Han Ling took out a mirror as she looked at their departing figures. This mirror was golden and murky.
 Han Ling’s lips moved as she silently chanted.
 Soon, a shadow crawled out of the mirror. It was her Emperor Soldier.
 The Emperor Soldier transformed into a beam
 of light and sped away.
 Han Ling smiled and closed her eyes.
 Shi Tian, in the extreme abyss.
 Dense mist filled the air. One could vaguely see the undulating mountains. A huge river of light floated in the air and flowed quietly, bringing light to a radius of billions of kilometers.
 Dao Sovereign, Zhao Xuanyuan, Jiang Yi, and Lao Dan flew over and stopped in front of the river.
 Lao Dan clicked his tongue in wonder. “Shi Tian is really magical. A Supreme Rule actually fell. This is something that I don’t dare to think about in the Chaos.”
 Jiang Yi shook his head. “I’m afraid it’s a conspiracy. Recently, the Chaos has been wreaking havoc in Shi Tian. The appearance of this Supreme Rule can attract most Chaotic cultivators. We can destroy everyone in one go if we set up an ambush.”
 Jiang Yi smiled as he felt that it made sense.
 Dao Sovereign stared at the Supreme Rule, thinking about something.
 Lao Dan was about to speak when a powerful aura arrived.
 “I, the Great Heavenly God King, want this Supreme Rule!”
 A powerful shout sounded. Great Heavenly God King, one of the Ten Absolute Prodigies of the first Chaotic Assembly.
 Dao Sovereign frowned. He naturally remembered the Great Heavenly God King. This fellow made him very unhappy. He didn’t expect to encounter him here today.
 Dressed in a clean white robe, the Great
 Heavenly God King stepped on a white dragon. The white dragon was ten thousand
 miles long. Its four claws stepped on the clouds and rode the mist. It was mighty and domineering.
 The Great Heavenly God King smiled as his gaze landed on Dao Sovereign. “Isn’t this the dark horse who suddenly deflated halfway through the Chaotic Assembly? Tsk tsk, are you coveting external forces again? Be careful not to empty your Dao heart and lose yourself!”
 These words were extremely vicious, causing Dao Sovereign’s eyes to erupt with killing
 intent.
 Without another word, Dao Sovereign attacked the Great Heavenly God King.
 Jiang Yi followed closely behind.
 Zhao Xuanyuan did not attack. Instead, he
 looked at the Supreme Rule and asked Lao Dan, “Old man, what power do you think this
 Supreme Rule represents?”
 Boom-
 The three Great Dao Supremes fought chaotically, shaking the world, causing the evil mist in the world to churn violently.
 Lao Dan stared at the Supreme Rule and said,
 “Its aura is vast, but it’s not ferocious at all. Perhaps it’s related to karma and
 providence.”
 At this moment, powerful auras arrived from
 all directions of this endless abyss.
 Zhao Xuanyuan and Lao Dan were moved.
 “Damn it, why is it so fast?”
 Zhao Xuanyuan cursed in a low voice. He took
 out a red sword made of dragon blood and
 prepared to fight.
 On the other side.
 Han Yu, Qin Ling, Azure Heaven Mystic, Ji
 Xianshen, and Zhao Shuangquan rode a green light and sped through the void.
 Zhao Shuangquan stared ahead and said, “The battle has already begun. There are at least
 ten Great Dao Supremes. The number of Great
 Dao Sages is constantly increasing. There are already more than thirty.”
 Han Yu sighed. “The fight for the Supreme Rules is really crazy.”
 Ji Xianshen smiled. “This scene reminds me
 of when I was still a mortal. Sage Fang Liang and I also wandered around. We dared to barge in no matter how many enemies there were.”
 All sorts of things from back then appeared in front of him.
 “Then, why is your relationship with Sage
 Fang Liang…” Qin Ling asked in surprise. Han Yu glared at him.
 Ji Xianshen smiled. “There will always be differences on the path of pursuit. Once some cracks appear, they can’t be healed. Even if
 the two sides want to reconcile, you juniors have to consider carefully, especially when it involves people close to you.”
 Qin Ling, Azure Heaven Mystic, and Zhao Shuangquan were thoughtful.
 if you can’t obtain it, understand?” Ji Xianshen waved his hand and smiled. His gaze landed on Azure Heaven Mystic and Zhao
 Shuang.
 Zhao Shuangquan said proudly, “I am the Eternal Peak. I’m naturally invincible.” Azure Heaven Mystic snorted. “You’re really arrogant. If not for the fact that I didn’t
 attend this Chaotic Assembly, how could you
 have obtained the Eternal Peak so easily?” Zhao Shuangquan chuckled.
 banquet of the Chaos. The various factions
 were fighting to split it amongst themselves.
UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m …
 Five million years later.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and checked his
 emails. During this seclusion, he felt many times that
 a huge battle had erupted. It was not only Shi
 Tian, but also the Chaos. It even involved the Ultimate God of Punishment. However, the Ultimate God of Punishment and the disciples
 did not use the Invocation Technique to summon him, so he did not care. [Your disciple Dao Sovereign was attacked by your good friend Zhao Shuangquan.] [Your disciple Dao Sovereign was attacked by your good friend Azure Heaven Mystic.] [Your disciple Jiang Yi was attacked by your descendant Han Yu.]
 [Your disciple Dao Sovereign was attacked by your son Han Tuo and was severely injured.] [Your son Han Tuo was attacked by your descendant Han Ye.]
 [Your son Han Tuo was attacked by your descendant Han Yao and was severely injured.]
 [Your descendant Han Yao was attacked by
 your enemy, the Nine-Headed Divine Spirit. He was severely injured.] [Your enemy was attacked by your good friend Huang Zuntian and was severely injured.]
 Good lord, had these guys gone mad?
 Han Jue couldn’t help but deduce that chaotic battle. So it was to fight for a Supreme Rule of Shi Tian. This Supreme Rule was controlled by
 a force that Han Jue couldn’t even deduce.
 The Immeasurable Destruction Venerable! How despicable!
 No one from the Chaos obtained the Supreme
 Rule even after tens of thousands of years of
 chaotic battle. Instead, they were all injured. The Supreme Rule shattered into three thousand fragments and scattered in every corner of Shi Tian under the Immeasurable Destruction Venerable’s deliberate control. In the next two million years, it became a divine
 with Shi Tian, the overall domain was actually expanding. New creations and strange lands
 were also born in the Chaos, and the Chaotic Spirit Qi was also steadily increasing. The Chaos would increase by another level
 and not watched as their Great Dao World was
 devoured.
 Although the Immeasurable Destruction Venerable was plotting against the Chaos, his
 methods were too small and could not be shown. He couldn’t stop the situation of the
 anyone? Tell me, who do you want me to curse?” Shan’e’s voice floated over from the side. His tone was filled with excitement and anticipation.


 “Oh? Will your curse be deduced?”
 Han Jue raised his eyebrows. His tone was calm, like a basin of cold water extinguishing Shan’e’s excitement.
 Shan’e hesitated for a moment and said, “Those weaker than me shouldn’t be able to deduce me. I can’t guarantee that with those with higher cultivation levels than me…”
 Han Jue said meaningfully, “No one can deduce the Dark Forbidden Lord. Your target is him.”
 “Perhaps his cultivation level is top-notch, so no one can deduce it?”
 “Then you have to have a top-notch
 cultivation level. Before that, you can’t curse anyone to prevent trouble!”
 “But…”
 Shan’e’s face immediately turned pale. How long would it take for him to reach the top standard Han Jue mentioned?
 Han Jue smiled. “I should test your strength. Are you prepared?”
 Shan’e asked in surprise, “What do you want to do?”
 Han Jue introduced the simulation trial to him and gave him the authority to use it.
 As expected, Shan’e quickly became obsessed with the simulation trial.
 Shan’e was still a little short of the Great Dao Realm. His cultivation talent was clearly not as high as the other creation stars. Perhaps this was their strength.
 Shan’e’s Curse Origin Star was not an existence that could fight head-on.
 Shan’e couldn’t dominate the Freedom Realm in the simulation trial, but he felt that he was invincible in the same realm. Little did he know that Han Ling could fight ten thousand people of the same realm.
 Han Jue didn’t have high requirements for Shan’e, so he didn’t use Han Ling to suppress him.
 Looking at the simulation trial, Han Jue stood up and left.
 After interacting with his Dao Companions for a period of time, Han Jue came to the Hundred Peak Immortal River and visited Fairy Xi Xuan.
 Coincidentally, Chang Yue’er was also here.
 “Junior Han!”
 Seeing Han Jue appear, Chang Yue’er
 immediately smiled in surprise.
 She immediately rushed over and hugged him.
UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m “You really care about Master. I’ve never seen you visit me before!”
 Chang Yue’er giggled. She was not jealous at all because she knew that she had no right to be.
 If not for Han Jue, she would have long turned to dust. How could she have achieved her
 current Freedom cultivation?
 Fairy Xi Xuan berated her. “Yue’er, don’t talk nonsense.”
 Chang Yue’er smiled even more proudly. She
 hugged his arm and refused to let go.
 Han Jue had to remind her tactfully and
 naturally pulled his arm out.
 The three of them sat down and started
 chatting.
 Han Jue asked them about their experiences
 during this period of time. Chang Yue’er
 began to chatter non-stop.
 Han Jue and Fairy Xi Xuan smiled at her and
 found it interesting.
 Although the cultivation days were boring and
 boring, the occasional atmosphere was quite
 satisfying.
 Even though Han Jue had an invincible goal,
 he enjoyed his current situation.
 His days would probably be as calm as now when he was invincible. However, he did not pursue invincibility to have an exciting life. It was just to ensure his safety.
 Chang Yue’er spoke for two hours without finishing.
 Han Jue smiled. “Are you very curious about
 Shi Tian?”
 “Yes, but I heard that Shi Tian’s battle was
 extremely tragic. I shouldn’t join in the fun.
 I’m afraid that I’ll lose my life if I’m not careful.”
 “You can leave your soul fragment behind. You can revive even if you die. You’re Freedom, after all.”
 “What if I encounter the legendary Great Dao
 Supreme? It will be bad if they use the Dao of Karma to destroy my soul fragment to kill my
 main body.”
 “It’s fine. You can summon me if you
 encounter danger. I’ll support you.”
 “Really?” Chang Yue’er asked in surprise. Han Jue smiled and nodded.
 Fairy Xi Xuan frowned. “Yue’er, don’t be like
 this. Han Jue is busy cultivating. How can he divert his attention to you?”
 Chang Yue’er curled her lips and felt that it
 made sense.
 Han Jue smiled. “With my cultivation, not to
 mention helping you, even splitting ten
 thousand wills is as easy as flipping my
 palm.”
 Chang Yue’er thought for a moment and said, “Forget it.”
 back to cultivate.”
 Chang Yue’er’s eyes lit up. “Really?”
 “Yes.’
 “That’s great. Master, do you want to go
 together? This is a good opportunity to nurture… experience!”
 Chang Yue’er giggled. Han Jue saw through
 her schemes and knew that she pretended to almost let it slip.
 However, Han Jue didn’t expose her. Chang
 Yue’er’s intentions were mainly to please
 him. Chang Yue’er might really like him. More
 than 80 million years had passed and she had
 never had an affair with other men. Han Jue could deduce this.
 This opportunity was also a chance for them
 to grow closer to each other. Previously, Xing Hongxuan had also reminded him that Fairy Xi Xuan and Chang Yue’er were still waiting
 for him. Why didn’t she give him a chance? Not to mention a transcendent cultivation expert like Han Jue, there were countless ordinary Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal women. Of course, some men liked multiple
 women. However, Han Jue already had enough women and was clearly not looking for more. Fairy Xi Xuan hesitated at Chang Yue’er’s suggestion.
 Han Jue looked at her and smiled. “Let’s go
 together. I want you to go. We’ve known each
 other for so long, but we’ve never traveled together.”
 Fairy Xi Xuan smiled. “Alright.”
 Just like that, the two women packed up and followed Han Jue to Shi Tian.
 As a Dao Creator, Han Jue would not be
 rejected no matter where he went. This was a realm that surpassed the Great Dao World. However, once he entered Shi Tian, he would definitely be noticed by the Immeasurable Destruction Venerable.
 He believed that the Immeasurable Destruction Venerable could guess his reason after seeing the two women.
 With their cultivation levels, there was really
 no need to destroy each other’s Great Dao
 World and form a death grudge. If the Great Dao World perished, the Dao Creator would not die. As long as the Great Dao World was
 destroyed not too late, the Dao Creator could directly recover.
 Just like how the Ninth Chaos directly revived
 all living beings in the Chaos.
 It was so domineering! They quickly entered Shi Tian under Han Jue’s
 lead.
 Chang Yue’er looked around. “It doesn’t look much different from the Chaos. I heard that
 Junior Han’s children are also fighting for a huge opportunity in Shi Tian. I wonder if I can encounter them on this trip.”
 Han Jue smiled. “They’re indeed still around, but there’s no need to encounter them. They’re busy fighting for opportunities and don’t have the time like us.”
 Fairy Xi Xuan asked, “Could it be that one of your descendants created the recently famous Creation Emperor Court in the Chaos?” “Yes, Ling’er created it.”
 “Ah? That girl is so powerful?” Chang Yue’er was surprised. She had always felt that Han Ling was weak and adorable, unlike Han Qing’er, who was as lively as her.
 Fairy Xi Xuan smiled. “I sensed it before. She’s very similar to… the past you.” Thinking of the past, she tried her best to fight for opportunities for Han Jue, but whenever she wanted to go out or there was
 some risk, Han Jue would not accept it no matter what. He would appear humble to everyone and even look weak in their eyes.


 Although Shi Tian was in chaos, that was only for the environment. Many places were still peaceful and not harmed.
 Han Jue and the other two came to a great world at the edge of Shi Tian. It was like the Earth in the Milky Way. It lay quietly in the corner of the void, lonely and beautiful.
 The three of them entered the world. Countless mortal worlds gathered around this world like the Heavenly Dao. They were still dominated by humans. To be precise, they were a race with Connate Dao Physique. They had different names in different worlds.
 They first entered a mortal world and began to travel.
 Han Jue chatted and laughed with them as he looked into the depths of Shi Tian.
 Another huge battle erupted!
 He saw some familiar figures. Han Tuo, Yi Tian, Han Huang, Han Ye, Han Yao, Dao Sovereign, Zhao Xuanyuan, Han Bashen, Zhao Shuangquan, Huang Zuntian, Ji Xianshen, and so on.
 They were all fighting for a Supreme Rule. How lively.
 As they fought, everyone began to besiege Han Huang because he was too powerful.
 Even Han Tuo had to admit that his second brother had already far surpassed him.
 The three of them arrived at a town and felt the culture there.
 It was impossible for the three of them to encounter trouble with their cultivation
 levels. Even if someone dared to find trouble with them, they could resolve it with a
 thought.
 After the three of them walked for more than a thousand worlds, the chaotic battle in the depths of Shi Tian continued.
 Since they had nothing to do, Han Jue and the
 other two stopped on a cliff. Han Jue waved his hand and created a screen of light, revealing the scene of a chaotic battle.
 The two women watched curiously.
 Chang Yue’er saw Han Yao displaying his Mystical Power and couldn’t help but sigh. “Time passed so quickly. Junior Han’s descendants are already so strong.”
 Fairy Xi Xuan smiled. “That’s right. Although
 there’s a huge difference in seniority between us and them, in terms of experience, we’re far inferior to them.”
 She looked at Han Jue with a gentle gaze. The greatest providence in her life was when she accepted Han Jue as her disciple.
 Chang Yue’er asked curiously, “Junior Han, who do you think will laugh in the end?
 Huang’er, Tuo’er, or your other descendants? That Han Yao, Han Ye, and Han Bashen are
 very powerful when they join forces.”
 “If there’s no surprise, it’s Huang’er, but wanting to obtain that rule is wishful
 thinking.”
 “Why? He can’t obtain it even if he wins?”
 “Yes, there’s a conspiracy behind this. It involves the existence who created this Great World. His cultivation level is extraordinary. He can’t be named or discussed, so I won’t introduce him to you,” Han Jue replied. Chang Yue’er and Fairy Xi Xuan looked at each other.
 They couldn’t imagine it. Could there really be
 a Creation God?
 Shi Tian?”
 has cultivated countless years earlier than me. If we really fight to the death, I’m naturally
 not his match.”
 Chang Yue’er frowned.
 She thought that Han Jue was already the
 strongest, but she didn’t expect there to be stronger existences.
 “The Divine Might Heavenly Sage is really
 humble. Your ability has already surpassed mine.”
 A voice entered Han Jue’s ears.
 It was the Immeasurable Destruction Venerable.
 Han Jue replied in his mind, “Fellow Daoist,
 don’t worry. I’m only here to play. I won’t harm Shi Tian.”
 The Immeasurable Destruction Venerable’s voice sounded, “I hope so. I’m also worried that the juniors will be rash and rude.” Han Jue replied in his mind, “You’re thinking
 too much. I’m also afraid that you’ll destroy my Great Dao World.”
 The Immeasurable Destruction Venerable
 snorted and did not say anything else.
 From the beginning to the end, Chang Yue’er
 and Fairy Xi Xuan did not hear their conversation. They were still nervously watching the battle.
 Even if their cultivation levels were insufficient and they could not see the details of the battle, from the scene, they could barely tell who had the upper hand. Han Huang fought more than a hundred Great
 Dao Sages alone. He was extremely domineering. His strength was clearly on par with his other opponents.
 The three of them continued on their way after watching for several hours. There were many wonders in Shi Tian’s
 world. Several days later, they met in the void.
 In the dark void stood a lake that emitted seven-colored light. That’s right, it was a lake. It was tens of billions of kilometers long and wide. The land and a forest formed a circle that surrounded the lake. Han Jue could feel that it contained extremely
 dense Spirit Qi. Not only that, but there were
 also the Great Dao of Time and Space hidden inside.
 In other words, this lake could connect the
 past and the future, traveling through the past and present.
 “So beautiful!” Chang Yue’er exclaimed in
 surprise. It was all thanks to her that this trip was not so boring.
 Han Jue felt like he was raising his daughter with Fairy Xi Xuan. Fairy Xi Xuan frowned. “There are many powerful auras inside. Let’s take a detour.”
 Chang Yue’er waved her hand and said, “Master, what are you thinking? With Junior Han around, what are you afraid of? Could it
 be that Shi Tian’s master is lying inside?”
 Fairy Xi Xuan was still very hesitant. She looked at Han Jue. He smiled and said, “There’s indeed a Great
 To those at the Freedom Realm, there was no difference between a Great Dao Sage and a Great Dao Supreme. That was why she was so
 The three of them quickly entered the Seven-Colored Mountain Lake. The existences
 hidden in the lake and forest did not sense
 them. Chang Yue’er and Fairy Xi Xuan guessed that
 it was Han Jue’s doing.
 How terrifying. He had numbed the other
 party without anyone knowing.
 The two women toured curiously, while Han
 Jue’s thoughts drifted.
 Han Huang began to borrow his Ultimate
 Origin Power again.
 He had to control it cautiously, afraid that
 Han Huang would explode. Even a wisp of Ultimate Origin Power was
 enough for Han Huang to deal with the danger in front of him. Then again, what was that?
 A mysterious and strange existence appeared
 in Han Huang’s hand.
 Han Jue found it familiar.
 …
 Wasn’t that the Strange Deity? The Strange Deity was released by Han Jue a
 long time ago. At first, this fellow would return and then disappear. Han Jue deduced that it was not in danger and didn’t care. The Strange Deity was very similar to the Inauspicious Evil. All living beings couldn’t spy on it, but it could attack living beings. The current Strange Deity had already condensed a physical body. Han Jue had only forgotten to pay attention to it several times.
 in seclusion recently. He didn’t expect it to grow to this extent.
 Great Dao Supreme! There was something wrong with its body.
 Although Han Huang’s attack could kill it, it quickly recovered. Undying and indestructible, its recovery speed
 was extremely fast!


 In the chaotic void.
 A dense mist formed by Dharmic powers filled the air. Looking up, there were spatial cracks everywhere, revealing alternate spaces of different depths. Some cracks even revealed the paleness of a blank domain.
 Han Huang held two Ultimate Origin Soul Oblivion in his hand. He wore a blood-red robe and exquisite silver armor. A red belt was wrapped around his waist like a tendon. His long hair fluttered and his gaze was cold as he stared at the figure attacking from afar.
 The Great Dao Sages in all directions also stopped.
 “What is that?” Zhao Xuanyuan frowned and asked. No one answered him. Even the
 experienced Lao Dan frowned and stared at the white smoke black shadow.
 The white-qi black shadow was the Strange Deity!
 The Strange Deity ate the Inauspicious Evil as food. It was not a living being, but it had a terrifying ability that surpassed all potential.
 Han Ye said in a low voice, “Be careful. This thing is a little strange and lifeless. It’s definitely not a living being.”
 Han Bashen scratched his head and said, “Could it be a product of the Supreme Rules?”
 “I’m not sure, but with Ancestor Han Huang around, we can let both of them be injured. Only then will we have a chance,” Han Yao said softly. He looked at Han Huang’s insufferably arrogant figure, his eyes filled with unwillingness.
 Han Yao wasn’t the only one. The Hidden Sect was also deeply stimulated.
 anger and red eyes.
 Han Huang looked down at the Strange Deity
 and asked, “What are you?”
 The Strange Deity laughed sinisterly. “I’m
 very close to you, but you’ve never seen me before.”
 Very close?
 Han Huang frowned, not understanding what these words meant. He had lived for 80 million years and had encountered too many living beings. How could he remember them clearly?
 However, this fellow’s aura was too strange. It actually made him feel a long-awaited horror.
 The Strange Deity chuckled. “I also want this Supreme Rule. Can you give it to me?” Han Huang snorted. “That depends on your ability!”
 With that, the Strange Deity suddenly appeared in front of him. The white Qi around him transformed into a huge net that covered the sky and drowned Han Huang.
 Everything happened too fast, so fast that the other Great Dao Sages could not react.
 However, no one was worried about Han Huang.
 Boom-
 The strange white Qi was minced by a powerful force. Han Huang held the Ultimate Origin Soul Oblivion in his right hand and pierced through the Strange Deity. The Strange Deity suddenly opened a pair of blood-red eyes. The space on both sides of Han Huang squeezed and pulled him into a
 deep alternate space.
 After all, Han Huang had been through hundreds of battles. He did not panic at all.
 He controlled the Ultimate Origin Soul Oblivion and tore apart layers of alternate
 space. He quickly found the Strange Deity hiding in the dark and killed him.
 Immediately after, the Strange Deity appeared behind him. Countless Resentful Ghosts
 roared and attacked him.
 Unconsciously, Han Huang felt powerful karma restricting his body, making it difficult for him to move.
 He immediately mobilized his mysterious and powerful unknown power to disperse the
 power of karma. The illusions attacked again,
 causing him to sink into the cycle of reincarnation.
 While Han Huang was in the illusion, the
 Strange Deity immediately attacked. However, Han Huang instinctively waved the Ultimate Origin Soul Oblivion and killed him again.
 The Strange Deity condensed his body again and muttered to himself, “This kid is too abnormal… As expected of your son…”
 His words were heard by Han Jue, who was far away in the Seven-Colored Mountain Lake. Han Huang’s performance was indeed not
 bad. Even if he was pulled into the endless illusions, he could still rely on his instincts to kill the enemy.
 Soon, Han Huang escaped the Strange Deity’s Mystical Power and fought with it.
 The two of them were temporarily on par,
 neither could do anything to the other.
 On the other side.
 The other Great Dao Sages and Great Dao and Supremes targeted the Supreme Rules again and fought again.
 Without Han Huang, their chances of success were greater.
 Han Jue retracted his gaze. Although the
 Strange Deity was strong, it was not Han Huang’s match. With the Ultimate Origin Power, no one below the Dao Creator Realm could defeat Han Huang. The ability of the Strange Deity was probably
 going to consume something, but others could not see it.
 Han Jue retracted his gaze and started to
 many natural treasures, especially at the
 bottom. It was a fantasy forest formed by natural treasures. Many living beings were living there, like people in the water. Most of
 them had transformed. Their duty was to protect the natural treasures, and the powerful existences outside the lake protected them. In the end, the natural treasures had to
 fall into the mouths of powerful existences to help them cultivate.
 It was good to help each other.
 After staying for a few hours, the two women each picked a golden lotus. This lotus contained great providence. Obtaining this treasure could increase their providence.
 Providence was mysterious and profound.
 Like karma, it was unfathomable. To mortals, it was luck.
 He didn’t know why they wanted it. Han Jue
 couldn’t be bothered to calculate or guess. After the three of them left, Han Jue removed
 the illusion he used on the living beings in the Seven-Colored Mountain Lake.
 In the next few thousand years, the three of them traveled around and saw the most magical wonders and creations of Shi Tian.
 The battle for the Supreme Rule continued. The three of them returned to the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 Their relationship had warmed up during this period of time. The two women also understood what Han Jue meant and were in a good mood.
 The two of them were alone for decades. Han
 Jue found Fairy Xi Xuan, but nothing happened between them. They only discussed the Dao.
 “When I attain the Great Dao, I’ll…” Fairy Xi Xuan said softly.
 Han Jue smiled. “It’s fine. It’s up to you. Our cultivation levels have long surpassed that of a mortal. Companionship is better than any action.”
 Fairy Xi Xuan smiled. “Soon. I will definitely
 Han Jue smiled and nodded. The two of them chatted for a while more
 before Han Jue left.
 He immediately entered cultivation after returning to the third Dao Field.
 As for Shan’e, he was still obsessed with the
 simulation trial.
 Tsk tsk, this kid’s opponent was at the Sage Realm. He challenged all the Primordial Chaos Sages in the simulation trial in one go and bullied them in different ways. He couldn’t hide his smile.
 This kid probably didn’t know that he could spy on the battle in the simulation trial. Han Jue didn’t interrupt him and let him be happy.
 Tens of thousands of years later, Shi Tian’s chaotic battle ended.
 Han Huang obtained the Supreme Rule and
 his name shook Shi Tian. This time, he defeated all living beings. Those self-proclaimed top geniuses also admitted defeat and no longer pestered him. Han Huang held the two Supreme Rules, one
 of the Chaos and one of Shi Tian. His aura
 reached its peak. The entire Chaos and Shi Tian could sense it. He was extremely ostentatious, afraid that all living beings would not know.
