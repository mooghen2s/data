 His ascension had actually stopped!
 He had already fantasized about meeting Tang Wan, but he did not expect his grandfather to forcefully pull him back.
 He felt that it was ridiculous.
 After all, his grandfather was also an immortal and could definitely go to the Immortal World. Why did he pull him back? This was the first time Chu Xiaoqi was dissatisfied with Han Jue. He didn’t understand what his grandfather wanted, so he was angry and didn’t look for him.
 Chu Xiaoqi finally came to him several days later.
 He sat in front of Han Jue and snorted. He crossed his arms and looked unhappy.
 Han Jue ignored him. He couldn’t help but say, “Grandpa!”
 Seeing that Han Jue still didn’t open his eyes, Chu Xiaoqi almost died of anger.
 Extremely angry, Chu Xiaoqi suddenly lay on the ground and wailed.
 Han Tuo would definitely die of anger if he saw this.
 Han Jue asked, “Do you really want to see her?”
 Chu Xiaoqi looked up. “If I don’t go, she might be taken by other men. Even if I’m confident in saving her, I can’t let myself be cuckolded!”
 Han Jue couldn’t help but laugh. “Don’t worry, she won’t find anyone else.”
 “Why?”
 “Aren’t you confident? Why can’t you trust her?”
 “But…”
 “Xiaoqi, there’s no medicine for regret in this world. As long as you lose it, you have to be prepared to bear the consequences. Cultivate well. You’ll be at the bottom if you go to the Immortal World now. How can you attract her, who has already changed her mind?” “I…”
 “Since you can’t attract her, why not trust her? I believe that she hasn’t changed her mind. What you have to do is make yourself stronger, so strong that you can change everything.”
 Chu Xiaoqi fell into deep thought.
 Han Jue smiled. “I’ve never taken risks for
 women in my life. The path of cultivation should focus on oneself. Only if you’re strong enough can you have the right to protect everything.”
 Chu Xiaoqi took a deep breath. “I understand.
 Grandpa, I’m sorry. I was short-sighted. Then, when do you think I can ascend?”
 “Let’s wait a little longer. Perhaps soon, or a long time.”
 Han Jue closed his eyes. Chu Xiaoqi thought for a while before standing up and leaving, preparing to cultivate.
 Chu Xiaoqi became even more diligent. He meditated and cultivated every day to increase his cultivation.
 Chu Xiaoqi’s life seemed long, but in the Endless Era, time still passed very slowly.
 In the blank domain.
 The Heavenly Court stood above dozens of worlds. It emitted endless divine light that illuminated all worlds.
 Heavenly Court, Imperial Garden.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor and Han Tuo were
 drinking and chatting.
 Han Tuo smiled.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor smiled. “Yes, you too. In the past, you rarely visited me.”
 Han Tuo shook his head. “At that time, my
 obsession was too deep and I indeed neglected too much. Now that I’ve removed my burden, I suddenly feel that being the strongest is not that important.”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor smiled teasingly.
 “That’s true. After all, you can’t catch up to your father.”
 Han Tuo rolled his eyes. Who chatted like
 this?
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor said, “By the way,
 you came at the right time. Do you know Chen
 Jue?”
 “Yes, he’s a descendant of the Han family. He’s the most talented recently.”
 “I want to recruit him. Are you going to speak
 up for me?”
 “This child didn’t seek refuge with a major faction. He only has Ling’er secretly protecting him. Why didn’t you directly invite
 him?”
 “I’ve invited him. This kid disdains
 immortals…”
 Speaking of this, the Evil Heavenly Emperor
 was very helpless. That Chen Jue really looked like that existence. Of course, it was only his appearance and personality.
 Han Tuo shrugged. “Then forget it. As an
 ancestor, I can’t force the fate of my descendants.”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor sighed and immediately felt desolate.
 Han Tuo ignored his performance.
 The two of them changed the topic and continued chatting.
 “Why have you descended into the mortal
 world before?” the Evil Heavenly Emperor suddenly asked.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor was also a Great Dao Supreme. He couldn’t sense Han Jue’s existence, but he could capture Han Tuo’s movements. However, he couldn’t deduce what he had done.
 This kid wouldn’t descend into the mortal world for no reason.
 Han Tuo smiled and said, “You can’t ask
 about this. It’s a very important matter. Your Majesty, this Endless Era looks peaceful, but there are actually undercurrents. The Heavenly Court is a neutral force. Don’t
 accidentally take the wrong side.” The Heavenly Court’s foundation was still a little weak. In Han Tuo’s opinion, it could not withstand the test.
 Of course, Han Tuo was only scaring the Evil
 Heavenly Emperor.
 Han Jue’s nurturing of Chu Xiaoqi was clearly different. Han Tuo didn’t want to disturb them because of him.
 Han Tuo couldn’t see through his father, but
 he felt that there was a deeper meaning in nurturing Chu Xiaoqi.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor was deep in thought.
 Several hours later, Han Tuo left. The Evil Heavenly Emperor’s smile vanished.
 He looked at the mortal world Han Tuo had gone to.
 Dao Mystic Realm…
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor’s expression was
 The Heavenly Court alone could not do it.
 Time passed quickly. A thousand years had passed in the mortal world. The dynasties had changed, but the cultivators in the mountains
 did not know the changes outside. Chu Xiaoqi was one of them. After a thousand years of cultivation, his
 cultivation level had already reached the
 Grand Unity Heaven Immortal Realm. This speed was very slow in Han Jue’s eyes, but it was considered fast to a normal Immortal World. On this day, Han Jue summoned him.
 A more stable Chu Xiaoqi sat in front of Han
 Jue openly. He didn’t play the same tricks as before.
 “What is it, Grandpa?”
 Chu Xiaoqi smiled. Looking at his mature and
 handsome face, Han Jue felt a sense of achievement.
 After all, he had raised this kid personally.
 Han Jue smiled and said, “You can ascend
 now.”
 me?”
 “No, go ahead. You should walk your own path from now on.”
 Han Jue shook his head gently. Chu Xiaoqi
 became silent.
 Chu Xiaoqi suddenly said, “I’m not leaving. I’ll stay by your side.” “Why? Don’t you miss your Wan’er?” “Everyone has their own life. If she still cares
 about me, she will find me sooner or later. I don’t owe her anything, but I owe you everything,” Chu Xiaoqi said seriously. He looked at Han Jue with gratitude.
 He knew very well that if not for this grandfather, he would have died under the
 cliff. He would not have met Tang Wan later and embarked on the path of cultivation. After interacting with him for so many years, he had never been filial to Han Jue. Chu Xiaoqi thought of how Han Jue would stay in this valley alone and enjoy the loneliness of time if he ascended to find that
 From the time they met until now, everything
 in the past appeared in front of him.
 From the beginning to the end, the person him was his grandfather.


 Han Jue was satisfied when he saw Chu Xiaoqi’s expression. He had not nurtured him in vain. What a good grandson.
 He smiled and said, “Go. I really want you to go this time. What you said just now. Everyone has their own life. You have yours too. I’m only a passerby in your life.”
 Chu Xiaoqi was silent, his heart filled with reluctance.
 Chu Xiaoqi couldn’t help but ask, “Is this your current state of mind?”
 “That’s right.”
 “How old are you? Grandpa, are you a very powerful immortal in the Immortal World?”
 “I don’t belong to the Immortal World. Actually, I’m not an immortal. As for how old I am, I’m actually not that old.”
 Han Jue smiled gently. These words made Chu Xiaoqi think that he was a land deity traveling the mortal world.
 The grandfather and grandson chatted for a long time. Finally, under Han Jue’s wave of the hand, Chu Xiaoqi was expelled by the rules of the mortal world and began to ascend.
 For some reason, Chu Xiaoqi suddenly felt sorrow and confusion.
 His family had long turned to dust. Now that he had bid farewell to his grandfather, he was really wandering the world alone.
 What should he do in the future? Where should he go?
 Chu Xiaoqi no longer acted like a child. He looked up at the sky with anticipation.
 Immortal World, I want to see how exciting you are!
 After he ascended, Han Jue also quietly left the villa. The villa returned to its ghostly appearance.
 After more than a thousand years of
 accumulation, the ghost aura of the villa was even stronger. It was definitely a dangerous place to the mortal world.
 …
 Han Jue returned to the third Dao Field.
 Many disciples were still cultivating near the
 Han Jue quietly returned to his Daoist temple. Shan’e had never returned since he went out. It seemed that he had been holding it in in the
 past.
 Sigh, these disciples were like his children.
 They rarely returned after going out.
 Han Jue sat for a while before calling Fang Liang in.
 Fang Liang had been waiting for him outside for hundreds of years.
 Fang Liang entered the temple and bowed. After sitting down, he said, “Grandmaster, I feel that time and space might have
 changed.”
 Han Jue asked, “Why?”
 “I often study space-time and know its
 changes. Recently, I’ve clearly felt that I’ve
 forgotten something. There are also fluctuations in the space-time rules. Someone
 must have tampered with space-time. I’m worried that it will affect us,” Fang Liang said
 worriedly, but his words made Han Jue think highly of him.
 Thinking about it carefully, Fang Liang had traveled through space and time earlier than
 Ji Xianshen.
 However, the fact that Fang Liang could sense
 the Origin Space-time proved that his talent
 was very impressive.
 Even a Great Dao Supreme couldn’t sense the Origin Space-time. Only a Dao Creator could
 do it. Speaking of which, Fang Liang and Ji Xianshen were once the best brothers. Later,
 because of the battle of the Heavenly Dao’s Immeasurable Calamity, the two of them became strangers for hundreds of millions of
 years.
 He did not expect that after Ji Xianshen disappeared, the only person who cared about him was this brother who had turned against
 him.
 Han Jue said, “That’s right. This is indeed the case. A disciple touched the Origin Space-time and was devoured by karma. Everyone forgot about him.”
 Fang Liang frowned.
 Han Jue didn’t disturb his thoughts. After a long time, Fang Liang asked, “Is that
 person important to me?”
 “Is this question meaningful?” “I’m uneasy. If he’s important to me, I’ll
 definitely save him. By severing karma like this, he should have no choice. Ancestor, please guide me.”
 Han Jue looked at him meaningfully and said,
 “We can only investigate if we go to the Origin Space-time, but I don’t know how to save him. You were once the best brothers, but later, you broke up. You didn’t get back together until he disappeared.’
 He told the truth. Fang Liang would decide on his own.
 Fang Liang frowned even more. The Daoist temple fell silent. Han Jue’s gaze passed through the Dao Field
 and landed on the blank domain.
 After the Chaos shattered, the worlds of the Chaos had already dispersed. It could even be said that most of the worlds of the Endless
 Era had evolved from the Chaotic World. Han Jue discovered that his children were estranged. They hadn’t interacted for a long time. Speaking of which, the most filial was the
 youngest son he did not think highly of, Han Yunjin.
 Han Yunjin’s potential was the worst, but he
 would return every once in a while to visit his
 elders. It was the same for his brothers and sisters. However, other than Han Ling, Han Tuo, Han Huang, and Han Qing’er did not care much about him.
 Fang Liang looked up and said, “I choose to save him. Grandmaster, please guide me where the Origin Space-time is.” “Right now. I’m already prepared!”
 Han Jue waved his hand and pointed, sending Fang Liang into the Origin Space-time. It didn’t matter if Fang Liang could succeed.
 The Origin Space-time erased all karma. The
 soul fragment that Ji Xianshen had left with Han Jue had already disappeared, which meant that Fang Liang could die.
 Han Jue was already indifferent to life and death. He couldn’t protect all the disciples forever. He was already invincible. If he was biased like this, the Hidden Sect would
 dominate the Endless Era. He would suffer a backlash sooner or later. Any unification would end eventually. Han Jue had already jumped out of the Hidden Sect and wouldn’t be especially biased. The essence of the current Hidden Sect had
 already been disbanded, but with its soul around, all the personal disciples had their own forces. They would fight sooner or later. Han Jue stood up and disappeared from the Daoist temple.
 Heavenly Dao.
 upper echelons of the Heavenly Dao were his
 slaves. Han Yunjin had also been promoted to one of the most powerful Heavenly Dao Sages. At this moment, he was playing with a mirror
 in his Daoist temple. Many images flashed in the mirror and reflected in his eyes.
 Han Jue quietly appeared behind him. The
 situation of various descendants of the Han family appeared in the mirror.
 It turned out that Han Yunjin’s favorite thing was to screen the bloodlines passed down in the Han family and choose those with outstanding potential to nurture. Previously, Chen Jue, who had obtained the Creation Heaven’s Chosen, had received his secret help, so he disdained the immortals.
 Han Yunjin nodded from time to time and smiled in satisfaction.
 Han Jue sighed in his heart. This kid really
 didn’t have the bearing of an expert at all. However, this was also good. His children all wanted to be the strongest. Wouldn’t they have to treat Han Jue as their enemy in the future?


 “This kid is not bad.
 “Hmph, the Han family actually has such a vile descendant. You’re courting death!
 “Sigh, how pitiful. You’ve been alone all your life. Fortunately, I saw it and came to save you.
 “This child is not bad, either. He knows how to endure.”
 Han Yunjin muttered to himself. It was quite funny in Han Jue’s eyes.
 After a long while…
 Han Yunjin was still immersed. Seeing that he probably wouldn’t end his spying for a long time, Han Jue coughed lightly.
 Han Yunjin was frightened. He turned around and saw that it was his father. Stunned, he immediately knelt down to kowtow.
 “Greetings… Father…”
 Han Yunjin was extremely nervous and regretful. Did his father see his ugly state just now?
 His father rarely came to see him. He didn’t expect to see him spying on his descendants.
 Han Yunjin was extremely embarrassed and wished he could find a hole to hide in.
 Han Jue didn’t tease him. After all, the father and son weren’t as close as he was to Chu Xiaoqi. He began to ask about what he was doing recently.
 Han Yunjin became more and more excited. Was his father visiting him?
 He knew that his father was the strongest person and would not visit him for no reason.
 After chatting for several hours, Han Jue began to preach the Dao.
 The Dao voice of the Creator Lord directly
 made Han Yunjin, a Great Dao Sage, fall into a
 state of enlightenment.
 After a certain period of time.
 Han Yunjin opened his eyes and felt that the
 entire world had changed.
 He thought that his father had already left,
 but he discovered that he was playing with his mirror in the distance.
 Han Yunjin hurriedly walked over and bowed.
 He scratched his head and said, “This is a Dharma treasure I created with the Han
 bloodline karma as the foundation. It’s useless. I just can see the descendants of the
 Han family. Sorry, Father.”
 With Han Jue’s ability, he didn’t need such a Dharma treasure at all. He could see all his descendants scattered in the myriad worlds at a glance.
 Although Han Yunjin was so flustered and uneasy in front of him, he was in the Heavenly Dao. His dignity did not belong to the older generation of Sages.
 Han Jue smiled. “Not bad. Speaking of which, it’s all thanks to you that the Han family can prosper. Although you don’t have the
 cultivation potential of your brothers and sisters, I’ve always seen your efforts. I’m very
 glad. You’re the one I’m most satisfied with and looking forward to among my children.” These words made Han Yunjin extremely excited and even brought tears to his eyes.
 He was not acting. He was being sincere. Ever since he was young, his father had never praised him like this. He had also been
 looking forward to this.
 He didn’t lack anything now. What he lacked the most was his father’s recognition, the recognition of the strongest.
 Han Yunjin tried his best to control his
 emotions, feeling that his hundreds of millions of years of hard work had not been in
 vain.
 Han Jue left after giving Han Yunjin a Chaotic Supreme Treasure. He didn’t order him to do anything in the future. This kid had already done well and didn’t need to be taught. After his father left, the hall fell silent. Han
 Yunjin took a deep breath and his eyes became firm.
 He understood what his father meant!
 His father wanted him to continue developing the Han family and praised him for handing
 over the power of the Han family to him. Perhaps this was his method to attain the Dao.
 Others used the world to attain the Dao, but he might be able to use his family to attain
 the Dao!
 …
 The Dao Mystic Realm was surrounded by thousands of mortal worlds. These mortal worlds all overlapped. Above them was the Immortal World, and they were all cultivators above the Mahayana Realm. Below them was the mortal world where all living beings
 suffered.
 rocks condensed into a land that kept
 expanding.
 In an Immortal World.
 Chu Xiaoqi rode the clouds and mist, roaming
 the world.
 He looked around for Tang Wan after
 ascending. However, there were countless women with this name in the Immortal
 World. According to their looks, they were still useless.
 Chu Xiaoqi traveled the Immortal World and
 searched for hundreds of years but did not
 find any traces of Tang Wan. However, he was not disappointed because he had obtained many opportunities and his strength had been increasing rapidly.
 Even he felt that the experiences over the
 On this day, Chu Xiaoqi came to a land of immortals.
 All the Immortal Worlds had immortal orthodoxies that were responsible for ruling the Three Realms. This Immortal World also
 had them. The immortals were collectively called the Divine Race.
 The Divine Clan was about to recruit immortals in this immortal land. Chu Xiaoqi felt that if he became an immortal, he might
 be able to find Tang Wan. At least, it would be easier than his current identity. Immortals could see through the three worlds.
 he was not the most outstanding one. The most outstanding person in this Immortal Ascension Meeting was a man younger than him. His name was Chen Jue, and his cultivation level far exceeded his.
 This was the first time Chu Xiaoqi had encountered such a genius.
 He had broadened his horizons.
 was still extremely glorious. Chu Xiaoqi often heard legends about him.
 Unknowingly, surpassing Chen Jue had
 Above the white clouds, the palace was like a sea of stars in a courtyard.
 Han Tuo and Han Yunjin were drinking.
 Han Yunjin asked curiously, “This Chu Xiaoqi
 is your disciple? His potential is average.” Chen Jue and Chu Xiaoqi met because of their manipulation.
 Han Yunjin smiled. “I only dared to agree
 because you said so. Third Sister thinks highly
 of Chen Jue. She stopped the Heavenly Court
 from recruiting him.”
 Between Big Brother and Third Sister, he still knew who had the highest say. Han Ling would probably not blame him. Han Yunjin changed the topic and asked, “But
 then again, the Dao Mystic Realm is controlled by the Formless World, after all.
 Could it be…”
 Formless World wouldn’t reject other mighty figures from stuffing geniuses into the Dao Mystic Realm. He couldn’t wait for this.
 Han Yunjin was worried that Chen Jue would die in the Dao Mystic Realm.
 Han Tuo said, “Don’t worry. I have a good relationship with Formless World.”
 Formless World was someone under the Formless Transcendent Deity and was loyal to Han Jue. Formless World naturally wouldn’t go against the Han family.
 Han Yunjin did not know about the Dao Creator level, so he was worried. However, he was relieved after hearing Han Tuo’s promise.
 Han Tuo was still very reliable. At least, he was more reliable than his other siblings. At this moment, a figure flew over and knelt down beside the two of them.
 “Sage, Sage Concubine Yuan is in trouble. You
 have to save her!”
 Han Yunjin frowned. Sage Concubine Yuan
 was a Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal. How could it be difficult for her to give birth? He immediately bid farewell to Han Tuo and left with his subordinates.
 Han Tuo originally did not care. However, he suddenly frowned and turned around. “This feeling… How can this be…”
 He wasn’t the only one. The other descendants of the Han family also felt it.
 Primordial Chaos.
 In the dark hall. Han Huang, who was meditating, suddenly opened his eyes.


 “This feeling… Primordial Fiendcelestial… No, it’s not the Primordial Fiendcelestial. To be able to resonate with my bloodline, it must be a descendant of the Han family…”
 Han Huang’s gaze pierced through the
 Primordial Chaos and landed on the Heavenly Dao.
 At this moment, in Han Yunjin’s Dao Field. Han Yunjin quickly entered a chamber. He appeared at the edge of the bed and looked at the woman lying on it.
 The woman’s face was in pain and she couldn’t stop sweating. She held her stomach with both hands. Red light shone from her stomach, illuminating her blood vessels and meridians. One could see the fetus struggling violently.
 “Husband…”
 Sage Concubine Yuan called out with an aggrieved expression when she saw him.
 Han Yunjin frowned. “What’s going on? You can’t give birth?”
 Sage Concubine Yuan’s eyes were filled with fear. She said with a trembling voice, “He’s absorbing my Dharmic powers and resisting being born. My Dharmic powers are no longer controlled by me…’
 She had given birth to more than ten children for Han Yunjin, but she had never encountered such a situation.
 Han Yunjin reached out and pressed down on Sage Concubine Yuan’s stomach. He wanted to use his Dharmic powers to move the child out, but just as his Dharmic powers touched the fetus, he instantly felt a burning pain, startling him so much that he subconsciously retracted his Dharmic powers.
 Impossible!
 He was a Great Dao Sage!
 An unborn fetus could hurt him?
 Han Yunjin did not believe it and continued to try, but the burning sensation was too strong. It could even touch the soul.
 Han Yunjin panicked.
 At this moment, a figure appeared beside Han Yunjin. It was Han Jue.
 Han Jue’s eyes narrowed. He directly pulled the fetus out. Sage Concubine Yuan wailed and collapsed on the bed. He took the fetus with his left hand and waved his right hand, using the power of the Lord to heal her injuries.
 Han Yunjin heaved a sigh of relief upon
 Sage Concubine Yuan.
 Han Jue looked down at the fetus. It was even
 smaller than a normal fetus of a mortal. It was only the size of a palm and was glowing red. There was a strange smile on the fetus’
 face.
 After the fetus was born, it didn’t wail. Instead, it stretched out its hands and grabbed at Han Jue. It giggled terrifyingly. Han Jue was expressionless. A notification floated in front of him.
 to the Primordial Fiendcelestial.]
 A new bloodline finally appeared…
 Every era had different outstanding races. It
 was also possible for the Endless Era to give birth to talents that surpassed the past.
 After Han Yunjin walked over, Han Jue handed him his child.
 As for this grandson’s potential, Han Jue didn’t plan to seal it.
 “This child is extraordinary. You have to discipline him well,” Han Jue said meaningfully. The child was not that strong after being born. Previously, he was mainly protected by the basic rules in his mother’s
 womb.
 Han Yunjin looked at the child he was holding with mixed emotions. He felt lingering fear at the scene just now.
 He couldn’t help but ask, “Father, will there really be no hidden danger?”
 “Yes, so I need you to discipline him.”
 With that, Han Jue disappeared.
 He was born with the instinct to destroy
 everything. It looked evil, but that was not necessarily the case. Everything had two
 sides. After all, he was his grandson. Han Jue
 naturally couldn’t kill him in one go. Sage Concubine Yuan had already recovered under the healing of the power of the Creator
 Lord. She came to Han Yunjin’s side and took the child. She was no longer as afraid as before and only had a doting expression. She said softly, “Your father said just now that we need to discipline him well. Any child can take the wrong path. Let’s not be too wary of him and treat him as a normal child.”
 Han Yunjin was silent.
 For some reason, he inexplicably thought of
 In the Immortal World, above the Nine Heavens, clouds surrounded a Heavenly Door
 standing on the top of the clouds. Chu Xiaoqi was standing guard.
 He clutched his chest and frowned.
 “What’s going on? What’s this feeling?” Chu Xiaoqi inexplicably panicked. His soul felt cold. This feeling was unprecedented. The Immortal Soldier beside him asked him
 with concern if he needed to rest. He did not force himself. He bid farewell and left.
 After returning to his residence, Chu Xiaoqi immediately circulated his energy to heal his injuries. However, the strange feeling
 disappeared just as he started. “Strange…”
 Chu Xiaoqi couldn’t figure it out.
 He remained vigilant for the next period of
 time. Only after the feeling no longer appeared after a long period of time did he no longer worry.
 He wasn’t the only one. All of Han Jue’s descendants felt it.
 The Ten Divine Stars even returned to the
 third Dao Field to visit him.
 Han Jue didn’t see them and only said, “You’ll
 know in the future.”
 The Ten Divine Stars couldn’t figure it out.
 They quickly left the Dao Field. They also had their own great ambitions. Han Jue silently paid attention to Han
 Yunjin’s child and named him Han Liang.
 This name…
 How meaningful!
 Han Liang had been lively since he was young
 and liked to cause trouble everywhere. It made Han Jue inexplicably think of the legendary Nezha.
 The story of Nezha had long disappeared in history, but Han Jue still remembered that there were children like Nezha in every era.
 Rebellion was human nature, but normal people were bound by moral standards. Although Han Liang liked to cause trouble,
 under Han Yunjin’s restrictions, he did not hurt the innocent.
 For the time being, it was difficult to imagine
 that this kid was born with the duty to destroy everything.
 Han Jue suddenly had a bold thought. Should he use the Creation Heaven’s Chosen? Perhaps it could increase Han Liang’s talent.
 Han Jue looked at Han Liang’s future. His future had many possibilities. Most of them, he walked the evil path, just like Han Huang. However, in some futures, he maintained his rationality and bottom line. In one of the
 possible futures, he was a Sage, a true Sage who saved all living beings. Interesting.
 Born to destroy, he traveled the world but did
 good deeds.
 Han Jue became interested in Han Liang. As for the Creation Heaven’s Chosen, he should keep it. He would gather a hundred
 attempts in the future and use them together. The descendants who had already reached the Great Dao Sage Realm knew about Han Liang.
 The bloodline resonance caused by him was too oppressive. Therefore, on Han Liang’s path of growth, strange clansmen often came to visit him.
 The one who treated him the best was Han Qing’er. She even brought him out to play. A thousand years later, Han Liang looked to
 be only five or six years old, as if he would never grow up.
 Han Liang was not troubled by this. Like Han
 Huang, he did not care about the opinions of all living beings. On this day.
 Han Liang was playing on the Heavenly Dao’s
 Buzhou Divine Mountain. Han Yunjin was
 quite relieved since Han Yu was also on the mountain. A black vortex suddenly appeared in front of
 Han Liang. A huge black hand stretched out
 and grabbed him. Before this kid could even shout, he vanished without a trace. Han Yu appeared and quickly entered the black vortex, chasing after him. This was his little ancestor. How could he disappear in Buzhou Mountain?!


 Passing through the black vortex, Han Yu arrived in the spatial turbulence. As the Great Dao Supreme, Han Yu was not confused by the spatial illusion and quickly tracked Han Liang’s figure.
 Han Liang was hugged by a masked gray-robed man and could not break free.
 The gray-robed man’s mask was clearly a Chaotic Supreme Treasure. Han Yu could not spy on his true appearance. Even his aura felt ethereal.
 If he did not see it with his own eyes, he would probably think that Han Liang was traveling through the spatial turbulence alone.
 Han Yu quickly approached. Han Liang’s eyes widened in surprise when he saw him.
 The gray-robed man turned around and waved his sleeve. Endless blood wind drowned Han Yu, but he did not panic. He used a Divine Might Great Heaven Palm to disperse it and even severed this spatial turbulence.
 Han Yu reached out and wrapped Han Liang with his Dharmic powers. He wanted to pull him over, but an extremely powerful force dispersed his Dharmic powers and even injured his soul.
 Han Yu frowned and felt uneasy. With this exchange, he knew that he was not the other party’s match.
 However, He did not retreat. He had to save Han Liang.
 Han Liang was born with a bloodline suppression on the other clansmen. Such potential was the fortune of the Han family and could not be lost.
 Han Yu attacked again.
 The gray-robed man suddenly stopped and canceled out Han Yu’s Mystical Power. “Sage Han Yu, you shouldn’t have stopped me.”
 Han Yu found his voice unfamiliar and asked in a low voice, “You want to be enemies with the Han family?”
 The gray-robed man said, “On the contrary, I’m saving the Han family. This child can’t be left alive.”
 Han Yu frowned.
 The gray-robed man raised his right hand and drew a semicircle in front of him. In an
 instant, a blood-colored half-moon condensed. Han Yu’s gaze subconsciously landed on the blood-colored half-moon and he was in a daze.
 Han Yu opened his eyes and discovered that he had arrived in a blood-colored void. In the distance, he could see many dilapidated worlds. Corpses were everywhere.
 This was a blank domain. The reason why it
 was blood-colored was that there were too
 many killings.
 Han Yu saw a figure. It was Han Liang.
 This Han Liang looked to be only twelve or thirteen years old. He wore a blood-patterned black robe. The crisscrossing blood patterns constantly emitted a blood mist. This black robe was slightly wide. His long hair was disheveled, and a cruel smile hung on his handsome face.
 Han Yu was not shocked to see Han Liang. He
 realized that this was an illusion. What he
 saw and heard was not important. What he had to do was leave the illusion as soon as
 possible.
 When Han Liang rushed in front of him, he still did not care.
 Boom-
 Han Liang’s palm pierced through Han Yu’s chest. The extremely realistic pain moved Han
 Yu.
 Disbelief appeared on his face.
 Han Liang was absorbing his Dharmic
 powers!
 This was not a fake illusion!
 Impossible!
 …
 In the third Dao Field.
 Han Jue opened his eyes. Han Yu and Han Yunjin were waiting to see him outside the Daoist temple.
 Han Jue let them in.
 Han Yunjin bowed and said anxiously,
 “Father, my son Han Liang has been captured!”
 Han Yu told him about his pursuit of the gray-robed man. He hid the future of Han Liang he had seen.
 Han Jue was not surprised and said calmly, “I already know about this.”
 Seeing Han Jue’s calm reaction, Han Yunjin
 couldn’t help but ask, “Father, what should we do about this?”
 Han Yunjin had countless children, so he naturally did not show preference to Han Liang. At first, he was still very vigilant, so he
 With that, a small head poked out from behind Han Jue. Who else could it be but Han
 Liang? The Daoist temple blocked their senses, so
 Han Yunjin and Han Yu didn’t sense Han Liang’s existence after entering. In front of Han Jue, they didn’t dare to look around.
 “Liang’er!” Han Yunjin shouted in surprise. Han Yu also heaved a sigh of relief. Han Liang didn’t pounce on his father.
 Instead, he lay on Han Jue’s shoulder and giggled at his father.
 Seeing his smile, Han Yu could not help but
 shiver.
 Han Jue said, “Go back. Liang’er will stay here with me.”
 Han Yunjin hesitated. Seeing that his youngest son did not want to go with him at all, he sighed and left.
 Han Yu also wanted to say something, but he
 suddenly felt relieved upon seeing Han Jue’s
 gaze. Perhaps their progenitor, the strongest existence, knew everything.
 Han Yu also left, but Han Yunjin did not leave
 the Dao Field immediately. Instead, he went to visit his mother, Li Yao.
 Han Jue hugged Han Liang and smiled. “Little
 fellow, don’t run around in the future. Many people want to capture you, including yourself.”
 Han Liang tilted his head and asked,
 “Grandpa, why would I capture myself?”
 Han Jue smiled and didn’t say anything. He rubbed his head.
 In the Daoist temple next door.
 Han Yunjin faced Li Yao and expressed his
 worry.
 The two of them sat facing each other. They
 did not look like mother and son, but more like siblings.
 Li Yao’s cold face revealed a smile. “Don’t
 worry. Liang’er is by your father’s side now. This is your father’s concern for you.” Han Yunjin was stunned and came to a realization.
 If even his father could not control Han
 Liang, no one in the world would be able to protect him.
 Li Yao continued, “You already have enough descendants. You don’t have to have children anymore.”
 Han Yunjin blushed and hurriedly bid farewell.
 Li Yao smiled and closed her eyes to continue cultivating.
 Among Han Jue’s Dao Companions, she was
 Three thousand years later.
 In the Dao Field.
 Han Liang rode the clouds. Sometimes, he transformed into a Kun Peng, sometimes into an Azure Dragon, causing the disciples on the
 ground to exclaim and clap from time to time. These disciples’ cultivation levels far exceeded Han Liang’s. The reason why they were so
 shocked was not only to please him but also because of Han Liang’s potential. This kid was already at the Deity Realm. He
 had grown too quickly!
 Han Liang had always looked like a youth and
 his temperament would never grow up, so he was deeply loved by the disciples. “Liang’er, Third Aunt is here!”
 Han Qing’er flew over and hugged him. Han Liang looked disgusted and struggled to get out of her grasp. “Go away. I don’t want to play with you!”
 In the beginning, Han Liang quite liked Han
 Qing’er, but every time she came, she would
 trample on him, causing him to feel more and more disgusted.
 No matter how Han Liang struggled, he could not escape Han Qing’er.
 On the other side, Jiang Jueshi went to visit
 Han Jue.
 After Han Jue became invincible, he no longer deliberately entered seclusion. Furthermore, very few people dared to disturb him.
 Jiang Jueshi kowtowed respectfully after entering the temple.
 He looked up at Han Jue and said, “Master, discovered something in the cycle of reincarnation. A mysterious force is
 I
 accumulating power in space-time and even
 mentioned the Dark Forbidden Lord. I’m
 afraid it’s not a good thing.” He told Han Jue what he knew. He left after
 Han Jue expressed his understanding. He only
 Han Jue looked at Han Liang.
 “I didn’t expect you, Ji Xianshen, and Heavenly Venerate Xun to be together. How interesting,” Han Jue muttered to himself. Heavenly Venerate Xun was the future Dao Creator from the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity. He was also Han Jue’s descendant. But that was not Han Liang. He was only related to him.
