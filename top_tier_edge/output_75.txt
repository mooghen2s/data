 “Really? Let’s wait until you see the outside world.”
 Han Jue shook his head and laughed, not taking it seriously.
 He waved his sleeve and brought Han Ling to the main Dao Field. He let him take a walk in the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 Han Ling returned in less than two hours and said that there was nothing to see there.
 Han Jue then brought her to the third Dao Field to meet the personal disciples.
 Li Yao and Dao Comprehension Sword were very surprised to see Han Ling. They pulled her and showed her around.
 Han Jue informed the other Fiendcelestials, and they arrived in front of the Daoist temple in less than three breaths of time.
 Han Jue led his daughter out of the Daoist temple and introduced her to the disciples.
 “She’s Master’s fourth daughter, right?”
  “Hello, Junior Sister Ling’er!”
 “What should I call you? Uncle-Master or Aunt-Master?”
 “Hahaha, she’s really good-looking. As expected of Master’s daughter.”
 “How old is she? Why is she already a Sage?”
 “Think about Han Huang. You shouldn’t be surprised.”
 Han Ling was not nervous upon facing the dozens of fellow disciples’ eager gazes. She took the initiative to greet them.
 The Fiendcelestials had already found their own Dao. Han Jue didn’t need to preach the Dao to them. He came this time to inform them. Presumably, before long, the news would spread to the personal disciples wandering in the Chaos.
 That day, Han Jue and his daughter left. The disciples dispersed and continued cultivating.
 In the Daoist temple.
 Li Yao fell into deep thought.
 Indeed, Han Jue came too few times!
 Although their relationship would not change, feelings needed to be nurtured.
 Han Jue left the Dao Field with Han Ling and started to travel the Chaos.
 He left their soul fragments in the third Dao Field to revive if necessary.
 It seemed peaceful now, but Han Jue felt it better to hold back. Wouldn’t it be a tragedy if the Dao Creator suddenly went mad and wanted to mess with him?
 The higher one’s cultivation level was, the more cautious they had to be!
 Unless he was already invincible.
 The father and daughter stood on a purple cloud as Han Jue introduced the Chaos to her.
 Han Jue talked about his experiences after briefly explaining the situation in the Chaos.
 Han Ling’s eyes lit up. The purple cloud moved very quickly.
 They arrived at the Great Dao Tower’s domain just as Han Jue finished telling the story of how he attained the Dao.
 Han Jue sent a voice transmission to Zhou Fan asking him to receive them.
 Zhou Fan was already on his own, after all. Han Jue didn’t want to embarrass him by barging in.
 Soon, Zhou Fan was ready and invited him to the top of the tower.
 Two other people were in the hall apart from him. One was Mo Fuchou, and the other was a black-robed man who looked 70-80% similar to Zhou Fan.
 “Master!”
 Zhou Fan immediately knelt down when he saw Han Jue.
 The man in black also knelt down. Mo Fuchou was very uneasy and did not know what to do.
 Han Jue smiled. “Alright, get up. Brother Mo, long time no see. How have you been?”
 Mo Fuchou was relieved. He smiled and said, “Very good. Zhou Fan treats me like a brother, but I don’t deserve to be called Brother Mo.”
  Han Jue smiled. “It’s fine.”
 Zhou Fan hurriedly asked, “This is?”
 “My daughter, Han Ling, was born a hundred thousand years ago. I brought her out today.” Han Jue smiled and introduced his daughter to them.
 Han Ling bowed. “Greetings, Senior Zhou.”
 Zhou Fan beamed. “Junior Sister Ling’er is impressive. She became a Sage at a hundred thousand years old. She’s much stronger than my son.”
 The black-robed man looked at Han Ling in surprise.
 Everyone sat down after some pleasantries.
 Zhou Fan began to brag about his Great Dao Tower. This was the first time the black-robed man saw his father so excited. He was even more curious about Han Jue now.
 “Divine Might Heavenly Sage… He doesn’t look strong…”
 The black-robed man thought to himself. Then, he looked at Han Ling.
 Han Ling glanced at him, scaring him so much that he hurriedly retracted his gaze.
 Han Jue also noticed this scene, but he didn’t show it or care.
 It was impossible for the two of them. The difference in seniority and cultivation level was huge.
 He believed that Zhou Fan also knew about this and would not let his son act recklessly.
 The current Great Dao Tower was also a major force in the Chaotic Domain. It had more than a hundred subordinate worlds and two Great Dao Sages guarding it. One was Zhou Fan, and the other was a Chaotic mighty figure that Zhou Fan had roped in.
 Han Jue listened quietly and didn’t express his opinion.
 After Zhou Fan finished speaking, Han Jue smiled and said, “That’s right. I don’t care how you develop. Just remember where you came from.”
 Zhou Fan chuckled. “I’ll always be a disciple of the Hidden Sect. If not for the connections of the Hidden Sect and your prestige, how could my journey be so smooth?”
 Han Jue shook his head and laughed. Then, he gave Mo Fuchou and the black-robed man a Dharma treasure each as a greeting gift.
 That day, Han Jue and his daughter left.
 Zhou Fan and the other two stood by the tower and watched them leave.
 The man in black sighed.
 Zhou Fan glanced at him and said coldly, “Don’t think too much. I had the urge to dig out your dog eyes. That’s your elder. How can you look at her like that? Don’t think too highly of yourself. You’re not worthy.”
 The black-robed man’s face turned red. “Why not? I can cultivate diligently!”
 Mo Fuchou was amused, as if he was watching a show.
 The black-robed man’s expression changed. He actually didn’t want anything. It was just love at first sight.
 “The number one prodigy of the Chaos… You said that I can’t, but I have to try!”
 The black-robed man clenched his fists in anger.
 He wanted to slap his father’s face!
 In the Chaos.
 Han Jue and Han Ling continued forward on the purple cloud.
  Han Jue smiled. “We’re meeting your brothers and sister now.”
 Han Ling asked nervously, “Will they like
 me?”
 Previously, she was generous when facing outsiders. But she became nervous now that she was going to see relatives she had never met.
 “Yes, my Ling’er is adored by everyone. Look at your Senior Zhou’s son. He’s so obsessed with you that he can’t talk.” Han Jue smiled.
 “Father, don’t tease me.”
 Han Ling blushed in embarrassment.
 Han Jue said, “You have to choose your sweetheart well in the future. You can’t embarrass your father. At least, he has to be worthy of you.”
 “Father, hurry up. We’ll go back and cultivate after meeting my brothers and sister.”


 Heavenly Court!
 Han Jue and the Evil Heavenly Emperor drank and chatted in the imperial garden. Han Ling sat at the side obediently and silently, but she was not distracted. She listened carefully to their conversation.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor looked at her and sighed. “Han Jue, your children are really talented. If not for the fact that Ling’er still has to cultivate with you, I would have poached her to the Heavenly Court to be an immortal.”
 Han Jue smiled and said, “That depends on her own thoughts.”
 Han Ling replied, “Thank you for your kind intentions, Your Majesty. I plan to cultivate by Father’s side forever. I’m not interested in wandering the Chaos.”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor raised his eyebrows and sized her up in surprise.
 Han Jue was glad. This little girl was really
 good.
 He would be a little jealous if all his children were poached by the Evil Heavenly Emperor.
  At this moment, Han Huang, Han Qing’er, and Jiang Jueshi rushed over.
 The three of them quickly bowed when they saw Han Jue.
 Han Jue smiled and introduced Han Ling to them.
 “Sister!”
 Han Qing’er was pleasantly surprised and immediately held Han Ling’s arm.
 Han Huang also felt the closeness of his bloodline and immediately took out a Dharma treasure as a greeting gift.
 However, Jiang Jueshi was slightly moved. He felt a familiar aura from Han Ling.
 Great Creation!
 This woman was also an Innate Great Creation!
 Jiang Jueshi couldn’t help but look at Han Jue with reverence.
 Master could already impart Great Creation to his children?
 For some reason, he suddenly felt that his master was a little like the old master in his memories.
 Perhaps he was thinking too much.
 After all, millions of years had passed.
 Han Jue asked Jiang Jueshi and the other two to sit down. Then, he asked about their cultivation.
 “Father, I’m only a step away from the Great Dao Supreme Realm. I’ll definitely be able to attain it before the Chaotic Assembly. I want the Eternal Peak, but I might have to represent the Heavenly Court. In any case, you have countless disciples under you and I’m your son. It’s a win-win situation, but reputation is more important to the Heavenly Court.” Han Huang chuckled.
 Han Jue smiled and nodded. He thought to himself that the Evil Heavenly Emperor was quite capable. He probably poured his heart out to Han Huang to make this rash kid care so much.
 “Not bad.”
 Han Jue nodded slightly and looked at his disciple.
 Jiang Jueshi said, “My current cultivation is at the mid-stage Great Dao Primordial Chaos Realm. I don’t dare to think about the Eternal Peak anymore. Junior Huang is too powerful. However, I’m definitely one of the Chaotic Ten Absolutes.”
 Han Ling stared at him in deep thought.
 Han Jue smiled and said, “You and Ling’er are both born with Innate Great Creation. You have to cultivate well and not be caught up by Ling’er.” As expected.
 Jiang Jueshi thought to himself.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor’s eyes lit up. “Innate Great Creation? Could it be that the mysterious prodigy the entire Chaos is talking about is Ling’er? Calculating the time, the two of them indeed descended at the same time.”
 Han Huang couldn’t help but size up his sister again.
 Han Qing’er’s eyes lit up. “Wow! Sister, you have a Great Creation like Senior Jiang? His Great Reincarnation Creation Technique is so abnormal. What Great Creation do you have?”
 Han Ling looked at her father.
 Han Jue said, “I can’t say for the time being. Ling’er will cultivate with me and show it one day.”
 Jiang Jueshi asked curiously, “Then, will Junior Ling’er participate in this Chaotic Assembly?”
 Han Jue shook his head.
 Everyone looked at Han Jue.
 Han Jue smiled and said, “It’s alright. How’s the discussion about Huang’er’s marriage?”
 Hearing this, Han Huang shuddered and said excitedly, “Father, I don’t want to marry! In my eyes, all living beings are not the same as me. How can I have improper relationships with them!”
 Han Ling’s eyes lit up and she looked at him in surprise.
 So she was not the only one. Second Brother was the same.
 Han Jue showed a frown.
 Han Qing’er hurriedly tried to persuade him. “Second Brother, when has Father ever asked you for anything? Others can’t wait to do it!”
 Han Huang’s heart skipped a beat when he saw his father frown.
 That’s right.
 This was the only thing his father had told him to do.
 Han Huang struggled for a moment and gritted his teeth. “Alright!”
 Han Jue finally relaxed.
 Just like that, Han Jue and his daughter stayed in the Heavenly Dao. Han Ling was pulled around by Han Qing’er. Han Huang and Jiang Jueshi entered seclusion again to prepare for the Chaotic Assembly.
 Han Jue and the Evil Heavenly Emperor discussed the Dao. It was said to be a Dao discussion, but it was actually Han Jue’s suggestion. The Evil Heavenly Emperor happily accepted it.
 At the bottom of the Chaos, at a place with boundless mist.
 Dao Sovereign, Zhao Xuanyuan, Jiang Yi, and Lao Dan cultivated around a small spring.
 This small spring was less than five feet in diameter. Spring water surged out from the ground. The water surface surged slightly and mist rose from the edge. It looked no different from the spring water in the mortal world, but it was especially abrupt here.
 was
 There was no grass or life in a radius of ten thousand miles. There was only one water source.
 Zhao Xuanyuan opened his eyes and said excitedly, “My cultivation level increased so quickly!”
 Jiang Yi smiled and said, “Whose cultivation hasn’t? My Divine Yang Indestructible Body has increased greatly. Not only my cultivation level, but my potential is also increasing.”
 Lao Dan opened his eyes and sighed. “It’s indeed impressive. A huge opportunity, a huge opportunity. However, it’s only enough for the four of us.”
 “How is that possible! I have nothing to do with the Three Pure Sacred World. How many times have I said it!”
 “Hehe. Then why are you so nervous when my master defeated Laozi?”
 “After all, we are the same person. How can I not be worried?”
 Zhao Xuanyuan and Lao Dan began to bicker habitually.
 At this moment…
 The water surface suddenly fluctuated and a figure appeared.
 “Look!” Jiang Yi exclaimed. The other three immediately looked at the water.
 The strange figure that appeared in the water was covered in white fur. It had a human-like upper body and arms like branches. Its white fur twisted with the water.
 The four of them frowned. This was the first time they had seen such a phenomenon.
  At this moment, the white-haired figure suddenly opened its eyes. A strange green light burst out, terrifying.
 It opened its mouth, revealing two rows of sharp teeth like shark teeth, as if it was talking.
 Dao Sovereign and the other three couldn’t understand or see through it.
 Zhao Xuanyuan suddenly shivered and said, “Everyone, do you still remember the Ancient Desolate?”
 Whoosh
 The four of them jumped back at the same time, away from the small spring.
 Jiang Yi swallowed. “Should we leave?” Dao Sovereign frowned. “Are you willing to give up such a treasure?” Zhao Xuanyuan covered his forehead. “Here we go again.” “Indeed.” Lao Dan sighed.
 Suddenly!
 The white-furred figure actually crawled out of the spring. First, it was its arm, then its head. The hole formed by the spring was clearly far smaller than its body. It was stuck in the spring, quietly staring at Dao Sovereign and the other three.


 “What should we do?” Jiang Yi asked in a low voice. He stared at the white-haired figure, afraid that it would suddenly attack.
 The other three were the same. They didn’t dare to let their guard down.
 Dao Sovereign frowned. As the leader of the four, he made the decisions.
 !!
 Moreover, the strength of this white-haired figure was still unknown. How could he be frightened away?
 Dao Sovereign’s eyes narrowed. His right hand behind his waist clenched into a fist. In an instant, the space around the white-haired figure froze. Even the white-haired figure couldn’t move.
 “Chase!” Dao Sovereign shouted in a low voice. The white-haired figure shattered with the ice crystals around it, turning into mist and dissipating
 Zhao Xuanyuan and Jiang Yi were stunned. It ended just like that?
 At this moment, another arm covered in white fur emerged from the spring. The white-furred figure crawled out again and stared at them like before.
 Lao Dan frowned.
 “Do you want… more…”
 The white-furred figure suddenly let out an obscure voice, but it automatically transformed into a language that the four of them could understand.
 Lao Dan frowned. “You want us to go in?”
 “Who are you?”
 “I don’t remember… If you help me, I’ll give you more…”
 Dao Sovereign and the other two looked at each other.
 Could it be that this fellow was sealed in the spring water?
 What was hidden under the spring?
 The white-haired figure trembled. He raised his hand and said, “Below…”
 Lao Dan came to Dao Sovereign’s side and asked in a low voice, “What do you think?”
 This was the greatest reason he became the leader. He was the first to rush forward every time!
 “I’ll go down with you!” Jiang Yi said in a low voice with a firm gaze.
 Zhao Xuanyuan said helplessly, “How can you go down alone? We won’t be able to save you if something really happens. Our strength will be dispersed. Let’s go together. Four Great Dao Sages won’t die no matter what!”
 Lao Dan’s expression changed. “I have to go down too?”
 “Nonsense! Are we brothers?”
 “I’m your grandfather, okay!”
 The four of them bickered for a while before they suppressed their nervousness and walked towards the little spring.
 Third Dao Field
 Han Jue and Han Ling appeared here. Han Ling heaved a sigh of relief and smiled upon looking at the familiar surroundings.
 “You dislike the Chaos so much?” Han Jue found it funny.
 Han Jue sat on the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus and said helplessly, “Women can’t always follow their father.”
 Han Ling also sat down. “Then, I’ll go out when I surpass you.”
 “That’s impossible.”
 “That’s even better.”
 Han Ling stuck out her tongue obediently.
 Han Jue didn’t say anything else and started cultivating.
 The father and daughter closed their eyes.
 When he opened his eyes again, a hundred thousand years had already passed.
 Han Jue began to observe the Primordial World while Han Ling walked out and greeted her mother, Xuan Qingjun. After all, they were mother and daughter. She should go talk with her when she was free.
 The more Ultimate Origin Qi there was, the stronger Han Jue’s Dharmic powers became.
 Apart from that, there were already more than five hundred Chaotic Fiendcelestials in the Primordial World. The remaining Fiendcelestial Qi was still being nurtured. It was not far from nurturing three thousand Fiendcelestials.
 Han Jue estimated that he shouldn’t be able to gather three thousand Fiendcelestials. After all, there were already nearly a hundred Chaotic Fiendcelestials in the Chaos. Most of them were in the second Dao Field.
 Han Jue started to check his emails.
 [Your disciple Dao Sovereign was attacked by Chaotic Resentful Devil] x10922281
 [Your disciple Zhao Xuanyuan was attacked by Chaotic Resentful Devil] x9873221
 (Your son Han Huang’s cultivation has broken through. His cultivation has increased greatly.) [Your disciple Zhou Fan has entered the bottom of the Chaos.]
 (Your good friend Azure Heaven Mystic was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure and was severely injured.]
 (Your good friend, the Ultimate God of Punishment, was cursed by a mysterious curse.]
 (Your good friend Holy Mother of Order has absorbed the Supreme Rule power and her cultivation has increased.]
 So lucky?
 He pinched his fingers to deduce and discovered that he could not deduce their location.
 Interesting.
 Han Jue could already easily suppress a million Great Dao Sages, but there were still some places in the Chaos that could not be spied on.
 There were still many old monsters hidden in the Chaos. Han Jue felt several auras stronger than the Ultimate God of Punishment when the Nine-Headed Divine Spirit attacked the third Dao Field.
 They were all old schemers, and they were even more cowardly than him.
 Han Jue continued reading the emails.
 Evil Heavenly Emperor, Huang Zuntian, Zhou Fan, and the others’ providence was increasing. Even the Divine Robe Daoist had an opportunity recently.
 Han Jue was very glad.
 Since his friends were fine, he could enter seclusion without worry.
 Now that the Ultimate God of Punishment and the Holy Mother of Order were his people, no one in the Chaos should be able to hurt the people close to him.
 In that case, his seclusion period had to increase.
 A hundred thousand years was too short!
 He would be around 15 million years old when the Chaotic Assembly took place. He still had nearly five million years.
 Han Ling returned to the Daoist temple several hours later.
 Seeing that her father was stretching, she immediately came over and said, “Father, I’ve already attained Freedom. I have a hundred thousand Emperor Soldiers.”
 A hundred thousand Freedom Emperor Soldiers?
 Han Jue’s heart beat wildly. The Primordial Emperor Star was a little terrifying.
 Could it be that there was a difference in Innate Great Creation? He felt that Jiang Jueshi was inferior to his daughter.
 Han Jue said, “It’s alright. Everyone below the Great Dao is an ant. Hurry up and attain the Great Dao. I’ll teach you a Mystical Power.”
 “Thank you, Father,” Han Ling replied, disappointment flashing across his eyes.
 Han Jue said helplessly, “Alright, you’re very strong, stronger than your brothers and sister. Alright? You just want me to praise you.”
 Han Lingling beamed and smiled. “Is it too much for a daughter to want her father’s praise?”
 Han Jue asked, “Does your mother know?”
 “I didn’t tell her. She doesn’t care about me, anyway.”
 Han Ling curled her lips. She could feel that her mother wanted a son more.
 Han Jue smiled and said, “Don’t blame your mother. If you want to blame someone, blame me. I should have turned you into a man.”
 “So what if I’m a woman? Gender doesn’t mean much. Cultivation is the key in this world. In any case, I don’t care about my body. I only care about my existence and my soul.” Han Ling spread his hands.


 Time passed quickly.
 Another hundred thousand years passed.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and habitually observed the Primordial World before checking his emails.
 Everything was fine. There was nothing to worry about.
 !!
 He began to think of the Mystical Destiny Book.
 The cooldown time of the Mystical Destiny Book was already up. This was a good thing. It was equivalent to the will of chaos and could tamper with the memories of all living beings. No, it was even more exaggerated and could change the truth!
 Han Jue checked the Mystical Destiny Book’s information again.
 [Mystical Destiny Book: Ultimate Supreme Treasure, a Supreme Treasure formed by seizing a supreme creation. It can tamper with the past and future of others and directly change everything. It is not restricted or spied on by any rules. Every time you use this treasure, your lifespan will be deducted at a different price. This treasure will sleep for a period of time. As the number of times it is used increases, its sleeping time will double. Special hint: This treasure cannot be upgraded and cannot recognize a master.]
 He pondered for a while and felt that there was no need to use it for the time being.
 He could use it if he encountered something in the future.
 Currently, he was not in any danger. The Ninth Chaos did not pursue the matter.
 He could let it go for the time being.
 After Han Jue made his decision, he looked at his daughter beside him.
 He said, “Ling’er, do you want to learn a Mystical Power?”
 Han Ling opened his eyes in surprise and immediately nodded.
 Han Jue immediately started to teach her the Mystical Power.
 Han Ling’s talent was indeed impressive. She could master ordinary Mystical Powers almost in one go. Several months later, Han Ling had already learned more than ten Mystical Powers from Han Jue, including the Divine Might Great Heaven Palm.
 Han Ling sighed. “I really want to find someone to spar with.”
 Han Jue immediately opened the authority of the simulation trial for her and introduced it briefly. She was very surprised.
 In the next few decades, Han Ling was immersed in the simulation trial and could not extricate herself.
 Han Jue came to the main Dao Field and observed the Heavenly Dao.
 Not all Sages had descendants in the Immortal World, let alone a family.
 Their teachings were more about master and disciple.
 To Sages, bloodline was not a safe way to inherit. It was not easy to produce an existence with unparalleled talent among the descendants. It was definitely easier to search the entire Immortal World for disciples.
 Currently, the Han family of the Immortal World had already been passed down for decades and even developed many branches that were distributed in dozens of mortal worlds.
 Han Jue was satisfied.
 Han Jue would not interfere with the Han family. They were only the candidates of his Creation Heaven’s Chosen.
 The Han family was a Sage family, after all. There were also many geniuses of the Heavenly Dao among the descendants. They also had a good reputation in the Immortal World.
 Just as Han Jue was thinking, a black vortex suddenly appeared in front of him.
 Invocation Technique!
 Han Jue deduced and discovered that it was Zhao Xuanyuan who used the Invocation Technique.
 Han Ling was still in the simulation trial. Han Jue immediately stepped into the black vortex.
 There was a trace of will in the Daoist temple. Thus, he was not afraid to die.
 After stepping through the black vortex, what greeted Han Jue’s vision were black Resentful Devils filling the sky. They were all in different postures and looked dense. There were countless of them.
 Below the black vortex were Dao Sovereign and the other three.
 Lao Dan raised his hands and used his Dharmic powers to cast a barrier, causing an invisible barrier to appear around the four of them.
 Zhao Xuanyuan heaved a sigh of relief when he saw Han Jue.
 “Master, save us!” Zhao Xuanyuan said anxiously.
 Han Jue’s back was facing the black vortex. He didn’t move in order to prevent a mysterious existence from using the black vortex to infiltrate the third Dao Field.
 His eyes narrowed. The Resentful Devils that filled the sky vanished.
 These Resentful Devils were all at the Freedom Realm. How could they stop the four Great Dao Sages?
 Han Jue found it strange.
 Before he could ask, he suddenly glanced in a direction.
 The ground below was like a barren desert. A figure was slowly walking over on Han Jue’s left.
 It was a man in broken armor. He was tall and straight, and his long hair fluttered in the wind. His ghost-like black face sported red eyebrows. His eyes were cold and, at first glance, he seemed to have four eyes.
 This person was as strong as a ferocious beast. Holding a huge saber in his right hand, the blade drew an endless ravine on the ground. This huge saber was even larger than him. The weapon was covered in black and red scales and the blade was silver like a bright moon.
 Han Jue narrowed his eyes.
 No wonder Dao Sovereign and the other three couldn’t stop him.
 Then again, where was this?
 Wait!
 The bottom of the Chaos!
 Han Jue had gone to the bottom of the Chaos when he fought with the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit. The bottom of the Chaos was also such a land.
 No!
 It’s not the bottom of the Chaos!
 There’s no Chaotic Qi here!
 “Master, be careful. The things here can devour Dharmic powers!” Zhao Xuanyuan said anxiously. He pointed at the terrifying figure dragging the saber and said, “It’s that fellow who injured Dao Sovereign and Jiang Yi. The two of them almost died with just one strike!”
 Jiang Yi coughed violently. “Save us some face…”
 Divine Might Heavenly Sage…
 Han Jue asked, “What is this place?”
 Zhao Xuanyuan replied, “I’m not sure. It shouldn’t be the Chaos. We entered from an entrance at the bottom of the Chaos. We grasped the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority here. After staying here for so long, we thought that we were already invincible in the Great Dao Sage Realm. I didn’t expect to encounter this fellow.”
 The Great Dao Providence Divine Authority was related to the Supreme Rules. To be able to control the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority outside the Chaos…
 Boom
 The armored man in the distance suddenly jumped, causing the ground within a hundred miles to collapse. Dust flew as he raised his scale saber and slashed at Han Jue.
 This power was enough to scare mortals to death, but it was nothing in his eyes.
 Han Jue frowned.
 The armored man broke through Lao Dan’s Dharmic powers barrier and knocked him to the ground. Han Jue raised his palm upon seeing that the saber was about to land on him.
 Divine Might Great Heaven Palm!
 A terrifying wave erupted and the armored man instantly turned into dust. The scale saber spun towards the horizon.
 That’s it?
 He was even inferior to a Sage!
 His aura was like a Great Dao Supreme, but his speed was far inferior to a Sage.
 Han Jue was puzzled when the scale saber suddenly stopped. With a cold flash, it attacked Han Jue again.
 So fast!
 Han Jue frowned even more. He didn’t dodge. The black vortex was behind him. Han Ling would definitely be in danger if this saber rushed in.
 Boom
 The scale saber was blocked by Han Jue’s Ultimate Mortal Robe. The two forces shook the entire sky and the huge wind caused the ground to shake.
 Under Han Jue’s gaze, the scales on the surface of the scale saber appeared and condensed into the armored man again.


 The armored man’s expression became sinister after recondensing his body. With a roar, he began to swing his saber crazily. Saber Qi swept out, carrying strange and profound runes. The runes expanded and flew in all directions.
 Dao Sovereign and the other three were pushed into the distance. The ground shattered.
 Zhao Xuanyuan looked at the armored man in horror and cursed in a low voice. “This fellow is so terrifying! He probably didn’t think much of us previously!”
 No one replied. Lao Dan’s expression was also ugly. Although Dao Sovereign and Jiang Yi were severely injured, the pain was nothing to them. They were only worried that Han Jue could not block it.
 The world kept collapsing. No matter how the armored man attacked, he could not break through the Ultimate Mortal Robe’s defense.
 Han Jue raised his right hand and raised thousands of hand shadows. It was dazzling. He pushed forward gently.
 Great Change Sealing Palm!
 Obsessed with attacking and did not dodge, the armored man was directly struck by the palm and could not move instantly.
 He hung in the air, staring at Han Jue.
 Dao Sovereign and the other three were stunned.
 They were all worried for Han Jue when they felt the armored man’s aura just now. They didn’t expect that the armored man wouldn’t be able to move after Han Jue’s casual move.
 Han Jue looked at them and asked, “Are you leaving or staying here?”
 Zhao Xuanyuan came back to his senses and hurriedly said, “Staying here. We’ve been here for more than 200,000 years and nothing happened. Today was just an accident. This fellow is too strong. Our Dharma treasures and Mystical Powers can’t do anything to him, but he can still summon Resentful Devils. We had no choice but to ask you for help.”
 Han Jue waved his sleeve and took the armored man and the scale saber away. Then, he stepped back into the black vortex.
 The vortex shrank and everything returned to normal.
 Lao Dan sighed. “Your master is indeed the strongest in the Chaos. That fellow’s aura has already surpassed the Great Dao Sage, but in front of him…”
 Zhao Xuanyuan said proudly, “Of course!” Dao Sovereign and Jiang Yi began to heal their injuries.
 Han Jue asked in his mind after returning to the third Dao Field, “Where was that place just now?”
 [1 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 So expensive! The value of a Dao Creator!
 Continue!
 [Consciousnessless Great Dao World: A world created by the Chaotic Deity, Chaotic Consciousness. It is suppressed by the Chaos and has no life. It is vast and endless.]
 Suppressed by the Chaos…
 Han Jue instantly thought of many things.
 No wonder the appearance rate of the Chaotic Consciousness was so high. Logically speaking, the Dao Creator had already jumped out of the Chaos and should not appear again, such as the other two Dao Creators whose names were unknown.
 It was not impossible!
 The Chaotic Consciousness had supported the rise of Azure Heaven Mystic in the Chaos. It was probably part of the plan.
 It seemed that unless it was absolutely necessary, he could not expose the Primordial World’s existence.
 The Ninth Chaos seemed to have no desires, but that was only on the surface.
 As for Dao Sovereign and the other three, Han Jue couldn’t be bothered. These guys liked to wander around and couldn’t stay idle. This was also good. They could unlock more new maps for him.
 Han Jue took out the scale saber. As for the armored man, he had already erased him. The armored man’s true form was this saber.
 This treasure was not simple. At the very least, it was a Chaotic Supreme Treasure. It was enough to make any Great Dao existence envious.
 He began to use Absolute Purification.
 Han Ling asked curiously after opening her eyes and seeing the saber, “Father, what is this?”
 “A Dharma treasure.”
 “I know that. What I want to know is…”
 “You want it?”
 Han Ling nodded in embarrassment.
 In the simulation trial, she discovered that many opponents had powerful Dharma treasures. Sometimes, Dharma treasures were stronger than Mystical Powers.
 Han Jue said, “This treasure is ferocious. I have to eliminate its hostility first. Wait for me to finish.”
 “Mm.”
 Han Ling responded, but her gaze was fixed on the scale saber.
 Han Jue recalled the Ultimate Dao Treasure he had snatched from the Carefree Immortal.
 He immediately took out this treasure. The half-moon red jade floated in his palm, attracting Han Ling’s gaze.
 “Choose one of the two. You can only choose one,” Han Jue said casually, not knowing which Dharma treasure was stronger.
 Han Ling pointed at the half-moon red jade. “I want this one. It’s stronger. The power it contains is very similar to my Great Creation.”
 Han Jue raised his eyebrows. This girl was only a Freedom Sage and could already spy on the Ultimate Dao Treasure?
 Han Jue threw the half-moon red jade to her.
 The Ultimate Dao Treasure was indeed impressive, but Han Jue had more than one. This treasure was not an offensive or defensive treasure. It was more inclined towards creation and karma.
 Han Ling took the treasure and immediately beamed. She began to study it.
 Several hundred years later.
 The scaled saber was successfully purified. The saber spirit in the saber no longer surged. It fell into a deep sleep and waited for its master to wake it up.

 This treasure was not simple. It contained Great Dao Supreme power and extremely strong killing intent. It could be left to disciples or descendants in the future.
 Han Jue thought of someone.
 Han Yu!
 This fellow was more obedient than Han Huang and Han Tuo. He followed the instructions obediently.
 It was time to support him.
 As Han Jue was thinking, a line of words suddenly appeared in front of him.
 (The Chaotic Consciousness sent you a dream. Do you accept?]
 Dao Creator!
 “Is it dangerous for me to accept this dream?”
 (1 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [No]
 Han Jue secretly heaved a sigh of relief and silently chose to accept it.
 The dream was a blank domain. Countless remains floated around it. It was ghastly and terrifying
 Han Jue looked around but did not find the Chaotic Consciousness. At this moment, a huge head suddenly turned around. Its eight eyes stared at him. Han Jue frowned and asked, “Who are you? Why are you visiting me in my dreams?”
 The Chaotic Consciousness smiled. “I am a Chaotic Deity.”
 Chaotic Deity!
 Han Jue was moved and pretended to be shocked.
 He muttered to himself, “Chaotic Deity… Could it be that the existence who created the Supreme Rules really exists…”
 The Chaotic Consciousness said, “I’m not the one who created the Chaos and the Supreme Rules, but the Ninth Chaos you saw before. I’m only responsible for protecting the Chaotic Order. The matter of the Nine-Headed Divine Spirit made the Ninth Chaos very dissatisfied with me.”
 Han Jue remained silent.
 He didn’t know what the Chaotic Consciousness wanted to tell him.
 After all, the Chaotic Consciousness still had a one-star favorability towards him.
 “You went to the Consciousnessless Great Dao World when you went to save your disciples. This world was created by an existence that surpassed the Great Dao Supreme Realm. It’s equivalent to a second Chaos. However, he was suppressed by the Ninth Chaos as soon as he created this world. The Consciousnessless Great Dao World was suppressed by the Chaos. All the Spirit Qi in the world was sucked away by the Chaos and the Consciousnessless Great Dao World became a place of nothingness.”
