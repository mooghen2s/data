 After returning to the Daoist temple, Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief.
 No one could save Pan Xin now!
 Han Jue faced Pan Xin’s gaze and said calmly, “If you want to blame someone, blame what you said just now. Your choice makes me uneasy.”
 Pan Xin gritted his teeth. “Who are you?!”
 At this moment, Han Jue’s image in his mind became mysterious. More than two hundred thousand years ago, when he first met Han Jue, this child was only an ant.
 Now that he was at the Freedom Sage Realm, Han Jue easily suppressed him. What did this mean?
 This meant that Han Jue was at least a Great Dao Sage!
  In just two hundred thousand years, it was impossible for a mortal to cultivate to the Great Dao Sage Realm!
 There was only one possibility. Han Jue was a mighty figure himself!
 Pan Xin knew that the Great Dao Sages liked to use their clones or Dharma Idols to reincarnate and set up traps in various corners of the Chaos.
 Han Jue was definitely one of them.
 Facing Pan Xin’s question, Han Jue smiled and sealed his mouth.
 Then, he closed his eyes and began another bout of seclusion.
 In the depths of the chaos, in the Great Dao Tower.
 After tens of thousands of years of development, the Great Dao Tower had already formed. All kinds of floating islands and buildings that were like stars gathered in a radius of billions of kilometers.
 In the palace on the first floor of the Great Dao Tower.
 Zhou Fan and the Evil Heavenly Emperor gathered in the hall. There was no third person.
 Zhou Fan asked, “Where’s Han Tuo?”
 He still cared a lot about this junior.
 Han Tuo was Han Jue’s son, so he was naturally his junior.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor said, “He’s trying to attain the Dao.”
 Zhou Fan smiled in satisfaction. “Not bad. If my master knows, he’ll be very happy.”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor smiled.
 Zhou Fan sized him up and said meaningfully, “Your Majesty, I suddenly can’t see through you. Who are you working for now?”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor placed his hands behind his waist. His imperial robe fluttered as he chuckled. “I’m not with anyone. I’m just fighting for my life.”
 “Fighting for your life…”
 Zhou Fan was deep in thought.
 They had already transcended the Heavenly Dao and could freely travel through the chaos. They could travel through the past and future and look down on all living beings.
 Such a realm was something they had never imagined. But even so, they were still trapped.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor smiled. “Alright, let’s not talk about meaningless things. I came to you today to plan for a mysterious domain formed by the corpse of an ancient Chaotic Fiendcelestial. There are great opportunities hidden inside. If my Heavenly Court eats alone, the losses will definitely be heavy. I’ll give you a portion of the benefits. You should have already seen my sincerity from our previous cooperation. Do you want to take action?”
 Zhou Fan asked, “That mysterious mighty figure also wants to attack?”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor nodded. “Without him, I wouldn’t dare.”
 “Alright, the Great Dao Tower is also participating!”
 Zhou Fan agreed readily. He wasn’t confident in the Evil Heavenly Emperor, but in the mysterious mighty figure.
 He asked curiously, “Who is that mighty figure? Is he related to the Inauspicious Evil?”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor said with a faint smile, “Don’t ask about some things. You’re only a Primordial Chaos Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal.”
 If anyone else said this, Zhou Fan would definitely feel humiliated. However, from the Evil Heavenly Emperor’s words, Zhou Fan could hear his concern. If he continued asking, he might very well violate the taboo.
 He was no longer an ignorant mortal in the Immortal World. Now, he had a certain understanding of the Chaos.
 In the endless chaos, there were indeed many taboos that could not be probed or even spoken!
 Even a Great Dao Sage wouldn’t violate these taboos.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor turned into golden smoke and dissipated, leaving only a sentence: “Three thousand years later, bring people to the Waning Moon Star Field. I will lead ten million Heavenly Troops to wait for you.”
 Zhou Fan narrowed his eyes. He was shocked by the speed of development.
 These people were sent as fodder. It was not the full strength of the Heavenly Court!
 Five thousand years passed in the blink of an eye.
 Han Jue opened his eyes. Pan Xin had yet to be enslaved, but he had already lost consciousness and was sitting quietly in the invisible Primordial Heavenly Prison.
 As expected of an existence at the perfected Freedom Primordial Chaos Realm!
 Wouldn’t it take millions of years or even longer to enslave the Chaotic Deities?
 Han Jue had this thought and even started to worry.
 He believed that as long as he played it safe and was careful, he would be on par with the Chaotic Deities or even surpass them.
 Even without the system, he could continue to grow with everything he had.
 Of course, he was still grateful to the system.
 Without the system, he would still be floating in the cycle of reincarnation. How could he pursue the Dao and live forever?
 Han Jue looked outside the Daoist temple.
 Dao Sovereign, Zhao Xuanyuan, and Jiang Yi were waiting at the door.
 After training outside, Dao Sovereign returned to cultivate diligently. Zhao Xuanyuan and Jiang Yi were the closest to him. After all, they were both prodigies.
 Han Jue’s voice floated out, “What is it?”
 The three of them had been kneeling for several years. Unable to wait any longer, Jiang Yi was the first to speak. “Master, the three of us want to go to the Chaos to train.”
 However, they suppressed their cultivation levels.
 It was probably related to Dao Sovereign.
 Dao Sovereign said, “Recently, there has been some information from the Chaos Heavenly Road. At the end of the Chaos Heavenly Road is the world of paragons. It’s even larger than the Immortal World. There are countless planes and secret realms hidden around it. There are countless opportunities. The three of us want to try.”
 Han Jue said, “The Chaos is very dangerous. If anything happens, I won’t save you. Think carefully.”
 Zhao Xuanyuan chuckled. “Master, don’t worry. What happened before the previous calamity won’t happen. We will definitely be careful. Even if something happens, the three of us have already left our split souls in our respective Daoist temples. At most, we will cultivate again.”
 It wasn’t rare for Zenith Heaven Golden Immortals to have such methods.
 Han Jue sent them out.
 Since they had left a way out, it was good to go out and explore. Han Jue still didn’t know much about the Chaos. It was also a good thing to send disciples to gain information.
 The future Heavenly Dao was definitely not safe. The Great Chaotic Era had already begun.
 After sending the three of them off, Han Jue looked at the emails and continued cultivating
 Another three thousand years passed.
 [Primordial Heavenly Prison has successfully enslaved the target.]
 [Pan Xin has a favorable impression of you. Current favorability: Max.]
  It took him eight thousand years to successfully enslave this fellow!
 Han Jue immediately checked Pan Xin’s attributes panel.
 [Pan Xin: Perfected of the Freedom Primordial Chaos Realm, Pangu’s descendant, one of the first living beings after creation. He has experienced the Immeasurable Calamity and roams the mortal world. Afraid of being discovered by the ancient Master of Calamity, he especially infiltrated the Sword Dao River. Because of your nature, he is interested in you. Current favorability: Max.]
 Perfected Freedom Primordial Chaos Realm!
 However, the Great Dao Door required one to work hard. Others couldn’t help, at least not now. At most, he could talk about his Dao Validation experience.
 At this moment…
 (Pangu has developed hatred towards you. Current Hatred Points: 1 star]


 Pangu…
 This fellow was indeed not dead!
 Han Jue immediately became nervous. He immediately checked his interpersonal relationships and found Pangu.
 Pangu’s portrait was extremely domineering. He was roaring at the sky with a sinister expression. His eyes were filled with deterrence. His black hair was disheveled and looked very ancient.
 [Pangu: Cultivation unknown. Chaotic Fiendcelestial, Creator of the Heavenly Dao, ancestor of all things, Fiendcelestial Slayer. Because you severed the will control he left in Pan Xin, he has developed displeasure towards you. Current Hatred Points: 1 star]
 So much Connate providence!
  Han Jue frowned. Pangu’s cultivation level was unknown, so he was definitely stronger than him. As for how strong, he couldn’t say for the time being.
 In any case, he was no match for Pangu now.
 He was still too rash.
 At this moment, Pan Xin slowly opened his eyes. Seeing him, he immediately knelt down.
 Han Jue asked, “Have you seen Pangu?” Pan Xin looked up and said in surprise, “Giant God Pangu has long died. How can I have seen him? Even in his inheritance, I can only see his figure and not his true body.”
 Han Jue was deep in thought.
 Where was Pangu?
 He used the derivation function to deduce.
 (1 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 A notification appeared in front of him.
 (Can’t deduce Pangu’s exact location. He’s not ‘alive’ at the moment.]
 Han Jue continued to ask in his mind, “Can Pangu threaten me now?”
 [No]
 This time, his lifespan was not deducted.
 Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief.
 It seemed that Pangu was really dead, but his will existed in a form that even the Great Dao Sages could not understand.
 No matter what, it was fine as long as Pangu could not threaten Han Jue for the time being.
 Han Jue looked at Pan Xin again.
 Pan Xin knelt very respectfully, like a servant.
 Han Jue asked, “Who’s the elder brother and younger brother now?”
 Pan Xin was stunned for a moment before smiling bitterly. “You’re my elder brother and I’m your younger brother. You can call me whatever you want.”
 Han Jue was secretly pleased. Who asked you to posture in front of me?
 He didn’t make things difficult for him. That would only lower his status. No matter what, Pan Xin was a Freedom Sage, after all. He should give him face.
 “Don’t reveal our relationship when you return. Continue what you did before, but don’t help the Great Dao Divine Spirit. In the future, focus on the Heavenly Dao. Don’t think of a way to extradite any existence in the Chaos into the Heavenly Dao, understand?” Han Jue instructed.
 Pan Xin nodded in agreement.
 Then, Han Jue reminded him again before waving his hand and sending him to the 33rd Heaven.
 Pan Xin arrived in front of his Pangu Hall. Emperor Xiao and Jin Shen appeared.
 The two Sages heaved a sigh of relief when they saw him.
 The Sages had seen Pan Xin inviting Han Jue inside, but after that, their auras disappeared. It was extremely strange.
 Emperor Xiao and Jin Shen both knew of Han Jue’s terrifying achievements. Their fear was deeply rooted, causing them to lose confidence in Pan Xin.
 Now that Pan Xin had returned, the nervousness in the hearts of the two Sages instantly vanished.
 “Why did you take so long to return?” Jin Shen asked.
 Pan Xin said expressionlessly, “A mere eight thousand years is considered long? I only discussed the Dao with Fellow Daoist Han.”
 He entered Pangu Hall.
 The two Sages followed closely behind.
 On the other side.
 In the Universal Hall.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du was deep in thought when he saw that scene.
 He felt that something was wrong. Pan Xin had changed!
 He shook his head.
 Pan Xin was a Freedom Sage. Even a group of Great Dao Sages in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End couldn’t do anything to him. What right did Han Jue have to threaten him?
 In Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du’s opinion, it was almost impossible to force Pan Xin to submit.
 He couldn’t understand his growth speed.
 He decided to observe Pan Xin later.
 In the Daoist temple, Han Jue opened the emails after observing the Immortal World.
 He wondered if anything major had happened in his circle of friends over the years.
 (Your good friend Divine Lord Peacock was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure and fell into the endless crack of the universe.)
 (Your son Han Tuo was attacked by the descendants of the Fiendcelestial] x2703827
 (Your good friend Evil Heavenly Emperor was attacked by an Ancient Chaotic Fiendcelestial and was severely injured.)
 [Your good friend Empress Houtu created a world. The power of reincarnation transformed into all things.]
 [Your disciple Dao Sovereign has entered the mysterious mystic realm.]
 (Your disciple Zhao Xuanyuan has entered the mysterious mystic realm.]
 (Your good friend Jiang Yi has entered the mysterious mystic realm.]
 [Your disciple Dao Sovereign was attacked by a mysterious existence and was severely injured.)
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor was fighting again!
 Just by reading the emails, he could feel the cruelty of that war, but Han Jue was not worried.
 He believed that the Evil Heavenly Emperor would have the last laugh.
 He continued to look down. As expected, the three brothers led by Dao Sovereign who had gone out earlier began to be beaten up.
 Apart from these two groups of people, the other friends were all cultivating or seeking opportunities. It was considered calm.
 After reading the emails, Han Jue looked at Xing Hongxuan. The fetus was still in gestation, and it was still impossible to predict when he would be born.
 He had no choice but to use the derivation function.
 “I want to know when my youngest son will be born?”
 (50 million years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 Wait.
 Could it be that Primordial Origin’s failure was also because of him?
 Han Jue frowned. At this rate, his youngest son would stay in his mother’s womb forever?
 What was the difference between this and being sealed?
 This was troublesome.
 (10 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 Ten times the value of the Dao Creator…
 Han Jue’s heart twitched.
 (Destroy the current Chaos and create a higher level Chaos.]
 Han Jue frowned.
  He suddenly recalled the previous deduction of the future. Qin Ling had roared that he wanted to destroy the Chaos and open up the Primordial World. Could it be his arrangement?
 It was very likely!
 The terrifying giant shadow behind the Heavenly Dao Army should be Han Jue himself!
 I see…
 He didn’t want to advance the process of the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity, but in that case, his youngest son would still have to stay in Xing Hongxuan’s womb for at least 23 billion years. Not to mention his youngest son’s feelings, Xing Hongxuan probably wouldn’t be able to stand it either.
 Was there no other way?


 Han Jue frowned as his thoughts ran wild.
 His idea just now was indeed a way to make his youngest son temporarily lose the Primordial Fiendcelestial’s bloodline. He should be able to be born.
 In that case, it was as if he, the father, was suppressing his son’s potential.
 Why couldn’t he give up the Primordial Fiendcelestial bloodline?
 This thought flashed through Han Jue’s mind and was quickly abandoned.
 No way!
 His son was a Primordial Fiendcelestial and had to grow for countless years.
  He was the Primordial Fiendcelestial now and could protect everyone around him.
 Han Jue wasn’t stupid and wouldn’t cause trouble for himself.
 Was there any bloodline higher than the Primordial Fiendcelestial?
 Han Jue immediately asked in his mind, “If my bloodline surpasses the Primordial Fiendcelestial, can my son be born?”
 (10 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 (Yes, the Chaos only rejects the Primordial Chaos, but there is no bloodline stronger than the Primordial Fiendcelestial at the moment. At least, the system has not encountered any karma of that level.]
 This line of words contained a lot of information.
 Could it be that the system had encountered the Primordial Fiendcelestial before?
 Han Jue couldn’t imagine it.
 He didn’t ask anymore. If he continued asking, he wouldn’t be able to stop. 10 quadrillion years was nothing to him, but it couldn’t withstand the consumption of asking 100,000 questions.
 Han Jue looked at Xing Hongxuan again.
 He would make a decision when she couldn’t stand her current state and looked for him.
 Currently, the existence of her youngest son could still help Xing Hongxuan cultivate. It was a good thing.
 Han Jue thought silently.
 He suddenly thought of a possibility.
 If he removed his youngest son’s bloodline, causing him to be born amidst the expectations of countless people but ultimately disappointed them with inferior talent, wouldn’t he fall from grace as the strongest genius of the Hidden Sect? Wasn’t this a f*cking fantasy novel?
 Han Jue was actually looking forward to it.
 Cough cough!
 It was better to wait and see. If possible, he wouldn’t do that. Otherwise, the child would suffer a lot.
 Han Jue shook his head and laughed. Then, he slowly closed his eyes.
 …
 At the edge of the Immortal World, a golden path extended from the top of a peak into the depths of the Dark Forbidden Zone.
 After training in the Chaos, when they returned to the Heavenly Dao, the cultivators felt like they had returned to their hometown, so they became enthusiastic.
 It had to be said that Pan Xin had indeed contributed greatly. The appearance of the Chaotic Heavenly Road had indeed played the role of uniting the cultivators with higher cultivation levels in the Heavenly Dao.
 Pan Xin suddenly landed on the golden light path. Behind him was Jin Shen. The two Sages retracted their Sage aura and suppressed their cultivation to the Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm before walking forward.
 “On this trip to the Chaos, I’ll also check the Chaotic Heavenly Road. You should be more serious and see if anything is lacking,” Pan Xin instructed in a low voice.
 Jin Shen nodded.
 He had a strange expression.
 In the past, Pan Xin did not care if the Chaotic Heavenly Road was perfected. He only wanted to fight for power.
 Could it be that the Immeasurable Merit Divine Might Heavenly Sage had enlightened him?
 For a time, Han Jue’s image in Jin Shen’s heart suddenly improved.
 In his opinion, Han Jue was the true perfect Dao Pursuer. He was indifferent to fame and fortune and cultivated in seclusion every day. However, when the Heavenly Dao was in trouble, he never avoided it. He always stood up and turned the tide.
 Of course, worship was worship. Jin Shen had no intention of joining the Hidden Sect.
 The Hidden Sect was already powerful enough. Even if he joined, it would be very difficult for him to gain Han Jue’s trust. Pan Xin was different. There were too few people around him. He was his right-hand man.
 The two Sages strolled forward, but each step covered ten thousand miles.
 Soon, they entered the Dark Forbidden Zone. Looking back, they could no longer see the Immortal World.
 The golden path was surrounded by darkness. It was extremely dark, with no light in sight. It was extremely oppressive.
 “That’s right. Dao Sovereign, can you be more cautious in the future?”
 “Nonsense, it’s all because of the two of you. The moment you entered, you wandered around like ferocious dogs and triggered the restriction.”
 It was Dao Sovereign, Zhao Xuanyuan, and Jiang Yi.
 Their auras were a little weak. It was obvious that they had just experienced a fierce battle.
 Pan Xin and Jin Shen recognized the three of them. After all, the Sages paid attention to the Hidden Sect. Dao Sovereign and the other two were the faces of the Hidden Sect disciples. They were famous before entering the Hidden Sect.
 Dao Sovereign and the other two could not see the Sages’ true appearances. They could only see the fog on their faces, so they did not stop and brushed past them.
 In the Chaotic Heavenly Road, they often encountered mighty figures who hid their true appearance, so Dao Sovereign and the other two were not surprised.
 Pan Xin said casually, “Fellow Daoist Han indeed has good taste. The Heavenly Dao is lucky to have him.”
 Jin Shen understood what he meant and asked cautiously, “You and Fellow Daoist Han…”
 “Nothing. After the Dao discussion, my understanding of him has deepened. Fellow Daoist Han will not be our enemy. He will only be our helper,” Pan Xin said ambiguously.
 Irel
 Jin Shen’s eyes lit up. Could it be that Pan Xin and Han Jue had already established a friendly relationship or even an alliance?
 If that was the case, it would be easier for them to survive in the Heavenly Dao in the future. They wouldn’t be stopped by other Sages.
 The more Jin Shen thought about it, the more he felt that his future was bright.
 At this moment… Pan Xin suddenly turned around, startling him.
 Following the two Sages’ gaze was only darkness. They couldn’t see anything. “What’s wrong?” Jin Shen asked.
 Pan Xin said expressionlessly, “Something is staring at us.”
 Jin Shen asked, “Inauspicious Evil?”
 Pan Xin shook his head.
 Jin Shen was surprised. Wasn’t the invisible evil existence in the Dark Forbidden Zone the Inauspicious Evil?
 Pan Xin said, “Let’s continue walking and see how long this thing will follow me.”
  They maintained their previous pace and continued forward.
 In the blood-colored starry sky, countless limbs floated in the void.
 A dilapidated pavilion floated among countless meteors. Covered in blood, Han Tuo lay on the roof, panting heavily and looking dispirited.
 Yi Tian suddenly landed and sat beside him. He panted and asked, “Brat, are you done?”
 Han Tuo rolled his eyes at him. “Aren’t you the same? Why are you faking it?”
 Yi Tian looked into the distance. Two terrifying huge shadows were fighting in the depths of the void. Boundless fog surged violently, filled with pressure. It was as if this blood-colored starry sky could shatter at any time.
 Fear appeared in Yi Tian’s eyes.
 The difference was too great. He didn’t even dare to approach the main battlefield.


 Yi Tian turned to look at Han Tuo and asked, “Do you think we can return alive this time?”
 Unlike in the past, they were not suppressed. Instead, they had been fighting non-stop. After thousands of years of battle, even Yi Tian, who was as strong as a Pseudo-Sage, was about to collapse.
 He had never experienced such a long battle. Furthermore, he had to use his full strength every day, or he would die here.
 Boom
 The space beside the dilapidated pavilion suddenly shattered. A huge mouth flew out. It was extremely huge as if it could devour a planet in one bite. In front of it, Yi Tian and Han Tuo were like dust. They were so frightened that they immediately dodged.
 Han Tuo held his divine spear and glared at it. This was a Chaotic Beast. It had a head like a whale and a body like a snake lizard. It had no eyes and dozens of sharp mountain-like teeth in its bloody mouth. The bloody aura it spat out was visible to the naked eye.
 Above the head of this Chaotic Beast stood a figure in black and sinister heavy armor. He wore a helmet, so his true appearance could not be seen.
  He held a long sword burning with black flames and slashed at Han Tuo and Yi Tian.
 This sword slashed out countless ghosts and vengeful spirits. It was like a black torrent that drowned out everything. It was unstoppable.
 Han Tuo raised his spear and stabbed. The spear was like a dragon, tearing through the black torrent.
 Yi Tian roared angrily. His figure quickly rose and transformed into a ten thousand feet tall body. He punched out like another chaotic ferocious beast, his violent aura shaking the void.
 Han Tuo and Yi Tian, who had just caught their breaths, fell into a bitter battle again.
 This was only a reflection of the battlefield. The other Heavenly Troops were also suffering.
 In the depths of the void.
 Zhou Fan held the Great Dao Tower and kept casting. The Great Dao Tower spun at high speed in his palm. Countless wondrous techniques appeared. Golden lotuses scattered forward. The golden rain was like arrows and the lightning was like blades.
 Following his gaze, a terrifying figure of unknown height could be seen. His body was surrounded by a vast fog that covered most of his body.
 The wonders of the Great Dao Tower landed on him, but they did not cause him any damage.
 “This is a Chaotic Fiendcelestial? Its corpse alone is so powerful…” Zhou Fan muttered to himself, his eyes filled with fear.
 The Heavenly Court and the Great Dao Tower had been fighting here for thousands of years and had suffered heavy losses.
 Most importantly, they couldn’t retreat at all.
 The blood-colored starry sky was a special array formation that sealed the void. One could only enter and not leave.
 The Inauspicious Divine Emperor!
 In the thousands of years of fighting, Zhou Fan learned the identity of the Inauspicious Divine Emperor from the Evil Heavenly Emperor.
 The ruler of the Inauspicious Evil!
 Even so, the Inauspicious Divine Emperor couldn’t easily defeat the Chaotic Fiendcelestial.
 A huge black hand suddenly descended from above and grabbed him.
 Zhou Fan struggled crazily.
 On the other side of the battlefield, the Evil Heavenly Emperor was surrounded by countless black-armored figures. It was extremely difficult.
 “Why can’t we kill all these Fiendcelestial Soldiers?”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor frowned, his heart filled with anxiety.
 He had underestimated this Chaotic Fiendcelestial.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor’s eyes flickered. He was in a dilemma.
 Two thousand years passed.
 The Book of Misfortune was finally upgraded successfully. It had been fusing for ten thousand years. It was really not easy.
 (Book of Misfortune has been upgraded successfully. It has been upgraded from a Freedom Supreme Treasure to a Great Dao Numinous Treasure.]
 Seeing this line of words, Han Jue immediately took out the Book of Misfortune from the Primordial World.
 It wasn’t easy for it to level up successfully. Should he kill an enemy to liven things up?
 At the Great Dao Realm and with a Dharma treasure of the Great Dao level he could at least curse a Great Dao Sage to death!
 Han Jue thought for a moment and dismissed the thought.
 There was no need.
 In any case, his enemies had given up on plotting against the Heavenly Dao recently. Why should he break the peace?
 Moreover, he had previously made up his mind not to change the process of the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity.
 Han Jue put away the Book of Misfortune and was about to continue cultivating.
 Han Jue immediately headed to the Universal Hall.
 Only Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du was in the hall. He was meditating with a frown and a dark expression.
 Han Jue came in front of him and asked, “What is it?”
 There were no powerful enemies near the Heavenly Dao.
 The Immortal World was also peaceful.
 Han Jue couldn’t help but look at the Heavenly Dao.
 In the eyes of a Great Dao Sage, the Heavenly Dao was a ball of Qi. It wrapped around the yellow Qi of the Immortal World and the myriad worlds, protecting the interior of the Heavenly Dao.
 Eh?
 Han Jue narrowed his eyes. He suddenly saw threads of light appear in the Heavenly Dao and shoot into the myriad worlds. Most of them landed in the Immortal World.
 What are those?
 Han Jue secretly deduced, but he couldn’t figure out the origin of those lights.
 At this moment, lines of words suddenly appeared in front of him.
 (Detected that Pangu’s will is controlling the Heavenly Dao. A large number of his descendants will be born. You have the following choices:]
 [2: Don’t stop it for the time being. This matter can increase the providence of the Heavenly Dao. Watch the development of the Heavenly Dao and you can obtain a Great Dao Fragment and a Creation Spirit Stone.)
 Han Jue frowned.
 He didn’t expect that just after he subdued Pan Xin, Pangu would create a large number of them. What a good move.
 After all, Pangu was only a little unhappy with him now. Moreover, this matter could increase the providence of the Heavenly Dao, so why not?
 More importantly, he would have another Creation Spirit Stone, which was another Chaotic Fiendcelestial!
 Han Jue immediately chose the second option.
 (You choose not to stop it for the time being and watch the development of the Heavenly Dao. You will obtain a Great Dao Fragment and a Creation Spirit Stone.]
  Han Jue said, “Since I can’t see through it, let’s wait and see. The Heavenly Dao can’t destroy itself, right?”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du felt that it made sense and nodded.
 Seeing that everything was fine, Han Jue wanted to leave.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du suddenly asked, “Fellow Daoist Han, Pan Xin has changed recently. He even specially set off to perfect the Chaotic Heavenly Road. What do you think?”
 Han Jue turned around and glanced at him. “Isn’t this a good thing?”
 For some reason, facing Han Jue’s gaze, Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du inexplicably panicked. This was a feeling he had never felt when facing him in the past.
 He inexplicably thought of his teacher, Laozi. When he faced Laozi, he also uncontrollably panicked.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “It’s indeed a good thing, but I’m worried. After all, Pan Xin often goes to the Chaos. But I’m relieved if it’s Fellow Daoist Han’s arrangement.”


 Han Jue stared at him and asked with a faint smile, “Then, does Fellow Daoist Xuan Du want me to arrange it?”
 How could he not understand the meaning behind Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du’s words?
 If it was in the past, he would definitely be afraid, but he was already a Great Dao Sage. He might even be Laozi’s match.
 Moreover, as long as he didn’t see the Primordial Heavenly Prison with his own eyes, Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du would at most think that Han Jue knew some kind of coercion method.
 As their eyes met, Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du suddenly felt a chill down his spine.
 Crap.
 He had been too rash.
  Although he was on good terms with Han Jue and chatted happily, it was only on the surface.
 Once Han Jue felt danger, this fellow would definitely kill him!
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du hurriedly said, “I was just asking. If I offended you, Fellow Daoist Han, please don’t mind me.”
 Han Jue smiled. “Fellow Daoist Xuan Du, don’t be nervous. After all, you and I both want the Heavenly Dao’s betterment, right?”
 Han Jue disappeared from the hall.
 After Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du confirmed that Han Jue had left, he heaved a sigh of relief.
 He was filled with fear. He had indeed been reckless just now.
 “I should continue to maintain my previous attitude. As long as Han Jue can help the Heavenly Dao, why should I investigate his secrets?”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du was relieved after thinking it through.
 He felt that there was something wrong with his Dao heart and his selfish desires were swelling. This was not a good thing.
 He began to meditate and recite scriptures to refine his Dao heart.
 “The Dao that can be told is not the eternal Dao…”
 After returning to the Daoist temple, Han Jue took out the Creation Spirit Stone and began to choose the Fiendcelestial Qi.
 After thinking about it, he decided to create the Flesh Fiendcelestial.
 Yes, if he was nurtured as a tank, he would definitely be the vanguard of the Fiendcelestial Army in the future. He wouldn’t be useless.
 After the Creation Spirit Stone fused with the Fiendcelestial Qi of the Flesh Fiendcelestial, Han Jue went to the second Dao Field and released the Traversal Fiendcelestial and the Fog Fiendcelestial.
 The two Fiendcelestials transformed into human forms. They looked sinister and terrifying, but they were actually still children.
 Han Jue asked Murong Qi to receive them.
 same.
 The current second Dao Field already had the Sage Great Loose Heaven, four Pseudo-Sages, and three Zenith Heaven Golden Immortals.
 Pseudo-Sages were Murong Qi, the crimson fox, the Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial, and Guan Bubai.
 Zenith Heaven Golden Immortals were the Time Fiendcelestial, the Traversal Fiendcelestial, and the Fog Fiendcelestial.
 There was also the Dao Field guard, Dong Zhuo, who had transformed from Sage Li Muyi!
 Putting aside the Dao Field guards, the current second Dao Field was actually stronger than the main Dao Field. The main Dao Field only had many disciples, few Pseudo-Sages, and even fewer Sages.
 Han Jue was quite satisfied. He had to hide his strongest strength in the dark and only kill the enemy when necessary.
 The arrival of the Traversal Fiendcelestial and the Fog Fiendcelestial made the second Dao Field lively. The other Fiendcelestials who were cultivating rushed over.
 Han Jue returned to the main Dao Field and continued cultivating.
 In order to subdue Pan Xin, he had not been in seclusion for five thousand years. He wasn’t used to it.
 Hurry up and do a five-thousand-year process!
 Stabilize the Dao Heart!
 973 years later.
 A line of words suddenly appeared in front of Han Jue, who was meditating.
 [The Evil Heavenly Emperor sent you a dream. Do you accept?]
 Han Jue opened his eyes and frowned, very unhappy.
 You interrupted my cultivation again!
 However, the other party was the Evil Heavenly Emperor, so Han Jue couldn’t flare
  up.
 If it were anyone else, Han Jue would directly take out the Book of Misfortune and teach them a lesson.
 (The Evil Heavenly Emperor sent you a dream. Do you accept?]
 (The Evil Heavenly Emperor sent you a dream. Do you accept?]
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor began to spam.
 Han Jue chose to accept it.
 It was just a dream. There was no danger.
 Even if there was danger, Han Jue had a way to escape. After all, he was already a Great Dao Sage.
 In the dream was a blood-colored starry sky. Figures could be seen fighting everywhere. There was no lack of ferocious beasts as huge as Buzhou Divine Mountain. Their auras were terrifying Han Jue saw the Heavenly Troops, but most of them had already turned into corpses.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor appeared in front of him with a solemn expression and said in a low voice, “This is my current situation. I’m afraid I’ve failed in this battle. If you have anything to say to your son, I’ll tell him for you. I’ll also apologize for not taking good care of him.”
 Han Jue frowned. “Is there no way to escape?”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor shook his head. “I can’t escape. My body has already been killed. It’s only because my soul is in a special array formation that I have the chance to visit you in your dreams and settle the aftermath.”
 Han Jue remained silent.
 He suspected that the Evil Heavenly Emperor was asking him to attack!
 Unless the Evil Heavenly Emperor was also a Great Dao Sage, or if there was a Great Dao Sage who guided him like this.
 Han Jue silently recorded everything around him and said, “Tell Han Tuo that everything is fate. Even if he dies, he shouldn’t die in
 vain.”
 With that, he removed the dream.
 After his consciousness returned to reality, Han Jue asked in his mind, “Who instigated the Evil Heavenly Emperor to visit me in my dreams?”
 He had calculated it himself and could not deduce it. He could only rely on the system.
 All along, Han Jue was already used to guessing everything with conspiracy theories to prevent any accidents.
 (200 billion years of lifespan will be consumed. Do you want to continue?]
 Indeed!
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor was not worth this price!
 A line of words appeared in front of him.
 [Great Dao Concealment Fiendcelestial: Perfected Great Dao Primordial Chaos Realm, Transcendent Dao Expert, Chaotic Fiendcelestial]
 It was him!
 Han Jue remembered that when he went to the depths of the Chaos to find the Great Dao of Extreme Origin, he had seen the Great Dao Concealment Fiendcelestial. Not only that, but the Great Dao Concealment Fiendcelestial was also among the Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols he grasped.
 So he was the Evil Heavenly Emperor’s backing.
 No wonder the Evil Heavenly Emperor rose so quickly.
 Han Jue frowned and fell into deep thought.
 The other party had instigated the Evil Heavenly Emperor to visit him in his dreams. He definitely wanted him to take action. He couldn’t go to the Chaos.
 However, facing a Transcendent Dao Expert, there was no point in hiding his cultivation. All the Great Dao Sages knew that Han Jue had already attained the Great Dao.
 In that case, he would attack!
 It was only right to save his son, but Han Jue wouldn’t go personally.
 He moved to the 33rd Heaven and looked at the Dark Forbidden Zone. He began to search for the environment in the dream.
 His Sage Sense swept through the Dark Forbidden Zone and spread into the depths of the Chaos.
 Great Dao Sages could see the Chaos with a thought!
  As Han Jue searched, he pinched his fingers to deduce Han Tuo’s aura.
 The two of them had bloodline karma, so it was easy to find.
 At this moment, Sages appeared around Han Jue, thinking that something was wrong.
 However, Han Jue ignored them and focused on searching
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du also came. All the Sages looked at him. He had no choice but to bite the bullet and ask, “Fellow Daoist Han, what are you looking at?”
 Han Jue ignored him, making him a little embarrassed.
 The Sages became even more nervous. Could it be that a powerful enemy was attacking?
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du also thought of this. The awkwardness was instantly replaced by worry. An existence that could alarm Han Jue was definitely very strong and was not something they could deal with.
