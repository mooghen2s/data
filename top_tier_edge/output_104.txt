The mighty figures of the Chaos and Primordial Chaos trembled in fear and anger at Primordial Despair’s power and the Dark Forbidden Lord’s arrogance.
Primordial Despair was naturally not so powerful. He only obtained a trace of Han Jue’s power.
“We have no way out. Put down our fear and fight to the death!”
The Ultimate God of Punishment’s voice sounded. He had greater influence than Han Huang and Zhao Shuangquan. After all, he was the highest existence in the Chaos, the leader of the gods.
Great Dao Divine Spirits and Divine Punishers began to mobilize their divine power. The three thousand Great Dao and the Seven Supreme Rules trembled. Countless powers poured down and landed on all the Great Dao Sages present.
Han Jue watched with relish and was not in a hurry to attack.
Clearly, the Ninth Chaos was supporting them from behind the scenes. Otherwise, even a Great Dao Divine Spirit would find it difficult to borrow such a strong power of rules.
The Ultimate God of Punishment even summoned fifty thousand Divine Authority Generals. The Chaotic Consciousness’ clone summoned a hundred thousand Destruction Authority Generals. More and more figures surrounded Primordial Despair.
Swish!
The sound of air being torn apart sounded. A red arrow was shot at Han Jue. It was so fast that even Primordial Despair didn’t have time to react. Unfortunately, just as it was about to touch Han Jue, it dissipated and didn’t cause any damage.
“What?”
Han Ye was moved. He had used his full strength, and it was an unexpected arrow.
Dao Sovereign, Zhao Xuanyuan, and Jiang Yi appeared behind Su Qi. Zhao Xuanyuan reached out to grab him, while Dao Sovereign and Jiang Yi used the power of the Great Dao World to attack Han Jue.
The two Great Dao Worlds shrank in their
palms and shot out with their palms. Like
Han Ye’s arrows, they automatically dissipated when they were about to touch Han Jue.
Dao Sovereign and Jiang Yi’s hearts beat wildly when they saw Han Jue’s scarlet eyes.
“Oh no! I can’t bring him away!” Zhao Xuanyuan said anxiously, his tone revealing unprecedented panic.
“Dodge!” Dao Sovereign immediately ordered.
The three brothers suddenly moved. However, the moment they did so, they were hit by a terrifying force and fell through the spatial river, disappearing into the spatial
turbulence.
Han Jue turned around and discovered that countless Mystical Powers were attacking from all directions. Dazzling light of all colors filled the dark void.
Primordial Despair opened his mouth and suddenly sucked in all the Mystical Powers.
The million-foot-tall Divine Authority Generals and Destruction Authority Generals were really as tiny as ants in the face of Primordial Despair. The Ultimate God of Punishment and the Chaotic Consciousness Avatar continued to cast spells, creating more
and more Divine Authority Generals and Destruction Authority Generals. They rushed up one after another. The scene was
spectacular.
Han Jue watched the battle with relish as he
sat on Primordial Despair’s head. “Let all living beings see your ability.”
Han Jue’s voice sounded. He used the Dream
Entering Mystical Power to cover all living
beings.
From now on, anyone who entered the dream could watch the battle.
For a time, the entire Chaos stirred.
After the news spread, more and more living
beings entered their dreams to watch the battle. Even many disciples of the Darkness Sect stopped what they were doing to watch
the battle. They wanted to see the Dark Forbidden Lord’s true strength.
Han Huang, Primordial Origin, and Huang Zuntian, the three Primordial Fiendcelestials, attacked Primordial Despair. They used their Mystical Powers and wanted to suppress it. Primordial Despair, who had obtained the
power of the Lord, was extremely violent. As his figure trembled, he emitted endless negative karma that transformed into waves that swept in all directions.
Han Huang and the other two were forced
back.
Han Ling appeared above and bent down to look down at Primordial Despair. She was like a god looking down at the evil devils in the mortal world. Emperor Soldiers swooped down like a rain of arrows, targeting Han Jue.
Primordial Despair’s eighteen eyes looked up. Blood-colored pillars of light shot out. There were countless of them, and they destroyed one Emperor Soldier after another. In less than two breaths of time, ten million
Emperor Soldiers were all destroyed. The situation was grave!
The Dark Forbidden Lord had yet to make a
move. Just Primordial Despair alone made the Chaos and Primordial Chaos helpless. Han Huang was furious. He couldn’t approach
the Dark Forbidden Lord. He was going mad. He had no choice but to use the mysterious power that he had not used for a long time.
Ultimate Origin Power!
Han Jue felt that someone was borrowing his power and ignored it.
What would happen if Han Huang used the Ultimate Origin Power? The current Han Jue was a Creator Lord.
Han Huang’s expression changed drastically.
It actually failed.
…
In the third Dao Field.
Xing Hongxuan, Xuan Qingjun, Dao Comprehension Sword, and the other Dao Companions were watching the battle.
“It’s not optimistic. They can’t do anything to
Primordial Despair even with so many mighty figures attacking together,” Dao Comprehension Sword said worriedly.
Xing Hongxuan frowned at Primordial
Despair.
For some reason, she had a subtle feeling.
Although this fellow was ferocious, she couldn’t hate him no matter what. Could it be because Primordial Despair was created by Han Huang?
“From the looks of it, the difference is indeed
huge. Only someone at your level can turn the tide.” Xuan Qingjun sighed. The Chaos was filled with capable people.
In the past, Han Huang fighting all the living beings alone was already shocking enough. He didn’t expect the Dark Forbidden Lord to appear and for him to be so strong. As the women discussed, the final battle changed. Casualties began to appear on the Chaos’ side.
Primordial Despair stretched out a long tongue. Like a torrent of fate, it swept
into
This sudden change truly made the Chaos feel
despair.
The three Primordial Fiendcelestials and the Nine Chaos surrounded Primordial Despair, but they didn’t cause any damage. They would definitely lose at this rate.
Zhou Song smiled bitterly. “The difference is
too great.”
Su Qi was silent. He was not in despair.
Because he had always had hope. That was his master.
As long as his master took action, the trouble
that the Chaos and Primordial Chaos could not resolve would definitely be resolved.
how long are you going to watch the show?”
Han Jue’s voice sounded, moving the mighty figures fighting. Dao Creators?
Was that a realm above the Great Dao
Supreme?
Han Huang’s expression darkened. Could it be
that there were many existences at that
realm?
“Hmph!”
A cold snort shook the Dao hearts of all the Great Dao Supremes.
The darkness above was torn apart. A pair of eyes countless times larger than Primordial Despair appeared. They were like the eyes of the heavens, cold and dignified.
Dao Creator, Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction Venerable!
Primordial Despair did not care about the Dao
Creator. He was still frantically harvesting the Great Dao Sages, forcing them to continue
dealing with him before they could be shocked by Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction Venerable’s appearance. “Shi Tian’s creator, Immeasurable Destruction Venerable. I didn’t expect you to be the first to stand out.”
Han Jue’s indifferent identity reveal shocked
everyone from Shi Tian.
Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction Venerable snorted. “Dark Forbidden Lord, you want to change the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity? This is a path that leads to death!”
The eyes disappeared as soon as he finished speaking. A huge palm that was as vast as the Chaos landed. This scene reminded Han Huang of his father in the simulation trial.
Indeed, he was on the same level as his
father!


The Dao Creator’s power shocked all living beings. They even forgot their surprise.
Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction Venerable’s huge hand stretched towards Primordial Despair as if it wanted to grab him out of the Chaos.
The huge Primordial Despair was even smaller than a speck of sand in front of this hand. This was the first time Primordial
Despair was afraid. It let out a low roar and trembled.
Su Qi and Zhou Song raised their heads and were dumbfounded. They couldn’t believe their eyes.
What kind of power was this?
Could cultivation really reach this level?
This was the thought of all the mighty figures present.
Han Jue didn’t stand up. He raised his right hand and grabbed at the sky. In an instant, Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction Venerable’s huge hand seemed to be grabbed by an invisible force and distorted. Then, it shattered and dissipated like smoke.
This scene pulled all the mighty figures back to their senses.
Impossible!
Even the Dao Creator above the Great Dao couldn’t do anything to the Dark Forbidden Lord?
Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction Venerable did not say anything. At this moment, he was also very shocked, but he was too embarrassed to show it in front of all living beings.
Primordial Despair went mad again after the Dao Creator’s threat disappeared. His tongue, which was larger than the galaxy, quickly swept over dozens of Great Dao Sages and swallowed them.
The mighty figures became nervous again.
“Don’t stop. Kill. Your target is Primordial Despair. Leave the Dark Forbidden Lord to us!” Zhao Shuangquan shouted angrily.
He wanted to use his anger to suppress his panic. How could the people below fight if they panicked?
For a time, the chaotic battle erupted again.
However, facing the powerful and invincible Dark Forbidden Lord and Primordial Despair, even if the mighty figures tried their best, it was useless.
The living beings watching the battle in the dream became more and more afraid and desperate.
Was the Chaos really about to perish?
…
In the blank domain.
The Dao Creators gathered under the divine tree where the Ninth Chaos was cultivating.
Han Jue’s clone also came. He was summoned by the Ninth Chaos in his dreams, so he left the clone in the third Dao Field and rushed
over.
through it.
The Chaotic Consciousness, the Formless
Transcendent Deity, Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction Venerable, and the Yin-Yang
Purity Nirvana Deity all came.
They were all silent as they looked at the
Ninth Chaos.
Han Jue was expressionless, but he was teasing in his heart.
I’ll watch as you plot against me!
The Ninth Chaos said, “The greatest danger to
the Chaos has arrived. That Dark Forbidden Lord is far stronger than ordinary Dao
Creators.”
Ordinary Dao Creators…
Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction
Venerable’s expression was ugly. He saw Han Jue’s gaze and was even more humiliated.
The Formless Transcendent Deity asked, “Can you deal with him?”
The Ninth Chaos said, “I’m not confident.”
He had always underestimated the Dark Forbidden Lord, but he was shocked after seeing him easily break through the creation power of Shi Tian’s Immeasurable
Destruction Venerable.
Impossible!
One had to know that even the Ninth Chaos
couldn’t do it so easily. That huge hand was not a Mystical Power. It was the hand of Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction Venerable’s Supreme Treasure. With his body as a
Supreme Treasure, it was very difficult to destroy it in one strike.
“Since it’s so dangerous, I should hide in the Dao Field. Everyone knows that my Dao Field is very impressive. I can still survive.”
Han Jue frowned.
Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction Venerable said angrily, “How can you retreat
at such a critical moment? How long can you
hide? That Dark Forbidden Lord is hiding so deeply. He will find your Great Dao World sooner or later.”
Han Jue’s Great Dao World had always been in
the blank domain. All the Dao Creators knew.
The Formless Transcendent Deity was puzzled. Could it be that Han Jue really wanted to hide?
Thinking about his past, it was really possible.
But if that was the case, what would happen
to the Formless Transcendent Deity? The Chaotic Consciousness said in a low voice,
“We have to fight. We will join forces to fight the Dark Forbidden Lord. I suspect that if the Dark Forbidden Lord opens the Dark Era, he will definitely be stronger, even strong enough to kill a Dao Creator!”
The Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity remained
silent. The Ninth Chaos said, “That’s right, that’s
indeed the case. To be honest, I’ve been trying
to surpass the Dao Creator Realm, but I haven’t succeeded. The Dark Forbidden Lord
probably has the same goal. I don’t know how he succeeded. What I can confirm is that it’s related to the Dark Era.”
A higher realm!
The four Dao Creators’ hearts were heavy.
Han Jue was also acting.
The Ninth Chaos scanned them and said, “I’ll
give you one last chance to choose if you want to participate. If you succeed, I’ll tell you the method to attain a higher realm. Choose.” The Chaotic Consciousness and Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction Venerable chose to
participate.
The Formless Transcendent Deity and the Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity looked at Han Jue, showing their cards.
Han Jue said, “You guys fight first. I need
time. I’m about to break through. I will have a higher chance of winning when I successfully
break through.” Breakthrough?
The Dao Creators looked at him in surprise.
The Ninth Chaos thought to himself, “Is he going to break through to the late stage? How fast.”
He had never fought with Han Jue, but since the latter could suppress the Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity, he must be at the mid-stage. As for the late stage, how could he be so fast?
Now, Han Jue could only break through to the late-stage Dao Creator Realm. How long had the Chaos been born? The
Ninth Chaos had stayed in the Dao Creator Realm for so long. Just a minor realm took a trillion years or even longer. How long had Han Jue been born in this life?
There was a limit to his potential no matter
how stunning it was. The Formless Transcendent Deity and the Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity could only choose to participate.
The Ninth Chaos didn’t make things difficult for him.
Han Jue left.
The Ninth Chaos said, “Let’s go and think of a
way to move the Dark Forbidden Lord out of the Chaos to fight.”
The four Dao Creators had no objections. They rushed to the Chaos together. Speaking of which, this was the first time they fought
side by side. Their emotions were extremely subtle. They realized that their supreme era was about to end.
It was already like this now. When the
Endless Era arrived, there would definitely be more rising stars and more Dao Creators. Especially after the Ninth Chaos successfully broke through, the Dao Creator Realm would
no longer be the strongest and their status would naturally decrease. Thinking of this, they felt pity.
After fighting openly and secretly for so many
years, it was meaningless. On the other side.
More and more Great Dao Sages died in the
Primordial Despair’s mouth. His cultivation level of despair also rapidly increased.
The three Primordial Fiendcelestials and the
Nine Chaos were still thinking of ways to deal with the Dark Forbidden Lord, but they
couldn’t touch Han Jue at all.
At this moment, Han Jue suddenly stood up.
He sensed the aura of the Dao Creators. Finally!
He waited for a long time.
He could fight the five Dao Creators alone!


All the mighty figures fighting instantly became nervous upon seeing the Dark Forbidden Lord stand up.
The Dark Forbidden Lord was preparing to attack?
The scene of the Dark Forbidden Lord easily destroying the Chaotic Giant Hand was still vivid in their minds, making them shiver. The three Primordial Fiendcelestials attacked again. They used their strongest Mystical Powers and attacked with all their might. Boom-
The three Primordial Fiendcelestials were forced back. Their bodies were destroyed, leaving only their souls flying to the end of the dark void.
“Han Ye, did you notice that the Dark Forbidden Lord didn’t kill you?”
Han Yao and Han Ye attacked Primordial Despair together and sent a voice transmission.
Han Ye frowned. He had also noticed this.
No matter how those top mighty figures attacked the Dark Forbidden Lord, they did not die. What was the destruction of the body to a Great Dao Supreme?
What was the Dark Forbidden Lord trying to do?
Han Ye didn’t think that the Dark Forbidden Lord had good intentions and definitely had ulterior motives.
What was he coveting?
“All of you can continue fighting Primordial Despair. I’ll give it some power. As for me, I have to deal with the creators of the Chaos, Shi Tian, Consciousnessless, Transcendent, and Purity Great Dao Worlds. They are the strongest existences and stand above all living beings. If the Chaos is destroyed, they can also revive all living beings with a flip of their hand.
“However, if I appear again, that means they are dead. Next is you. No one can save you then.”
Han Jue’s voice echoed in the void and in the dreams of all living beings.
All living beings began to pray that the five transcendent existences must win!
Han Jue disappeared. Primordial Despair’s aura soared and became even more violent. Its long tongue swept out for countless kilometers and swept away hundreds of worlds and more than ten Great Dao Sages.
Li Daokong, Long Hao, and Murong Qi went to the top of Primordial Despair and prepared to save Su Qi. However, they could not move him no matter how many spells they cast. Su Qi and Zhou Song’s Great Dao Heaven seemed to have fused with Primordial Despair and could not be separated.
“How can this be?!”
Li Daokong was moved. He hated him and wanted to extract Su Qi’s soul and give up his
body, but he couldn’t do it.
The Dark Forbidden Lord’s power not only sealed Su Qi but also protected him.
Su Qi smiled bitterly. “Give up. You should think of a way to kill Primordial Despair. I will naturally be saved when the Dark Forbidden Lord dies.”
Li Daokong and the other two did not insist
and immediately moved out.
Zhou Song sighed. “Your Hidden Sect is really united.”
They tried to save Su Qi several times, but no
one cared about him.
Su Qi smiled. “Do you want to join us? I can introduce you.”
After so many years, they could not escape or
cultivate. They could only chat and build a
good friendship.
“Depends.”
Zhou Song sighed, his eyes filled with worry.
Primordial Despair became stronger after the Dark Forbidden Lord left. After obtaining the power of the Lord, it was definitely invincible now. If a Dao Creator did not appear, no one would be its match. It was useless to attack
together.
Countless Emperor Soldiers, Divine Authority Generals, and Destruction Authority Generals were like a torrent restraining Primordial Despair’s attention. Even so, the Great Dao Sages couldn’t do anything to it.
The pressure of the battle became stronger and stronger, causing the space at the edge of the Chaos to begin to collapse. The River of
Destiny and the River of Space-time appeared and twisted with the three thousand Great
Dao, ready to be destroyed at any time. Outside the Chaos, in the blank domain.
The five Dao Creators stood side by side. The Ninth Chaos was in the middle.
A black shadow appeared in front of them.
With every step, the black shadow doubled in
size and quickly surpassed all the Dao Creators.
The Chaotic Consciousness, the Formless Transcendent Deity, Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction Venerable, and the Yin-Yang
Purity Nirvana Deity felt immense pressure.
Even the Ninth Chaos had a heavy heart. It
was so close, but he still couldn’t see through the other party.
He didn’t understand where the other party got the guts to challenge them.
Could it be that he had already surpassed the
Dao Creator Realm?
This quickly appeared in the Ninth Chaos’
mind.
Could it be that the Dark Forbidden Lord had
existed longer than him and had only been hiding?
It was not impossible.
Otherwise, why couldn’t he sense the Dark
Forbidden Lord’s rise?
One had to know that the other Dao Creators
had not sensed his existence before…
The more Ninth Chaos thought about it, the more uneasy he became.
It had been a long time since he felt this way.
There was no point in thinking about this now. He could only fight.
it
disdain in his heart and stared at the Dark Forbidden Lord with all his attention. “Dark Forbidden Lord, it’s not too late to turn back now!” Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction Venerable shouted in a low voice. He panicked, but with so many Dao Creators
around him and the Ninth Chaos, he felt that his chances of winning were still quite high.
Since ancient times, the Dao Creators had never joined forces.
This battle would definitely be recorded in the annals of history!
Han Jue looked at them and smiled. “I’ve been
looking forward to this battle for a long time. Why would I turn back?”
With that, darkness spread to the entire blank
domain with him as the center. In the blink of
an eye, the blank domain fell into absolute
darkness.
Red flames burned around Han Jue, causing him to appear in the darkness.
The five Dao Creators were moved. What
method was this?
They could sense that they couldn’t escape
this darkness. In other words, they could only
fight!
The most hot-tempered Yin-Yang Purity
Nirvana Deity was the first to attack. He flashed behind Han Jue, and the endless power of space and time drowned the latter, pulling him into the spatial vortex. The other Dao Creators attacked one after another. The Chaotic Consciousness transformed into the figure of the Destruction
Authority General. This Destruction Authority General had nine eyes and an extremely terrifying aura. With a punch, his Dharmic powers condensed into a crimson ball of light that was like the sun and collided with Han
The Formless Transcendent Deity drew out the door with his hand. The door quickly rose and opened. The wind of time that was enough to destroy the Chaos swept out. In the wind were countless shadows. They were all Dao Seekers from ancient times. Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction Venerable condensed a huge hand again and pressed down on him.
The Ninth Chaos appeared in front of Han Jue.
The two of them stood facing each other, one big and one small. They were extremely close. A terrifying aura erupted. In an instant, endless afterimages burst out, as if countless Dark Forbidden Lords and the Ninth Chaos
were fighting. They shattered the spatial
turbulence and severed the huge wind, crushing Shi Tian’s huge hand. Han Jue deliberately suppressed his cultivation to the Dao Creator Realm to enjoy the fight. But even so, he quickly suppressed
the Ninth Chaos.
Boom-
The Ninth Chaos’ body was shattered by countless shadows. The figures were reversed as if they had fallen into an endless abyss.
The Ninth Chaos was the strongest Dao Creator, after all. He pulled out a wooden
sword from above his head with his right hand. This wooden sword seemed to be made of bones. He waved the sword and slashed. Billions of vitality burst out. Countless trees, surging waves, and layers of mountains scattered the shadows that filled the sky and collided with Han Jue.
The Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity descended from above. Transcendent Rule condensed under his feet and formed a dazzling light. However, before he could step on Han Jue’s head, it was blocked by an invisible force.


 The Chaotic Consciousness, the Formless Transcendent Deity, Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction Venerable, and the Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Destruction Deity were no threat to Han Jue at all. His opponent was still mainly the Ninth Chaos.
 It had to be said that the Ninth Chaos was indeed very strong. It was much stronger than the Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity.
 After suppressing his cultivation realm, Han Jue’s Dharmic powers were actually still higher than the Dao Creator. Even so, he couldn’t easily suppress the Ninth Chaos.
 Han Jue didn’t use the Mystical Power exclusive to the Divine Might Heavenly Sage. He only used the rules to fight. It was the same for the Ninth Chaos.
 To them, Mystical Powers were only for show. The true core was the rules themselves.
 Han Jue suddenly stopped. His body shook and he broke through the spatial turbulence of the Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity. Seven Supreme Rules condensed into seven dragons of different postures that coiled around his body.
 There were nine Supreme Rules in the Ultimate Origin World, but he only used seven in order not to expose his identity.
 There were seven Dao Creators!
 Seven was enough to deal with the Ninth Chaos!
 The Ninth Chaos raised his hand and grabbed at the void. He actually extracted the seven Supreme Rules around Han Jue and squeezed them into his palm. Then, he struck out. A terrifying pressure overturned the other four Dao Creators.
 Han Jue appeared behind the Ninth Chaos and turned into darkness to devour it.
 In an instant, Han Jue pulled the Ninth Chaos into an endless dream and experienced billions of lifetimes. When the Ninth Chaos broke through the dark dream, the other four Dao Creators had just stabilized themselves. Han Jue fought very happily. The Ninth Chaos didn’t disappoint him.
 According to his estimation, he, who was at the perfected Dao Creator Realm, needed 1% of a breath of time to kill the Ninth Chaos. If it was the Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity, he could insta-kill him ten million times.
 Of course, this was only killing, not
 destroying.
 The Dao Creator could revive infinitely. Victory and defeat were never decided by life
 and death.
 Seeing the Ninth Chaos being killed by Han Jue one after another, the four Dao Creators were shocked.
 So the Dark Forbidden Lord had really
 surpassed the Ninth Chaos!
 They couldn’t care less. They had to continue fighting even if they had to stall for time!
 Han Jue could naturally think of their plan.
 Unfortunately!
 This plan was wrong. The Endless Era could only be led by the Creator Lord!
 …
 In the depths of the chaos.
 The violent Primordial Despair began to
 rampage in the Chaos. Countless figures followed closely behind it. Countless Mystical
 Powers and Great Dao smashed into it, but
 they couldn’t slow it down.
 size of its eye.
 Boom-
 Han Huang collided with Primordial Despair
 and hugged its mouth with both hands to prevent it from opening it.
 At this moment, Han Huang, who had transformed into the Primordial Fiendcelestial, was also peerlessly majestic. Only he dared to act recklessly. Primordial Despair clearly remembered him and was
 unwilling to hurt him.
 Primordial Despair’s eighteen eyes landed on Han Huang, revealing a puzzled expression.
 Han Huang was stunned when he saw its
 gaze. Primordial Despair suddenly shook his head and sent Han Huang flying after being stunned for a moment.
 Primordial Despair’s intelligence was still too
 low. It was now instinctively excited. In its eyes, this was a gluttonous feast.
 Speaking of which, Primordial Despair was only following the orders he had arranged and did not betray him. However, its stance on
 this matter had changed, but it did not understand.
 A sword light that illuminated the heavens descended, wanting to cut Primordial Despair into two. However, the light of negative karma shot out from one of Primordial Despair’s eyes and easily destroyed it.
 Li Daokong frowned, his eyes filled with anger. He thought highly of himself, but this battle
 had been fought for a long time. All his attacks had failed.
 At this moment, a voice sounded, “Li Daokong, we have a way!”
 Li Daokong turned around and saw that Dao Sovereign and the other two who had been sent into the spatial turbulence by the Dark Forbidden Lord had returned. “What way?”
 Li Daokong frowned. Dao Sovereign sent him
 a voice transmission, causing his expression
 to change drastically.
 He did not answer immediately. Instead, he fell into a dilemma, his expression changing.
 Jiang Yi asked impatiently, “How is it? Have you decided?”
 The battle was still ongoing. There was not so much time for them to be conflicted. Li Daokong looked at Primordial Despair. The Nine Great Chaos were once again reduced to
 ashes by Primordial Despair’s long tongue. “Alright, I agree!”
 Li Daokong gritted his teeth. Dao Sovereign
 nodded. Then, the four of them gathered and meditated facing each other.
 They began to cast spells to place a formation.
 Their auras reached a unified state. No one was stronger or weaker.
 The battlefield was chaotic. Some were fighting, some were recuperating, and some were afraid, so no one cared about them.
 The main group of the Chaos and Primordial Chaos had been closely following Primordial Despair. In the distance, the cultivators of the various factions were scattering the various worlds along the way. Many mortals could not
 react in time and were taken away by their Dharma treasures. This was an unprecedented calamity that targeted all living beings indiscriminately.
 At this moment, no matter which corner, no
 matter how low a mortal was, they would terrified as long as they had intelligence. All sorts of civilizations were suffering the
 be
 despair of the Dark Forbidden Lord’s dream. Technology civilization, Slave civilization, Cultivation civilization, Alternate Deity civilization, High Martial civilization, and so
 on became extremely weak in this calamity. Han Ling blocked in front of Primordial Despair. Countless Emperor Soldiers flew out from the endless divine light behind her. Primordial Despair’s eyes landed on her. He suddenly stopped just as he stuck out his
 tongue.
 Primordial Despair was stunned for a moment before looking at the other living beings. He waved his tongue and swept away several
 Great Dao Sages. Han Ling frowned under her mask. She
 sensed that something was wrong. This was not the first time. Primordial Despair almost hurt her a few times but stopped in time.
 Why was that?
 Could it be that he had a portion of Han Huang’s will?
 No one knew how Han Huang created Primordial Despair, and he was unwilling to
 say.
 Boom-
 A terrifying pressure came, startling all the
 living beings. Even Primordial Despair stopped and slowly turned around. Dao Sovereign, Zhao Xuanyuan, Jiang Yi, and Li Daokong meditated facing each other. bodies emitted a strong light, forming a huge pillar that connected the Supreme Rules. The pillar of light was like a crack in the door that
 was slowly opening.
 Their
 A terrifying figure appeared in the pillar of light.
 “What’s that?”
 Ji Xianshen was surprised. He felt the power of space and time.
 He suddenly thought of something and his expression changed drastically.
 Could it be that fellow?
 How did he find Dao Sovereign and the other three?
 Ji Xianshen was puzzled. “How lively. I still caught up to this battle
 that established the Endless Era.”
 A cold voice sounded with a hint of madness.


 The sudden arrival of the mysterious expert made the entire battlefield silent. That terrifying aura made them think of the Dao Creator who had attacked earlier.
 Another Dao Creator above the Great Dao!
 Which side did he belong to?
 The mighty figures heaved a sigh of relief when they saw Dao Sovereign and the other three.
 It was an ally!
 Li Daokong looked up and asked in a low voice, “Are you sure he’s helping us?”
 Those words gave him a bad feeling.
 Dao Sovereign said, “Yes, it should be.” Should?
 Li Daokong’s expression instantly darkened.
 The pillar of light became larger and larger, and the mysterious expert’s figure was also revealed more and more. From his figure, he was probably in human form. He was extremely majestic and was even larger than the three Primordial Fiendcelestials present. For the first time, Primordial Despair was filled with fear. He roared at the mysterious expert in a low voice as his eighteen eyes stared in the same direction.
 Soon, a man in silver armor and a miniature world above his head stepped out. He was handsome and dignified. Countless divine weapons of different sizes and forms floated behind him. As he stepped forward, the silver pieces on the armor swayed and emitted a soul-stirring sound. The weak cultivators were all entranced and their consciousness fell into chaos.
 All the living beings watching the battle in the dream were fine. With Han Jue’s power isolating them, this silver-armored man was not enough to threaten them.
 “I am Heavenly Venerate Xun. Remember my name. I am here to save you!” the silver-armored man said proudly, looking down on Primordial Despair.
 He raised his palm and struck. Countless divine weapons soared into the sky and drew countless beautiful arcs in the dark void. It was like a sea of stars descending. It was unstoppable and extremely fast. All of them landed on Primordial Despair, causing him to wail.
 For the first time, cracks appeared on Primordial Despair’s surface. Blood flowed out like a chaotic sea, looking abnormally
 miserable.
 “Dao Creator!”
 Han Huang stared at Heavenly Venerate Xun
 and clenched his fists.
 Another Dao Creator!
 How many Dao Creators were hidden in the
 Chaos?
 He wasn’t the only one. The other mighty figures standing at the top of the Chaos also had mixed emotions.
 Thinking back, they suddenly felt ashamed. They thought that they were invincible. Even
 if there were opponents, they couldn’t surpass them much. They did not expect…
 Heavenly Venerate Xun’s attack was
 extremely domineering, causing Primordial Despair’s body to begin to dismember. This pleasantly surprised all living beings.
 The Chaos was saved?
 Primordial Despair felt the pain and
 towards Heavenly Venerate Xun. Its aura was
 still increasing.
 Heavenly Venerate Xun looked surprised and immediately said disdainfully, “The power of a Dao Creator. No wonder. However, your body can’t withstand such a powerful force! “You will die today no matter what you are!” Heavenly Venerate Xun raised his right hand, and strong light burst out from it. The River of Space-time surged out with the light. This river condensed into a divine staff. The top was like a crescent moon and its body was like a tree root cast from molten iron.
 The Divine Staff hung upside down and blasted towards Primordial Despair. Space-time took the form of a silver-colored torrent and drowned Primordial Despair with an unstoppable domineering force. In the torrent, Primordial Despair’s body dried up at a speed visible to the naked eye, as if it was rapidly aging. Soon, only skin and bones were left, looking extremely terrifying.
 All living beings were overjoyed. Was he going
 At this moment, Primordial Despair’s flesh
 began to recover. His recovery speed was even faster than before. In less than two breaths of time, Primordial Despair recovered to his peak and his aura was even stronger.
 “Roar!”
 Primordial Despair roared and spat out a
 terrifying black pillar of light. It dispersed the spatial torrent and attacked Heavenly
 Venerate Xun.
 Heavenly Venerate Xun frowned and raised
 his left hand to block this force.
 “I underestimated you.’
 Heavenly Venerate Xun snorted and used his
 Mystical Power again.
 The mighty figures of the entire battlefield retreated and handed Primordial Despair to Heavenly Venerate Xun.
 Why was this happening…
 The existence he created was actually stronger than him.
 Even if he had obtained the power of the Dark Forbidden Lord, why had he increased so
 much in such a short period of time? Could it be that the Dao Creator was really a natural chasm? As long as he crossed it, he could look down on all the realms below?
 …
 In the blank domain, in the dark domain
 covered by the power of the Lord. The Chaotic Consciousness, the Formless Transcendent Deity, Shi Tian’s Immeasurable
 Destruction Venerable, and the Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity were all wrapped in the black aura and bound into a row, unable to
 move.
 They could only look at the Ninth Chaos fighting the Dark Forbidden Lord. However, the situation was not optimistic.
 The Dark Forbidden Lord was high and
 mighty. His right hand grabbed the void and used endless Mystical Powers from afar. All sorts of Dark Mystical Powers he had
 temporarily created landed on the Ninth Chaos.
 The Ninth Chaos had already been destroyed
 countless times and was still fighting bitterly.
 At this point, the Ninth Chaos had already given up on defeating Han Jue. He only wanted to stall for time and give the Chaos a
 chance.
 The power of the Creator Lord transformed into countless black heavenly pillars and descended, suppressing the Ninth Chaos. The Ninth Chaos’ soul dissipated and condensed
 again, attacking Han Jue from behind. The power of the seven Supreme Rules condensed in the Ninth Chaos’ palms into an extremely strong force. A strong light burst
 out and countless Great Dao runes exploded, drowning Han Jue.
 In the next second, the strong light and Great
 Dao runes shrank and landed in Han Jue’s
 hand.
 He could crush the power of the Seven
 Supreme Rules at any time.
 The Ninth Chaos was shocked.
 He must have broken through!
 He was definitely not a Dao Creator!
 The Ninth Chaos stopped at this moment.
 Han Jue asked teasingly, “Why did you stop?” The Ninth Chaos asked in a low voice, “Have you already surpassed the Dao Creator Realm?”
 “That’s right!”
 Han Jue didn’t hide anything. At this point,
 there was no need to. The Ninth Chaos was silent.
 Han Jue smiled. “If you give up, your Chaos
 will die. You will also die.”
 The Ninth Chaos indeed panicked, but he was still thinking of a way. “You can kill me, but let all the living beings
 in the Chaos go,” the Ninth Chaos said in a
 low voice.
 The four Dao Creators were shocked, not
 daring to believe that the Ninth Chaos would bow its head.
 Surpassing a Dao Creator…
 They were also in despair. No wonder they couldn’t defeat the Dark
 Forbidden Lord even after they joined forces… Why was this happening… Who was the Dark Forbidden Lord?
 Han Jue smiled. “The Chaos must be destroyed.” “You…”
 The Ninth Chaos was furious. He hated the
 Dark Forbidden Lord, to begin with. Seeing
 how domineering he was, he no longer had any illusions and immediately attacked. Han Jue stopped pretending and raised his hand. The power of the Creator Lord
 the Ninth Chaos and said coldly.
