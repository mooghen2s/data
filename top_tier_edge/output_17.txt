 After the golden bell shattered, Zhou Fan finally believed that the Seven Dao Sage had been beaten away by Han Jue.
 Master said that the Seven Dao Sage was gone…
 He was gone… Was he dead?
 Zhou Fan turned to look at him in disbelief. Han Jue raised his hand and prepared to put him into his sleeve. “Wait! Master, you can go back first. Since the Seven Dao Sage is gone, I want to occupy his treasure!” Zhou Fan suddenly said with an excited expression.
 Han Jue frowned and asked, “Are you confident?”
 “100%.”
 “Alright!” Han Jue turned around and entered the black vortex.
 After returning to the Daoist temple, Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief. Just now, he had been worried that he would encounter an existence that surpassed the Great Dao.
  Han Jue took out the Book of Misfortune and tried to curse the Seven Dao Sage. Indeed, the curse power was absorbed. He immediately gave up. Curse Fiendcelestial! Courting death! Han Jue frowned and began to think about how to eliminate the Curse Fiendcelestial. If he didn’t get rid of this fellow, he would protect whoever he cursed in the future. Sooner or later, he would create a huge alliance that hated him.
 Han Jue suddenly thought of Divine Lord Peacock.
 Should he make Divine Lord Peacock kill the Curse Fiendcelestial? He could get rid of the Inauspicious Divine Emperor! Han Jue immediately sent a dream to Divine Lord Peacock.
 In the dream, Divine Lord Peacock saw Han Jue, who had transformed into the Dark Forbidden Lord. He revealed a bitter expression and asked, “Since I submitted to you, why did you let the Inauspicious Divine Emperor pursue me?” Han Jue said indifferently, “Is the Inauspicious Divine Emperor really chasing after you?” Divine Lord Peacock coughed. “I can’t find a place to cultivate. I’m staying in the territory of the Inauspicious Evil. The other cultivators don’t dare to disturb me.”
 Han Jue finally understood. The reason why this fellow kept being beaten was because he refused to leave the Inauspicious Divine Emperor’s territory. The Inauspicious Divine Emperor didn’t expose his lie?
 “Leave. I’ll arrange a mission for you to kill the Curse Fiendcelestial,” Han Jue said.
 Divine Lord Peacock asked in surprise, “Curse Fiendcelestial? Aren’t you the Curse Fiendcelestial?”.
 Han Jue said disdainfully, “Curse is only one of the Great Dao I control. This Fiendcelestial has just been born and his cultivation level is not strong. It’s enough for you to deal with. It’s a test for you.
 How to find him depends on you.” Divine Lord Peacock immediately replied, “No problem. The Inauspicious Divine Emperor is too strong, but why should I be afraid of him?” This was not the first time Divine Lord Peacock had challenged a Chaotic Fiendcelestial. He was not afraid at all.
 Han Jue directly released the dream.
 He was afraid that if Divine Lord Peacock made a request, he would not be able to satisfy it. At the same time, he could maintain his status as the Dark Forbidden Lord!
 Han Jue adjusted his state of mind.
 Killing the Seven Dao Sage made him sigh.
 The once high and mighty existence had already fallen from the altar.
 He couldn’t always rely on his Dharma treasure. The key was whether his fist was hard or not!
 In a dark hall, the Evil Heavenly Emperor sat lazily on the Emperor’s throne and looked down at the argument between the immortals.
 “This is not a good time to enter the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End!”
 “How much longer do we have to wait?” “The Deity Realm of the Ruins of End is already in chaos. Taking the opportunity to recruit immortals is the main goal of the Heavenly Court’s development.” “We don’t even have information about the Ancient Desolate. How can we dare to go?” “It’s said that the Devil Ancestor has already escaped from the Ancient Desolate. If he’s in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End, won’t we be courting death if we go there?”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor did not interrupt their argument. He was still thinking about something else.
 At this moment.
 An old immortal flew into the hall and said anxiously, “Report-Master of the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End, Seven Dao Sage has died!” With that said, the hall fell silent. All the immortals were stunned.
 Seven Dao Sage! Most of the immortals of the Heavenly Court came from the Little Heavenly Dao or the Chaos. They knew a lot about the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End. Among them, the Seven Dao Sage was famous and could be considered an outstanding figure among the Great Dao Sages.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor was also shocked. He subconsciously sat up straight and asked in a low voice, “Is that true?” The old immortal said anxiously, “It’s true. The news of the Seven Dao Sage’s death has already spread. The Great Dao Tower has been occupied by a cultivator called Zhou Fan!”
 Zhou Fan?
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor calculated with his fingers and could not figure out which Zhou Fan it was.
 The immortals were in an uproar and continued to argue. The immortals who had supported going to the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End all shut up and did not dare to talk about going there anymore.
 Even the Seven Dao Sage had died. Who would dare to go to the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End? The Evil Heavenly Emperor frowned and fell into deep thought. The Seven Dao Sage’s death was definitely a terrifying sign. He knew that the Seven Dao Sage belonged to the same circle as many Great Dao Sages. It was very likely that a new faction had killed him. The Evil Heavenly Emperor said in a low voice, “Alright!”
 The immortals shut up and turned to look at him. The Evil Heavenly Emperor instructed, “Investigate immediately where the Seven Dao Sage died and who killed him! “Gather the Heavenly Troops and retreat!” The immortals did not dare to have any objections and immediately agreed.
 Time passed. A thousand years passed in the blink of an eye.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and heaved a sigh of relief. Comfortable!
 Ever since he broke through to the late stage of the Freedom Primordial Chaos Realm, his cultivation speed had slowed down.
 The reason why Han Jue set it as a thousand years was that he was worried that something would happen to his disciples and he wouldn’t have time to take care of them. On second thought, with the Myriad Worlds Projection, if anything happened to the outer sect disciples, they should be able to inform the disciples in the Hundred Peak Immortal River. Unless the other party did not want to inform them, they would only have themselves to blame if they died.
 Han Jue decided to enter seclusion for five thousand years each time!
 He looked at Xing Hongxuan, who was cultivating in the Daoist temple next door. Ever since she became pregnant, Xing Hongxuan had been cultivating in seclusion. She had been feeding the child in her womb and had seldom gone out. During this period of time, Xing Hongxuan’s cultivation level had been increasing. She had unknowingly broken through to the mid-stage Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm!
 Xing Hongxuan was using the child as a cultivation device?
 Han Jue suddenly suspected that the reason why this child didn’t appear was that his mother didn’t want to give birth to him. Cough cough! He was thinking too much. Han Jue looked at the mother and son for a while and started to check his emails. Every time he looked at his friends’ situation, he felt like he was opening a loot box.
 (Your good friend Divine Lord Peacock was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure.)
 [Your son Han Tuo accidentally entered the Chaotic Mystic Realm.]
 (Your good friend Ancestor Xitian was attacked by your enemy, Jade Bodhi.)
  (Your disciple Zhou Fan was attacked by a mysterious Dao Devil) x66520942
 [Your good friend Pan Xin was cursed by a mysterious curse.)
 (Your good friend Jiang Dugu received guidance from a mysterious mighty figure. His cultivation has increased greatly.)
 (Your good friend Empress Houtu received guidance from a mysterious mighty figure and used her strength to attain the Dao and obtain the Primordial Chaos Dao Fruit.]
 Empress Houtu had attained the Dao! Han Jue checked his emails. Indeed, Empress Tu had already left the Heavenly Dao hundreds of years ago. Who taught Empress Houtu? Could it be the mysterious Ancestral Magus Di Jiang?


 Han Jue didn’t spend his lifespan deducing why Empress Houtu had attained the Dao. There was no need. After all, everyone had their own encounters. It was fine as long as they couldn’t threaten him.
 He continued reading the emails.
 He discovered that many of his good friends had opportunities. The atmosphere of the past had finally returned.
 Peace was better.
 Han Jue perked up and continued cultivating.
 Outside the 33rd Heaven. Pangu Hall. Pan Xin, Emperor Xiao, and Jin Shen gathered.
 Emperor Xiao asked, “Can we really not rope Huang Zuntian in?”
 Pan Xin shook his head. “This child is determined to follow Sect Master Tian Jue. He’s too timid.” Jin Shen did not interrupt. “Recently, I’ve been preparing to open a path to the depths of the Chaos. On this path, all living beings will be protected by the Heavenly Dao and not be attacked by the Chaotic Evils. I need someone to determine the destination and where this path should lead,” Pan Xin said excitedly.
 Once he succeeded, he would open the passageway between the Heavenly Dao and the Chaos, allowing the living beings of the Heavenly Dao to better explore the Chaos. He would also obtain Immeasurable Merit.
 Pan Xin gave a few more instructions before Emperor Xiao left.
 He then glanced at Jin Shen and asked, “Xuan Du has been quite close to you recently. Why?” Jin Shen replied, “The Heavenly Venerate wants to control a Little Heavenly Dao with me. He has already chosen a place. If I control that Little Heavenly Dao, it will be beneficial to you.” Hearing this, Pan Xin snorted. “Xuan Du really has good intentions. He usually pretends to be emotionless, but he actually has more thoughts than anyone else.”
 Jin Shen was silent.
 “Arrange for some geniuses to join the Hidden Sect. I want to know what kind of force Han Jue’s Hidden Sect is,” Pan Xin instructed.
 Jin Shen agreed. The strongest force in the current Immortal World was naturally the Hidden Sect. All living beings might not think so, but the Sages saw through it very clearly.
 Han Jue seemed to be keeping a low profile, but he had been developing the secret forces of the Hidden Sect. His intentions were unfathomable.
 Time passed quickly. Five thousand years passed. Han Jue opened his eyes, stood up, and stretched. Awesome!
 Cultivating in seclusion for five thousand years was indeed better than a thousand years! It was as if he had a dream. After waking up, his cultivation level had increased greatly. He could continue this trend in the future! Han Jue opened his interpersonal relationships and discovered that the disciples and good friends he cared about were still there and hadn’t died.
 Indeed, no matter who the world left, it would still change. Han Jue immediately felt less burdened. He could cultivate in peace in the future. He discovered that Li Xuan’ao was waiting outside the Hundred Peak Immortal River and moved him into the Daoist temple.
 Li Xuan’ao was stunned. He looked at Han Jue with a bitter gaze and couldn’t help but say, “Sect Master, I came five times. You’re finally willing to see me!”
 He almost thought that he had done something wrong and offended him.
 Han Jue smiled. “From now on, every time I enter seclusion it will be for five thousand years. You can tell the other disciples.” Li Xuan’ao heaved a sigh of relief and smiled. “Don’t worry. The current Hidden Sect is already a colossus. No one in the Immortal World can shake us. For example, the other Sage Sects rarely interfere. They are all busy cultivating.”
 Han Jue felt that it made sense.
 In the Dark Forbidden Zone, Han Tuo and Yi Tian led a million Heavenly Troops into the void. They were all facing a direction. It was a huge tower. It was impossible to see how many floors there were. This tower stood quietly. Countless demonic birds circled around it. The number was even greater than the Heavenly Troops led by Han Tuo and the others. Yi Tian swallowed and asked, “Are we really going?” Han Tuo frowned and said in a low voice, “Should we retreat? How embarrassing!” “The Great Dao Tower is too strange. Just by looking at it, I feel like my soul is being sucked away. We’re already like this, let alone the younger ones.”
 Yi Tian cursed in a low voice, his tone nervous. Han Tuo began to think of a solution. At this moment, a voice entered his ears. “Fight all you want. I’ll attack too!” It was the Evil Heavenly Emperor... Han Tuo heaved a sigh of relief when he heard that. He immediately took out a divine spear. This spear was ten feet long and was surrounded by a red dragon and a golden dragon. Its aura was oppressive. “Heavenly Troops, listen up! Follow me and kill until we obtain the Great Dao Tower!”
 An ancient voice came from the pillar of light. “Are you sure you want to take this path? The Seven Dao Sage has failed for tens of billions of years.” Zhou Fan opened his eyes and said in high spirits, “I’m stronger than him! I’ll definitely do it!”
  “Strange, you’ve clearly stepped onto the Great Dao. This Great Dao won’t reject my Dao.”
 “Nonsense. Otherwise, how can I be confident?” Zhou Fan snorted and admired Han Jue even more. The Great Dao that Han Jue taught them was so powerful!
 The ancient voice said, “Forget it. Since you’ve obtained the Great Dao Tower, I’ll let you inherit this Dao. This will be a path of no return. You need to constantly fight and kill.”
 Zhou Fan said proudly, “I’ve never been afraid of battle. I was born to fight!”
 Boom
 The Great Dao Tower shook violently, clearly suffering a powerful impact. Zhou Fan stood up and cursed. “Again! Do you really think that I, Zhou Fan, am a pushover? You can snatch me whenever you want? This time, I want to see who dares to try me!”


 Han Tuo stepped on the roof of the Great Dao Tower like a cannonball. The terrifying force shook the Great Dao Tower violently.
 Dozens of demonic birds pounced at him. He swept his spear and his Dharmic powers transformed into golden winds that swept in all directions, killing all the attacking demonic birds. At this moment!
 A terrifying pressure descended, startling Han Tuo so much that he looked up. A window above suddenly opened, and a pitch-black demon with four wings crawled out. It had a burly figure and a snake-like face. It was cold and evil.
 Han Tuo acted as if he was facing a great enemy. He formed a seal with his left hand and a golden word appeared out of thin air. It entered his body and transformed into a layer of golden light that wrapped around his body. The four-winged black demon transformed into a black wind and swept down at an extremely fast speed, pressing down on Han Tuo. On the other side, Yi Tian also fell into a fierce battle.
 Many Pseudo-Sage and Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal demons were hidden in the Great Dao Tower. The number of ordinary demons was even greater than the Heavenly Troops. The situation was not optimistic for the Heavenly Court.
 Boom!
 A door at the top of the Great Dao Tower suddenly opened. Zhou Fan, dressed in a black robe, slowly walked out. His aura was like flames and his eyes were cold. He walked out of the darkness like a demon god from the netherworld. Holy might descended!
 Han Tuo, Yi Tian, and the million Heavenly Troops were all shocked.
  Sage!
 Zhou Fan looked down at the million Heavenly Troops and roared, “You thieves dare to try to snatch my Great Dao Tower? You’re courting death!”
 His gaze quickly landed on Han Tuo. He could sense that his aura was the strongest. He should be the leader.
 The next second, his expression became subtle.
 Han Tuo looked at him. One had a solemn expression and the other looked slightly stunned.
 Five thousand years passed.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and felt the improvement in his cultivation. He smiled in satisfaction.
 A few more times and he could break through again. To mortals, five thousand years might be the time a civilization rose and fell, but to Han Jue, it was like sleeping. It passed very quickly. Han Jue looked at Xing Hongxuan first. Yes, his son had yet to be born. From the looks of it, he might be nurtured for tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of years.
 The twelve Ancestral Magi, Three Pure Ones, Dijun, Eastern Emperor Tai Yi, Nüwa, and the other mighty figures had been nurtured for an era. After the first Immeasurable Calamity ended, they were born and directly became top-notch existences in the world.
 Han Jue looked at the Immortal World again. During this period of time, more than ten Pseudo-Sages and a hundred Zenith Heaven Golden Immortals had appeared in the Immortal World. There were countless living beings below the next realm, and the number of living beings had reached an extremely exaggerated number. Han Jue discovered that the Immortal World had also expanded greatly. Be it the Immortal World or the mortal world, they were both flourishing.
 The Sages managed it well. Han Jue nodded in satisfaction.
 Deciding to guide them, Han Jue summoned the two through voice transmission. The two of them quickly came to visit.
 In fact, they had long wanted to visit Han Jue, but they were afraid of disturbing his cultivation and also felt embarrassed.
 After entering the temple, the two of them knelt down and bowed.
 (Your good friend Divine Lord Peacock was attacked by your enemy, Curse Fiendcelestial.]
 (Your good friend Empress Houtu created the Magus Race. Her providence has increased greatly.)
 (Your good friend Huang Zuntian has entered the Dark Forbidden Zone.)
 (Your disciple Zhou Fan was attacked by your son, Han Tuo.]
 (Your disciple Zhou Fan was attacked by a mysterious Dao Devil] x3902247
 (Your good friend Ancestor Xitian was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure and was severely injured.]
 (Your good friend Immortal Emperor Samsara accidentally obtained the Earth Book. His providence has increased greatly.]
 Divine Lord Peacock had found the Curse Fiendcelestial so quickly!
 Not bad! Unfortunately, he didn’t kill the other party. Han Jue thought silently. Looking down, he saw the emails of the battle between Divine Lord Peacock and the Curse Fiendcelestial. Divine Lord Peacock still had something. Han Jue only saw that the Curse Fiendcelestial was severely injured, but he didn’t see Divine Lord Peacock injured.
 Han Jue was not surprised to see Empress Houtu create the Magus Race. After all, she had always had such thoughts. Di Jiang probably supported her from behind the scenes.
 The current Han Jue could already look at the existences in those ancient myths, so he was not surprised.
 Further down.
 Why was Zhou Fan fighting Han Tuo?
 Fortunately, Han Tuo was not injured. Zhou Fan was still sensible. Han Tuo was Han Jue’s son, after all. If his disciple hurt his son, it would be a slap to his face! After reading the emails, Han Jue began the simulation trial.
 Ten years later. Jiang Yi and Zhao Xuanyuan left the Daoist temple and returned to their respective residences to cultivate. Han Jue also began to cultivate in seclusion again. In less than a hundred years, Zhao Xuanyuan and Jiang Yi became Pseudo-Sages one after another, shocking the Hundred Peak Immortal River. On a mountain peak in the Hundred Peak Immortal River, seven disciples gathered in a cave abode.
 A red-robed man sighed. “The Hidden Sect is really terrifying. They can casually produce two Pseudo-Sages.” The others also sighed. “That’s right. The number of Deity Realm experts has already exceeded 100,000. This is only in the Hundred Peak Immortal River.”
 “The Hidden Sect should be the number one force in the Heavenly Dao now.” “Sigh, why don’t we really follow the Hidden Sect?”
 They were investigating the Hidden Sect and did not want to harm it. There wasn’t much pressure.
 That’s right, they were spies arranged by Jin Shen. After seeing the foundation of the Hundred Peak Immortal River, they were shaken.
  Jin Shen was a Sage, but the Hidden Sect had two Sages!
 The red-robed man gritted his teeth. “In any case, we haven’t sent a message to Jin Shen. Let’s pretend that nothing happened. We’re still disciples of the Hidden Sect!” The other six heaved a sigh of relief.
 Jin Shen promised them that he would personally preach the Dao to them and even help them establish a providence sect. Before this, they were indeed tempted.


 Jin Shen was silent for a moment before saying, “I don’t have any disciples, to begin with. I cultivate in the Heavenly Dao in a low profile manner. The seven people I sent out have only received my guidance before and are not too familiar with each other.” Pan Xin said angrily, “Then, why did you send them?”
 “What can I do if you requested for me to do
 it?”
 “You should have said so earlier!”
 Pan Xin almost went berserk.
 It turned out that this fellow did not have any trusted subordinates.
 Jin Shen was silent.
 For some reason, Pan Xin felt that this fellow was mocking him.
 He was stronger than Jin Shen, but in the Heavenly Dao, the Sages could not be killed unless they lost their minds and used other methods to sever the providence of the Heavenly Dao. Pan Xin realized that he needed to use something other than strength to win the hearts of the people. No wonder those Sages were very hypocritical and liked to scheme.
 Sometimes, schemes were more useful and lethal than fists.
 Pan Xin sighed. “Forget it, let’s put the Hidden Sect aside for the time being. Emperor Xiao has already found a suitable Chaotic World. In at most ten thousand, years, I will open a passage to this world. At that time, it will definitely not be easy for anyone to enter. We have to set up a threshold in the early stages. You can nurture your own force. I will let your disciple enter this path in advance and go to the Chaotic World to seek opportunities.”
 Hearing this, Jin Shen was moved and immediately thanked him.
 Updates by
 In the Dark Forbidden Zone, the Great Dao Tower floated quietly. There were countless demon birds and Heavenly Troops around. A floating stone pavilion was between the two forces. Zhou Fan and the Evil Heavenly Emperor sat opposite each other. Han Tuo and Yi Tian stood behind the Evil Heavenly Emperor, their bodies like mountains. Zhou Fan smiled and said, “It’s settled, then. In the future, the Dark Forbidden Zone and the Hidden Sect will split the world equally with the Heavenly Court.” The Evil Heavenly Emperor smiled and nodded. After preparing for thousands of years, he finally prepared a huge plan that satisfied Zhou Fan.
 Once this plan succeeded, the Heavenly Court would definitely soar!
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor smiled and asked, “How has your master been recently? What’s his attitude when the Seven Dao Sage was killed?”
 Zhou Fan said, “He’s been cultivating. It’s nothing. As for the Seven Dao Sage, how can he know him?”
 He wasn’t stupid. It was impossible for him to say that the Seven Dao Sage’s true ‘murderer was Han Jue. Seven Dao Sage was a Great Dao Sage! How old was Han Jue? He actually had the strength to kill a Great Dao Sage! It would be troublesome once such news spread!
 He had heard that the Seven Dao Sage was on good terms with many mighty figures. Previously, the calamities that attacked the Heavenly Dao were all instigated by these mighty figures. “That’s true.” The Evil Heavenly Emperor revealed a nostalgic expression. After experiencing so many things, he always missed the past.
 In the past, he had enjoyed endless glory in the Heavenly Dao and had countless descendants. However, in the end, none of his subordinates were his family.
 At the mention of this, Han Tuo also revealed a curious expression. Zhou Fan hesitated for a moment before saying, “Since you already know, I won’t hide it. Master’s son is impressive and is still being nurtured. I’ve never heard of a human fetus being nurtured for so long. He will definitely be an earth-shattering figure in the future. He might be able to inherit my master’s talent.”
 Yi Tian smiled at Han Tuo in a low voice, “Don’t be jealous of your brother.” Han Tuo rolled his eyes. “We are related by blood. Why would I be jealous? I’m just curious how Father will treat him.”
 Yi Tian understood what he meant.
 After Han Tuo became an adult, he traveled the world alone. He had no one to rely on, just like Yi Tian. Therefore, the two of them were close because they could resonate emotionally.
 If Han Tuo’s younger brother was doted on in every way, Yi Tian wouldn’t feel good either.
 Several hours later.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor stood up and said, “That’s all. I’ll let Han Tuo find you next time. You should control the Great Dao Tower as soon as possible. This treasure is the key!”
 Zhou Fan nodded. “Then, I won’t send you off.”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor waved his hand and led the immortals away.
 Han Jue entered seclusion for another five thousand years. His lifespan had already exceeded 220,000 years. He was getting closer and closer to the perfected Freedom Primordial Chaos Realm.
 Han Jue was very satisfied with this cultivation progress. He would probably break through after three more times. After reaching the perfected realm, he should break through to the Great Dao Sage Realm!
 Han Jue was about to observe the Immortal World when a voice entered his ears.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du!
 He really knew how to time things! Han Jue looked up. After confirming that there were no unfamiliar Sages outside the 33rd Heaven, he moved into the Universal Hall.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du smiled and gestured for him to sit down. “Fellow Daoist Han is so hardworking. I’m afraid you can attain the Great Dao in ten million years.” Ten million years? Who was he looking down on? Han Jue chuckled. “How is that possible?”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “If it were any other prodigy, even Divine Lord Peacock, I would also think that it’s impossible. But you, I think that everything is possible.” Han Jue laughed helplessly. I’ll attain the Great Dao in a hundred thousand years!
 Of course, Han Jue didn’t dare to be arrogant in front of him. He couldn’t show his strength to others.
 “Tell me, what is it?” Han Jue asked.
 The providence of the Heavenly Dao increased again. It seemed that everything was going smoothly. Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “Recently, Pan Xin has been trying to rope in other Sages. Heavenly Venerate Wufa, Qiu Xilai, and Sect Master Tian Jue are very close to him. We have to be wary.”
 He almost wanted to laugh. If it was any other Sage, he might really be worried.
 In the end, Pan Xin had roped in his three slaves.
  Wasn’t this jumping into his trap?
 Han Jue asked, “Do you need me to ask them? They were defeated by me before. They should give me some face.” He no longer cared about Pan Xin.
 If this fellow really wanted to break the peace of the Heavenly Dao, then he couldn’t blame him for being impolite.
 Although they were good friends, Pan Xin’s favorability was not high.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du shook his head. “No need for the time being. I’m just reminding you. Do you have a way to defeat him?”
 Han Jue said, “We’ve never fought. If he really threatens the peace of the Heavenly Dao, I’ll definitely do my best. Of course, it’s not just him. If any Sage dares to destroy the peace of the Heavenly Dao, I won’t let them go!”


 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du thought that Han Jue was also warning him? Although that was what he thought, Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du did not panic at all. He indeed had selfish motives and was also developing his connections. However, he had no choice. If he was really greedy for power, he wouldn’t have returned at all. If he stayed in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End and followed a group of Great Dao Sages, wouldn’t he be extremely powerful?
 The reason why he returned was to protect his hometown and the Heavenly Dao that gave birth to him! Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du continued, “I will continue to observe Pan Xin. If he doesn’t affect the survival of the Heavenly Dao, I will turn a blind eye to him.
 “In addition, what do you think about the Reincarnation Space?”
 Han Jue said, “It was your idea, to begin with. You decide.”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said in a low voice, “I plan to push the Reincarnation Space into the Chaos. Otherwise, there’s no need for the Reincarnation Space to exist by relying on the power of the mortal world. After all, the Earth Immortal World already belongs to the Heavenly Dao.” “Sure, you can arrange it.”
 Han Jue nodded and acted like he was in charge.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du wasn’t angry. Instead, he was happy to see this. If Han Jue interfered more, it would be difficult for him to show off. The reason why he wanted to rope Han Jue in was because of his strength. The two of them chatted for a while more. After that, Han Jue returned to the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 He sent a dream to Heavenly Venerate Wufa and asked why Pan Xin was looking for him.
  “What else could it be? He just wants to rope me in. With his sudden increase in cultivation, he’s scheming like a child. I casually dealt with him and he left happily.”
 Heavenly Venerate Wufa was rather disdainful of Pan Xin.
 Although he was not his match, he was also a Freedom Sage, so he could look at Pan Xin at the same level.
 Han Jue removed the dream and returned to reality.
 Updates by
 He then visited Qiu Xilai and Sect Master Tian Jue in their dreams. His instructions were the same. If Pan Xin continued to look for them, there was no need to reject him directly.
 After making the arrangements, Han Jue first looked at Xing Hongxuan. The fetus in her womb was still being nurtured. Its vitality had already surpassed ordinary immortals. Xing Hongxuan’s cultivation level had also been increasing. The mother and son were supporting each other.
 Han Jue looked forward to his youngest son.
 In the dream.
 Han Tuo suddenly opened his eyes and saw Han Jue.
 He couldn’t help but be in a daze.
 All along, every time Han Jue appeared, he was covered by divine light. He only appeared in his true appearance in the past ten thousand years. Han Tuo hurriedly stood up and bowed to greet his father.
 He seemed very restrained. After all, he had only interacted with his father for twenty years. To him, who was more than a hundred thousand years old, that memory was too short. It was so short that it was almost blurry. Han Jue looked at his son who was already on his own and couldn’t help but sigh.
 Compared to the last time they met, Han Tuo’s aura was even stronger. He was not weaker than the Divine General and the Heavenly God General at all. In fact, his attitude was even stronger.
 Such a calm temperament must have experienced countless storms.
 Hearing this, Han Tuo revealed an excited expression. “It’s all thanks to Your Majesty’s care. Of course, the reason why Your Majesty took care of me is also because of you.” He knew his limits. The Evil Heavenly Emperor treated him well, but he always treated him as Han Jue.
 He even suspected the relationship between the Evil Heavenly Emperor and Han Jue. ‘”‘I came to see you today and teach you a Mystical Power.”
 Han Jue smiled. He didn’t pretend to be cold in front of his son.
 Han Tuo became even more excited.
 Han Jue didn’t say anything else and began to pass on the Mystical Power.
 Han Jue thought silently and his eyes became firm.
 Even so, he had already taken good care of the people around him. At least his disciples were still alive and had even obtained achievements and status that they couldn’t have obtained otherwise. Han Jue began to check his emails. His mentality changed and returned to normal. How could mighty figures be tied down by emotions and desires?
 After reading the emails with relish, Han Jue continued to cultivate in seclusion.
 “Today, I, Pan Xin, will use my Dao Fruit to open the Chaotic Heavenly Road and connect the Heavenly Dao to the Chaos. The living beings of the Heavenly Dao can enter the Chaotic Heavenly Road and head to the Chaos. On the Heavenly Road, you can obtain the protection of the Heavenly Dao!” Pan Xin’s voice suddenly resounded in the Heavenly Dao.
 Everyone was in an uproar!
 The Sages were also shocked.
 A vast heavenly might enveloped the Immortal World. At the same time, in the east, the Heavenly Dao’s providence transformed into a golden rain that scattered down. It quickly condensed into a golden path that extended from the edge of the eastern realm of the Immortal World to the depths of the chaos at an extremely fast speed.
 The living beings in the nearby Chaotic City were shocked.
  “That’s the Chaotic Heavenly Road?”
 “What a huge Heavenly Dao providence. Is this a Sage?”
 Pan Xin was not an ancient Sage and did not have a providence sect. All living beings were not familiar with him, so they maintained a suspicious attitude. Han Jue didn’t care when he heard this and continued cultivating. Pan Xin wouldn’t betray the Heavenly Dao. At most, he would scheme against other Sages.
 Just the Chaotic Heavenly Road could not take down the other Sages. It wasn’t until the five thousand years ended that Han Jue opened his eyes again. His cultivation level had increased greatly again!
