 The vast years were like a flowing river, never to return.
 Unknowingly, Han Jue’s age had reached 240 million years old. His cultivation level had increased again.
 This feeling was really good.
 Han Jue habitually checked his emails.
 [Your good friend Zhao Shuangquan was cursed by a mysterious curse.]
 [Your enemy, the Ninth Chaos’ soul fragment, has suffered damage to his cultivation.]
 [Your son Han Huang has absorbed the Supreme Rules and his cultivation has increased greatly.]
 [Your disciple Ji Xianshen is lost in the River of Space-Time.]
 [Your good friend, the Formless Transcendent Deity, was attacked by a transcendent
 existence.]
 [Your good friend Huang Zuntian has absorbed the nebulous Primordial Qi and his soul has begun to transform.]
 [Your good friend Chaotic Consciousness has created a Great Creation. His providence has increased greatly.]
 …
 These years were not as chaotic as before.
 The Chaos began to rest after experiencing the calamity of the Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devils. Han Jue seemed to have returned to the time when the Heavenly Dao restarted.
 Han Jue patiently checked his emails.
 Then, he looked outside the Daoist temple.
 Some disciples left the Dao Field. To them, listening to Han Jue’s lecture was worth it.
 The Nine Divine Stars and Shan’e were cultivating in the Daoist temple. Han Jue was very satisfied with their attitude.
 The Ultimate Origin World was temporarily safe. Even if the Dao Creators saw the Ultimate Origin World’s potential, it was still far inferior to the Chaos, and it was close to the Chaos.
 The Ultimate Origin World’s fate would definitely be the same as the
 Consciousnessless, Transcendent, and Shi Tian
 worlds as long as it collided with the Chaos.
 Han Jue shifted his gaze to the Chaos.
 He suddenly raised his eyebrows.
 Dark Forbidden Lord…
 Countless Dark Forbidden Lords actually
 appeared in the Chaos. There were also many
 factions claiming to be the Dark Forbidden Lord. The Heavenly Dao Darkness Sect that had disappeared back then also reappeared.
 What happened?
 Han Jue began to deduce, and his expression became strange.
 It was actually the Nine Extremes Orthodoxy…
 Zhao Shuangquan, who had reincarnated the Eighth Chaos’ memories, Yu Yuan, who had inherited the first Chaotic Will, and the Nine-Headed Divine Spirit actually declared that they believed in the Dark Forbidden Lord and even wantonly beautified him as if he was
 a savior.
 Han Jue was dumbfounded.
 What kind of method was this? What kind of
 idea was this?
 He deduced seriously, and the more he
 deduced, the stranger his expression became.
 They actually want to use the Dark Forbidden
 Lord to resist me?
 How arrogant.
 Zhao Shuangquan still had a good impression
 of him, but he was already prepared to guard against him.
 Could it be that he thought Han Jue would make a move if he fought Han Huang to death? Han Jue put himself in Zhao Shuangquan’s shoes. He indeed had to be wary of this level. If it were him, he wouldn’t place his hopes on the other party not fighting with the juniors.
 However, the Ninth Chaos did not instruct Zhao Shuangquan. Was he most afraid of the Dark Forbidden Lord now?
 Han Jue had no intention of interfering. He
 naturally wouldn’t stop them from beautifying
 him.
 Zhao Shuangquan would have wasted his efforts as long as he ignored him.
 Han Jue looked at the Creation Emperor Court of the Transcendent Domain. Han Huang and Han Ling had also been very well-behaved during this period of time, especially Han Huang. He was probably too stimulated by the
 Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil.
 In addition, the Formless Transcendent Deity
 to Han Jue.
 He observed Han Huang.
 This kid was already a unique existence below
 The creation and construction of the Great Dao World took a long time. This was also why there were only five Dao Creators since ancient
 times. Han Jue was different. His system was the greatest creation. His Great Dao World had begun to take form a long time ago, and his
 physique far exceeded the Primordial Fiendcelestial.
 “I wonder when the next Dao Creator will
 appear and who it will be.”
 Han Jue thought curiously. He didn’t use the system’s derivation function.
 It was more interesting to leave some
 unknowns.
 A new Dao Creator could not threaten him.
 After that, Han Jue closed his eyes and continued his seclusion.
 He wanted to see if he could reach the perfected Dao Creator Realm before turning 300 million years old.
 In a vast world.
 The sky was like jade. The undulating mountains formed a natural chasm in the sky. On the top of a huge peak sat a Dao Palace. A
 plaque hung on the door with three words printed on it.
 Purple Firmament Palace!
 Thousands of cultivators in Daoist robes
 meditated in the palace, facing the same direction.
 Hong Jun sat at the head of the table. He had
 white hair and an indifferent expression. His entire body emitted an extraordinary aura. A Daoist asked, “Teacher, now that the Great
 Dao Immeasurable Calamity is about to descend, the Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devils slaughtered countless people in the Chaos previously. It’s already a calamity. What’s the true Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity?”
 All the Dao Seekers in Purple Firmament Palace looked at Hong Jun.
 Hong Jun was the Dao Ancestor’s reincarnation, and he had preached the Dao for a hundred million years. He was already famous. In the eyes of these Dao Seekers, Hong Jun was already a Chaos expert who had
 attained the Dao and stood at the peak. Hong Jun replied, “The Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity can’t be predicted, but it will definitely be the most difficult calamity ever. You should be thinking about when it will
 descend. That will only increase your worries.”
 “With our potential, how many years will it take us to catch up to the Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devil?” “The entire Chaos was almost destroyed. What can we do?”
 “In the Chaos, the Nine Extremes Orthodoxy, the Creation Emperor Court, the Northern Chaos, and the Dao Addled Sect are the strongest. However, it’s very difficult for us to join them.”
 “Sigh. I suddenly feel that cultivation is meaningless. We can’t change anything.” “No, no. Fellow Daoists, you still have to have
 faith. You might not be able to do it alone, but
 what if there are ten thousand, a million, or even billions?”
 Hong Jun did not interrupt their discussion.
 After a long time, after all the Dao Seekers lost interest, the Purple Firmament Palace quietened down. Their gazes landed on Hong Jun again.
 They could only rely on this person in front of them. Those legendary Chaotic mighty figures were too far away from them.
 Hong Jun said slowly, “I’ve experienced several
 Great Dao Immeasurable Calamities. Although this Immeasurable Calamity will be far greater than before, don’t worry, I’ll take action. All of you can cultivate well in the Purple Firmament Palace. There might be a chance.”
 The Dao Seekers looked at each other. Many of
 them smiled. This was the guarantee of Hong Jun’s protection.
 A clap sounded at this moment. All the Dao Seekers turned around and saw a
 figure walking through the door of the Purple Firmament Palace. This figure was extremely majestic and had disheveled hair. He emitted a great power as he walked.
 Hong Jun narrowed his eyes and asked, “Why
 are you here?”
 He was Pangu!
 Hong Jun narrowed his eyes and said, “All of
 you, leave. I have something to talk about with
 this old friend.”


 The disciples of Purple Firmament Palace were evacuated, leaving only Pangu and Hong Jun.
 The Heavenly Dao’s founder and the Heavenly Dao’s strengthener met. The atmosphere was subtle.
 Pangu stopped less than a hundred feet away and said, “You should know why I’m here.”
 Hong Jun said, “I know what you want, but that thing is not in my possession. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have left the Heavenly Dao.”
 Pangu stared at him. “What about the Jade Slip of Creation? It must have absorbed the Heavenly Dao’s Transcendent Rule. It’s precisely because there is no Transcendent Rule that the Heavenly Dao has intelligence. The only one who can snatch it is you.”
 Hong Jun shook his head. “The Chaos invaded the Heavenly Dao many times during my Dao Integration. The Heavenly Dao was damaged several times. My cultivation level in the past was insufficient and I didn’t know about the Transcendent Rule.”
 Hong Jun was fearless.
 Killing intent began to fill the Purple Firmament Palace. Even the swaying
 candlelight stopped moving. The atmosphere was oppressive.
 Hong Jun said, “It’s not feasible to walk the path of the Great Dao World after attaining creation. Transcendent, Consciousnessless, and Shi Tian have already been devoured by the Chaos. We should think of another way.”
 Pangu asked, “What other way?”
 Hong Jun stared at him and said, “Snatching the karma of the calamity and creating the Chaos’ creation.”
 Pangu frowned.
 “We have always fought for the present and rules, but there are not only rules in the world, nor are there only the present,” Hong Jun said slowly.
 He stood up and said, “Pangu, you are the Heavenly Dao’s ancestor and I am the Heavenly Dao’s Dao Ancestor. We will have a chance of survival if we join forces. I will be killed by the Dao Creator once I appear in my true body. It’s useless even if I take your Transcendent Rule.”
 Pangu asked, “You want to walk the path of the Chaos?”
 Hong Jun said, “No. Compared to the Primordial Chaos, the Chaos is about the perfection of rules. If we want to replace the
 “We can absorb the Chaos’ providence and
 create a new creation if we can create a race that unites everything and overturn everything with the Chaos’ creation. The Chaos can’t stop
 it even if it wants to.”
 Hong Jun’s words were powerful, causing
 Pangu’s brows to gradually spread.
 Pangu asked, “If that’s the case, how can the
 Chaos let this race grow up?”
 Hong Jun said, “I’m looking for a Supreme Treasure that can change karma and providence. We’ll make this race pretend to be
 unstoppable before revealing its true identity. All these years, my soul has been scattered everywhere looking for this treasure.
 “I will continue to search, while you inspect the Heavenly Dao Race. Choose one.” Pangu thought for a moment and nodded in agreement.
 Hong Jun looked at him and saw the deep meaning in each other’s eyes.
 …
 Ten million years later.
 Han Jue, who was now 250 million years old,
 opened his eyes. He suddenly disappeared and his main body appeared in the Ultimate Origin
 World.
 The Ultimate Origin World had been expanding. As it became stronger, it flew faster and faster towards the Chaos. The pressure of
 the Chaos on the Great Dao World was too
 strong, but luckily, the Ultimate Origin World was sufficiently far away.
 Not to mention the Ultimate Origin World, even
 the Purity Great Dao World was some time away from colliding with the Chaos.
 Han Jue stood at the peak of the Ultimate Origin World and looked down.
 The Seven Supreme Rules were above the three
 thousand Great Dao of Ultimate Origin. Under
 Han Jue’s gaze, a new Supreme Rule was about to be born.
 There were only seven Supreme Rules in each Great Dao World. Karma, Providence, Slaughter, Creation, Destiny, Reincarnation, and Space-Time. Perhaps there were differences, but they were probably the same, especially Karma, Providence, and Creation. These three Supreme Rules were the core.
 Han Jue was curious about what the Ultimate
 Origin World’s eighth Supreme Rule was going to be.
 This new Supreme Rule was already about to be born before he appeared, so he did not have to wait long.
 The eighth Supreme Rule was actually the
 Devour Rule. It was very similar to Han Jue’s Great Dao of Devour but was even more advanced.
 The Ultimate Origin World could devour other
 Great Dao Worlds with this Supreme Rule! Could it be that one of the Supreme Rules of
 the Chaos was devouring, so it could devour those Great Dao Worlds? Didn’t this mean that the Ultimate Origin
 World was about to catch up to the Chaos?
 However, the Ultimate Origin World was still approaching the Chaos, which meant that its power was stronger. Otherwise, it would be the Chaos approaching the Ultimate Origin World. Han Jue watched for a while. He left after the eighth Supreme Rule stabilized.
 He did not return to the Dao Field. Instead, he wandered in the blank domain.
 After leaving the blank domain, he stopped and said, “Show yourself.”
 With that, a figure appeared behind him.
 Han Jue looked over. It was a figure he had
 never seen before.
 Dao Creator!
 Could it be the most mysterious Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity?
 Han Jue immediately used the simulation trial
 test.
 [Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity: Mid-stage Dao Creator, Chaotic Deity, Blank Guardian, Ancestor of Terror, transcends the Chaos and
 exists in eternal space-time.]
 Indeed, it’s him!
 Han Jue asked, “What do you want?”
 The Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity was surrounded by black and white Qi. The Qi turned into mist, and his body looked very small, but his aura was very strong.
 “I want to see how strong you, a junior, are. You’re so strong that that existence thinks you’re second.” The Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity snorted.
 Second place? This was killing him with flattery! Han Jue asked, “I naturally can’t be second.
 Who said that?”
 Want a curse?
 “Ninth Chaos!”
 The Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity smiled. His tone was a little strange.
 Han Jue remained silent.
 That was not flattery, but instigation! Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity: “Find a place to
 spar?”
 The aftermath of a Dao Creator-level fight would be terrifying. It would definitely affect
 the Chaos and the other Great Dao Worlds. Han Jue said, “Lead the way.” In any case, he had already split his will. He
 could revive even if he died.
 Dao Creators could only spar and not kill each
 other.
 Perhaps after Han Jue became a Creator Lord,
 he could decide the life and death of Dao
 Creators.
 The Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity turned
 around and left. Han Jue followed closely behind.
 Just as they left, the Chaotic Consciousness, the Formless Transcendent Deity, and the Immeasurable Destruction Venerable appeared.
 “Tsk tsk, they are indeed going to fight.”
 “Who will win?”
 “It’s hard to say. Purity Nirvana is always in seclusion. He fought against the Chaos back then. He must be stronger now.”
 “Indeed, his aura shocked me.” “However, the Divine Might Heavenly Sage is not simple either. His aura is ethereal no matter when we look at him. He doesn’t look
 strong,
 but we can’t see through him. This means that the difference between us is extremely great.”
 The three Dao Creators began to discuss. They
 weren’t sure who would win.


 Han Jue entered the depths of the blank domain under Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity’s lead. This place was far from the Chaos, the Ultimate Origin World, and the Purity Great Dao World. Even if the Dao Creators fought here, the other waves would find it very difficult to threaten the various Great Dao Worlds. It was really too far. It would take tens of thousands of years for a Great Dao Supreme to rush over.
 Han Jue activated all his Supreme Treasures and distanced himself from the Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity.
 He agreed to this battle to intimidate the Ninth Chaos.
 Recently, many Chaotic spies had appeared in the Ultimate Origin World, including cultivators from the Nine Extremes Orthodoxy. There had to be a conspiracy behind this.
 Although the Ultimate Origin World was inferior to the Chaos, Han Jue was not afraid of the Ninth Chaos.
 He had already reached the late-stage Dao Creator Realm and the Ninth Chaos was injured by his curse. He could still resist even if he couldn’t insta-kill him.
 In any case, the Ninth Chaos was already filled with hatred towards him. Showing his strength appropriately was also a deterrent.
 The black and white Qi around the Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity began to spread. It quickly circled around a scene of the Great Dao World, as if Chaos had descended into this pale void.
 “Let me see how powerful the second Dao Creator is!”
 The Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity smiled, his tone filled with disdain.
 This fellow was so arrogant!
 Han Jue frowned. Logically speaking, a Dao Creator shouldn’t have such a bearing. Could it be that the other party was deliberately provoking him to see what he was capable of?
 It seemed that the Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity and the Ninth Chaos were closer than he had imagined. Otherwise, the Ninth Chaos wouldn’t have let the Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity attain the mid-stage Dao Creator Realm. Han Jue didn’t say anything and directly used Ultimate Origin Soul Oblivion. Seven blades of Divine Punishment appeared around him.
 The seven red blades surrounded his body. Sometimes, they grew longer, and sometimes shorter. A terrifying sharp aura surged towards Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity.
 At first glance, Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity knew that this Mystical Power was extremely piercing and could not be blocked.
 Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity’s body suddenly dissipated. The black and white mist surged violently towards Han Jue from all directions. It
 had the domineering aura of devouring the
 world and of being unstoppable.
 Han Jue’s eyes narrowed. Seven Divine Punishment Light Blades suddenly swept in all directions. Their speed was so fast that countless afterimages could be seen. It was as if they split into billions of light blades and forcefully dispersed the black and white mist. The black and white mist that covered nearly half of the blank domain was instantly dispersed, leaving only a trace of remnant Qi.
 Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity suddenly appeared behind Han Jue. A hand covered in strange Dao patterns stretched out. In an instant, a black and white vortex appeared behind Han Jue, as if space was distorted and wanted to disperse his body.
 Swish!
 A Divine Punishment Light Blade attacked and tore apart the Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity and the black and white vortex.
 Han Jue couldn’t be bothered to turn around.
 He was invincible once the Ultimate Origin Soul Oblivion was activated.
 The Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity kept
 moving and appearing. Every time he appeared, he would be found by the Ultimate Origin Soul Oblivion and destroyed time and time again. However, he persevered and tried his best to find a flaw.
 This scene shocked the three Dao Creators in
 the distance.
 “What Mystical Power is that?”
 “It’s not as simple as speed. The enemy will immediately be attacked when they appear. It feels like karma.”
 “The Divine Might Heavenly Sage’s Mystical Power is very strong. I’m inferior.”
 Han Jue and the Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity
 knew about the three Dao Creators watching the battle, but they didn’t care.
 Since the Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity dared
 As for Han Jue, he felt that he wouldn’t lose. The Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity appeared again. He spread his arms, and black and white Qi surged out. Han Jue’s vision instantly turned black and white. When the black and white
 became clear and various colors surged into his vision, he was pulled into the cycle of reincarnation.
 The experiences of reincarnation appeared in front of him. He was like a spectator watching himself undergo reincarnation. Han Jue snorted. “Child’s play!”
 With that, the cycle of reincarnation shattered
 and his vision returned to a blank domain. The Yin-Yang Void Destruction Deity appeared in front of him. He held a bone staff in his left hand as he forcefully blocked the Ultimate Origin Soul Oblivion. He formed a seal with his
 right hand. The square shape had the profundity of the Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal as it collided with Han Jue.
 This time, the Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity
 succeeded.
 Han Jue was struck by the mysterious seal. His soul suffered an impact and was forcefully forced out of his body.
 Han Jue looked over. His body was a thousand
 feet away. “What a domineering Mystical Power. Even I, a late-stage Dao Creator, can’t resist it.”
 Han Jue thought in surprise.
 However, this was the only thing impressive about it. Even if his soul and body were separated, the Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity
 could not withstand the Ultimate Origin Soul Oblivion.
 The mysterious bone staff blocked the Ultimate
 Origin Heaven Seal once and was scattered the second time.
 Han Jue smiled as his soul shrank into his
 body. The Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity split into countless clones that covered a radius of billions of kilometers. There were countless of them, and they all attacked Han Jue.
 Seven Divine Punishment Light Blades swept
 back and forth, destroying one Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity after another.
 At this moment, a Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana
 Deity in the distance raised his arms and shook the Dharmic powers in his body. He actually tore a hole in the blank domain. This hole was
 black, and strange white lightning interwove within.
 Spatial power!
 This spatial crack was not torn apart by the
 blank domain, but an alternate space had descended into it.
 Han Jue saw the truth at a glance. He was about
 to attack when the hole suddenly expanded and quickly devoured him.
 Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity and Han Jue fell into the endless spatial vortex at the same time. Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity was still constantly attacking him. He still persevered even though he was destroyed by the Ultimate Origin Soul Oblivion countless times.
 Han Jue relied on his Supreme Treasures and the Ultimate Origin Soul Oblivion and was not injured at all. On the other hand, the Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity had already been destroyed tens of millions of times, but he was not affected because he was a Dao Creator. The surrounding space reversed and a spatial torrent appeared above Han Jue’s head. Billions of stars entered his eyes.
 In an instant, Han Jue suddenly landed on a
 piece of land. The galaxy hung upside down in
 the sky and the ground under his feet was endlessly barren.
 Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity descended at the end of the horizon. With a wave of his sleeve, black and white Qi condensed into a terrifying beam of light that shot over. The mountains along the way shattered and the ground was severed.
 A Divine Punishment Light Blade dispersed the black and white light. Yin-Yang Void Destruction Deity appeared above Han Jue’s
 head.
 Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity raised his right hand. Countless stars of different sizes appeared in his palm. He threw them down. The stars suddenly expanded the moment his body was destroyed by the Ultimate Origin
 Soul, as if countless real stars were raining down. Some were a hundred million times larger than the sun, dense and mighty. Han Jue looked up, and two sword Qi shot out
 from his eyes. The sword Qi soared into the sky. In an instant, countless sword Qi interwove in this strange world, slicing the terrifying starry rain into dust.
 The ground under Han Jue’s feet collapsed at
 this moment. The soil and rocks dissipated like smoke. Endless magma appeared below. Scorching air rose and burned until space distorted and collapsed. A mysterious suction force pulled him down.


 The suction force in the endless magma was very strong. Ordinary Dao Creators might not be able to block it, but it was like the power of a child to Han Jue. He remained calm and didn’t move. His gaze landed on the constantly destroyed and reborn Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity.
 “Is that all you’re capable of?” Han Jue asked. As soon as he finished speaking, this strange world shattered like a mirror and endless darkness attacked.
 Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity appeared again and continued to cast spells, pulling Han Jue into the River of Destiny.
 The endless River of Destiny occupied the
 entire dark void. Han Jue looked at the River of
 Destiny as he resisted Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity’s attack.
 He saw the reincarnation of his children and disciples, saw those old friends who had already died still struggling in the mortal world. He even saw his future friends turn against each other and fight to the death.
 Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity followed the River of Destiny and attacked. Countless Dharmic powers arrows broke through the water surface and shot at Han Jue. The arrows were long and each carried a spatial line. The monstrous providence in a spatial line condensed on their arrows, causing them all to erupt with terrifying power.
 Han Jue’s eyes narrowed. The Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal suddenly appeared and blocked all the arrows.
 The Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity had just been reborn when the Ultimate Origin Soul Oblivion was pulled over by a terrifying suction force. His soul and body were directly stuck to it. An invisible force sealed him, making him unable to move.
 “How can this be?!”
 The Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity was
 shocked. He wanted to kill his body and revive, but he could not. His soul and Dharmic powers were all imprisoned.
 He looked at Han Jue in disbelief.
 Han Jue walked over on the endless and
 majestic River of Destiny. The Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity was a little stunned by his figure.
 In a daze, the Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity recalled the scene when he challenged the Ninth Chaos.
 It was the same then. No matter how many times he was reborn, he could not hurt the Ninth Chaos and was finally suppressed. However, that was because he had yet to break through. Now that he had already surpassed the Dao Creator and taken a huge step forward, he thought he would be calm even if he faced the Ninth Chaos again. However, reality gave him a warning.
 Han Jue’s strength made him feel helpless.
 From the battle until now, only dozens of breaths of time had passed for mortals, but he had already died hundreds of millions of times. If not for the fact that the Dao Creator would not die, he would not be Han Jue’s match at all. Was this the strength of the second-strongest Dao Creator?
 The Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity gritted his teeth and struggled with all his might. Han Jue was expressionless. The divine light emitted by the Supreme Treasure on his body covered his face. Even the Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity couldn’t see his expression.
 “Is it just a spar?” Han Jue’s voice sounded softly, but it was filled with endless killing intent.
 He wanted to force the Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity to bow his head.
 The Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity was angry. “What? You want to kill me? Do you have the
 ability?”
 Han Jue raised his right hand, and the eighth Divine Punishment Light Blade appeared. The previous Seven Great Divine Punishment Light Blades represented the Seven Supreme Rules of the Ultimate Origin World. Now that the Eighth Supreme Rule had been born, his Ultimate Origin Soul Oblivion also gave birth to a new power.
 Devouring power!
 Han Jue said, “I can’t kill you, but I can devour your Great Dao World and your Transcendent Rule, making you my slave forever.”
 The Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity panicked.
 The Ninth Chaos treated the other three Dao Creators like this. The reason why he survived was that he had begged the Ninth Chaos for
 mercy.
 He was like an ant begging the heavens for
 mercy.
 It was a humiliation buried deep in the Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity’s heart. Even the other three Dao Creators did not know
 about this.
 A Dao Creator was actually so shameless.
 The Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity was furious
 as he recalled that traumatic scene.
 He couldn’t do it a second time! The furious Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity
 emitted a terrifying aura. The black and white Qi actually transformed into a scarlet murderous aura. His black and white body also turned blood red.
 It seemed like he was about to explode. Han Jue felt bored and couldn’t be bothered to
 delay. Eight Divine Punishment Light Blades attacked the Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity nailed to the
 Ultimate Origin Heaven Seal.
 Boom-
 The Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity was instantly dispersed and his body and soul were destroyed. The eight Divine Punishment Light Blades did not continue to move. Instead, they emitted a seven-colored light and condensed the Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity’s soul in the Divine Punishment Light Blade. Then, it ate and devoured it.
 Blank Domain.
 The Chaotic Consciousness, the Formless Transcendent Deity, and the Immeasurable Destruction Venerable looked at Han Jue walking over with mixed emotions.
 Han Jue seemed to be strolling in the
 courtyard, but every step was very fast. He arrived in front of them in a few steps. “Where’s the Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity?” the Chaotic Consciousness asked.
 Han Jue said, “Fellow Daoist Yin-Yang sparred
 with me to a draw and left.” They were on par?
 The three Dao Creators almost lost their
 The battle between the two Dao Creators was
 like a Sage fighting a mortal. Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity couldn’t hurt Han Jue no matter what he did.
 The difference…
 They felt despair just from the Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity’s perspective.
 The Immeasurable Destruction Venerable couldn’t help but ask, “What happened just
 now? Is the Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity dead?”
 The Chaotic Consciousness said firmly, “Impossible. A Dao Creator won’t die. There’s only one possibility. He escaped and doesn’t dare to pester anymore.”
 The Formless Transcendent Deity nodded.
 They could live until today because of the Dao Creator’s indestructible trait.
 …
 Third Dao Field. The Nine Divine Stars and Shan’e were chased
 out of the Daoist temple. They didn’t have any
 Han Jue sat on the lotus throne and silently used the Ultimate Origin Heavenly Prison. In front of him stood a Divine Punishment
 Light Blade, which contained the Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity’s will. The Devour Supreme Rule was actually so
 powerful. No wonder the Ninth Chaos could subdue other Dao Creators.
 This Supreme Rule should not be as simple as devouring. It was only because it seemed to devour the Great Dao that Han Jue gave it such
 a name.
 This Supreme Rule would be born naturally in
 the Great Dao World after one reached the
 late-stage Dao Creator Realm. It was really powerful.
 After being trapped by the Devour Supreme Power, although the Dao Creator would not die, his consciousness would not be able to escape. His connection with his other clones and will was even severed.
 This gave Han Jue a chance to use the Ultimate Origin Heavenly Prison!
 “Can the mid-stage Dao Creator be enslaved by
 the Ultimate Origin Heavenly Prison?” Han Jue asked in his mind.
 [Yes, but it will take a long time.] Han Jue’s eyes lit up. Fortunately, he had
 upgraded the Primordial Heavenly Prison back then. Otherwise, it might still be useless
 against a Dao Creator.
 As for how long it would take, Han Jue didn’t care at all.
 What he did not lack the most was time!
 [The Ninth Chaos sent you a dream. Do you accept?]
 A notification suddenly appeared in front of
 him.


 Han Jue hesitated.
 He knew what the Ninth Chaos was here for.
 “Can I subdue the Ninth Chaos like I subdued the Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity?” Han Jue asked silently.
 [50 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 !!
 Continue!
 [No]
 “Can I defeat the Ninth Chaos?”
 [50 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [Yes]
 Han Jue was not surprised. He had already thought so. He wanted to confirm it just to be
 sure.
 [The Ninth Chaos sent you a dream. Do you want to continue?]
 Again!
 Han Jue hesitated for a moment but still chose to accept it.
 The dream was a blank domain.
 Han Jue saw the Ninth Chaos. It was still so mysterious and didn’t seem to be affected by the curse or mental demons.
 The Ninth Chaos asked, “Where’s the Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity? Let him go.”
 Han Jue said, “I sparred with him and we felt like old friends at first sight. I invited him to my Dao Field as a guest.
 Barge into my Dao Field if you have the ability!
 He believed that the Ninth Chaos had once thought of barging into the Dao Field, but he failed.
 “Then let him out first. I have something to tell him,” Ninth Chaos said forcefully.
 Han Jue said, “No, we’ll talk about it after some time.”
 The dream fell silent.
 Han Jue could feel the Ninth Chaos’ aura fluctuating. It seemed that the mental demon’s appearance caused him to no longer be as calm as before.
 Han Jue wasn’t in a hurry and let the Ninth Chaos steam.
 In terms of pressure, the Ninth Chaos should be the greatest, because he was about to lose his authority.
 The dream shattered.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and his expression
 became subtle.
 It seemed that the Ninth Chaos had not lost his
 mind.
 The Ninth Chaos was probably waiting for the Endless Era to arrive before forcefully
 Han Jue couldn’t deal with him, either. He
 couldn’t kill the Ninth Chaos or even suppress
 Their battle would be endless. They still had to be wary of each other and couldn’t even
 cultivate in peace.
 The current situation was the best choice for
 both sides.
 Next, it depended on who broke through
 earlier.
 Han Jue slowly closed his eyes and continued
 cultivating.
 As for the Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity, he was still sealed in the Ultimate Origin Soul Oblivion waiting to be enslaved.
 A huge crimson star landed in the lonely void. A mysterious red mist filled the surroundings.
 In the star.
 The ground was barren, but it was dotted with lakes of different sizes. The lake’s surface was frozen, contrasting with the seemingly scorching ground.
 A naked human youth landed on all fours like a
 monkey. He only had a trouser dress made of beast skin tied around his waist. His hair was disheveled and his face was dirty. His eyes were murky like dust.
 The human youth looked extremely tiny under the sky, like an ant wandering aimlessly, lonely
 and desolate.
 After an unknown period of time.
 The human youth was tired. He stopped at the
 edge of a small lake and began to lick the
 frozen surface with his tongue. Soon, his tongue stuck to the ice and he subconsciously retracted it. Blood surged from the wound that formed and he rolled back in pain.
 The blood landed on the ice and burned a huge hole. Immediately after, the entire surface of
 the lake began to melt.
 Mist rose.
 The human youth did not notice this scene. He
 was covering his mouth and rolling on the ground in pain.
 After the pain subsided, he slowly turned around. However, the scene in front of him left him stunned.
 The surface of the lake was shimmering. A
 refreshing breeze blew over, making him feel refreshed.
 The human youth immediately rushed over and
 sprawled in the river by the lake. He wolfed down the food until his hair was wet.
 At this moment, a voice sounded, “You came
 by foot. What do you want?”
 The human youth suddenly looked up and saw
 a white-haired old man standing at the side, stroking his beard and smiling.
 It was the leader of the Nether Race, Han You.
 The human youth squeaked and danced excitedly.
 Han You smiled and asked, “You want to seek
 the Dao? You want to fly into the sky and enter
 the ground?”
 The human youth nodded desperately. Han You sized him up and sighed. “I didn’t
 expect an existence like you to be born in the Ultimate Origin World. I’ll give you the title of Human Race Ancestor.” Human Ancestor?
 The human youth did not understand, but he felt that it was a good thing and was even happier. He began to circle around Han You. Sometimes, he scratched his ears and cheeks, and sometimes, he pulled his pants and belt. Han You waved his sleeve, and a beam of light surged into the human youth’s forehead. The human youth froze.
 He returned to his senses after a long time. He
 looked at Han You and asked, “Are you very
 powerful? Can you fly and break through the ground?” Clearly, he had seen how powerful the cultivators of the Ultimate Origin World were.
 Han You smiled. “Of course, I can. I can teach
 you.”
 “Really?”
 “You can be considered determined to have
 walked here, but I hope that you can seriously consider the meaning of your existence during your cultivation,” Han You said seriously. The human youth seemed to understand. Han You sighed upon seeing how simple he
 was.
 This was the first person in the Ultimate Origin World.
 In the Heavenly Dao, the Human Race was
 fabricated by Nüwa, but this youth was a natural product of the Ultimate Origin World. The human youth had no parents. He was born at the bottom of a lake and had absorbed millions of years of Heaven and Earth Spirit Qi. His body was different from ordinary people, but he did not know how to use his Dharmic powers at all.
 Han You held the human youth’s hand and walked into the distance. “From now on, your name is Jue Yi.”
 “Alright, alright. I have a name too.”
 “Call me Master from now on.” “Master!” “Good disciple.”
 “Master, where are you bringing me? How can
 I fly?”
 “You’ll know in the future.”
 …
 Ten million years later. Han Jue opened his eyes and looked at the
 Ultimate Origin Soul Oblivion in front of him.
 The Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity had yet to be successfully enslaved. As expected of a
 mid-stage Dao Creator.
 However, he could wait no matter how long it took.
 Han Jue started to check his emails.
 through space and time and the River of Destiny, absorbing the power of space and time, never returning to the Chaos.
 Ji Xianshen had fallen in the past and future. He had once challenged Laozi’s past self, but the present Laozi had crossed space and time and almost killed him.
 As for why he didn’t kill him, it was probably
 because of Han Jue. From now on, Ji Xianshen didn’t dare to do anything in the past. At most, he would go and absorb power. As for the future, Ji Xianshen did not dare to
 act recklessly.
 Han Jue was still looking forward to Ji Xianshen’s experience.
 He also wanted to see if there was an example
 of his disciples relying on themselves to rise.
 Although the Spirit Qi in the Dao Field was very abundant, cultivation had to rely on one’s own creation after reaching the Great Dao Sage Realm. It was not something that could be achieved through bitter cultivation. Han Jue sensed Ji Xianshen’s Dharmic powers and saw that he was almost catching up to Dao
 Sovereign.
