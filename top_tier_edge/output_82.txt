 “What’s that?”
 “That terrifying aura. I’ve been born since the creation of the Chaos. I’ve never seen such an existence!”
 “Heavenly Sage, what should we do?”
 “I didn’t expect the world below the Chaos to attack so quickly.”
 Hearing the surrounding discussions, the Ultimate God of Punishment’s expression was also extremely ugly. No one would be in a good mood after being played.
 He looked at Han Jue.
 Han Jue said, “Your main body will continue to protect the geniuses. There’s no need to alarm them.”
 The Ultimate God of Punishment nodded.
 Han Jue suddenly raised his palm and struck. Divine Might Great Heaven Palm. This palm looked light, but as his arm straightened, the array formation that enveloped Ten Absolute City shattered. Endless wind swept in all directions.
 Outside Ten Absolute City.
 Azure Heaven Mystic was moved and stared at Han Jue.
 Divine Might Heavenly Sage! Azure Heaven Mystic frowned and muttered, “What’s going on…”
 The Chaotic mighty figures were shocked by Han Jue’s strength. They were overjoyed.
 They took out their Dharma treasures and prepared to protect the Supreme Rules. However, the majestic existence blocked the sky. They could not surpass him no matter how they used their Mystical Powers.
 “Divine Might Heavenly Sage, what are you doing?”
 A voice entered Han Jue’s ears.
 Chaotic Consciousness!
 Han Jue already knew that this guy would definitely lose, so he was naturally not afraid. Even if he died now, the soul fragment in the Dao Field would still revive him.
 Han Jue ignored the Chaotic Consciousness and looked at Azure Heaven Mystic.
 In an instant, Azure Heaven Mystic felt a terrifying killing intent that made his body tremble.
 “Han Jue, I’m letting you go, seeing that your cultivation is not easy. Why aren’t you leaving?!”
 From his tone, the other party seemed to be stronger than the Divine Might Heavenly Sage!
 All the living beings in the city knew Han Jue’s name.
 Han Tuo’s expression changed slightly and he frowned.
 “This voice… I think I’ve heard it somewhere before…”
 “Wait! That unknown existence?”
 Han Tuo thought of the transcendent existence that the Evil Heavenly Emperor had brought him to see a long time ago.
 His eyes widened in fear.
 Yi Tian asked, “What’s wrong?”
 Han Tuo shook his head and did not say anything. It was meaningless to say anything now. The current situation was not something he could interfere in.
 He looked up at his father.
 Father… What will you do?
 Han Jue heard the Formless Transcendent Deity’s threat. He pretended to be puzzled and asked, “Who are you? Tell me your name!”
 “My name will cause great karma to those who hear it. The Great Dao Sages and the Great Dao Supremes are all the same.”
 What a pretentious prick!
 He’s even more pretentious than me!
 Han Jue felt inferior. He felt that he was still far inferior to the senior in posturing.
 However, Han Jue had to continue acting since he had chosen!
 “All living beings call me the Divine Might Heavenly Sage. All my fellow Daoists admire me and respect me. No matter who you are, if you dare to harm the Chaos and want to harm all living beings, I, Han Jue, naturally can’t leave!”
 Han Jue’s voice resounded throughout the entire Ten Absolute City. His Supreme Treasures emitted divine light.
 So what if he was a Dao Creator!
 It was still possible to withstand the Dao Creator for a period of time with his Supreme Treasure!
 He was waiting for the Ninth Chaos to attack!
 jas
 Cheers and shouts sounded in Ten Absolute City. They were all chanting the Divine Might Heavenly Sage’s name.
 The Hidden Sect disciples felt their blood boiling as they looked at Han Jue in admiration.
 When the mighty figures heard Han Jue’s words, they heaved a sigh of relief and looked at him with admiration.
 In the past, they were afraid of Han Jue’s strength. Today, they admired his spirit and loyalty.
 At this moment, the Chaotic Consciousness’ voice entered Han Jue’s ears, “You want to be my enemy?”
 Azure Heaven Mystic was a pawn he had arranged, so he was possessed by the Number One Deity without any obstruction.
 Han Jue replied in his mind, “I’m just considering it. I didn’t expect you to use my name to swindle people everywhere and even lie to the Ultimate God. Today, you want to destroy all living beings in Ten Absolute City. Can you still tolerate my Heavenly Dao in the future?”
 The Chaotic Consciousness did not answer.
 Boom
 A world-shattering voice sounded. Azure Heaven Mystic leaped and attacked Han Jue. He held a spear shining with silver divine patterns in his left hand and swept past Ten Absolute City like a rainbow at an extremely fast speed.
 Han Jue raised his right hand and pointed with his index finger, blocking the tip of the spear.
 Azure Heaven Mystic’s eyes widened in disbelief.
 “You’re very strong, stronger than a Great Dao Supreme, and your strength has already gone above the three thousand Great Dao. But, you’re not my match.”
 Han Jue flicked his index finger. Azure Heaven Mystic passed through the clouds like a meteor and smashed through the ground at the bottom of the chaos.
 They couldn’t withstand a single blow!
 Han Jue looked at the Formless Transcendent Deity again. Even he was terrified when he saw that majestic figure.
 However, the Formless Transcendent Deity did not attack him. He stopped there, thinking about something.
 No!
 The Ninth Chaos was here!
 However, they couldn’t see it. Only the Dao Creator could!
 Otherwise, how could the Dao Creator let the enemy be noisy and destroy him with a flip of his hand?
 The Chaotic Consciousness was also silent.
 The Formless Transcendent Deity suddenly disappeared. The bottom of the Chaos no longer collapsed. Peace seemed to return to the world.
 The mighty figures looked at Han Jue. He said after discovering no aura stronger than him at the bottom of the Chaos, “Go and protect the Supreme Rules!”
 With that, the Great Dao Supremes disappeared first. The Great Dao Sages followed closely behind. Han Jue looked at the Ultimate God of Punishment and said, “Stabilize Ten Absolute City. Don’t let them walk around in case anything happens.”
 The Seven Supreme Rules were ravaged by hundreds of thousands of Destruction Authority Generals. Cracks could already be seen in the Supreme Rules.
 The Great Dao Supremes were frightened by the aura of the Destruction Authority Generals and did not dare to approach them.
 “Hurry up. The Chaos will be finished if the Supreme Rules are destroyed. Can we still live then?” the Foolish Sword Sage shouted angrily.
 He was the first to step on the Sword Dao and attack. Two Destructive Authority Generals blocked his Sword Dao.
 re
 The black pillars of light created by Azure Heaven Mystic were still flying out. There were hundreds of them guarding nearby.
 More than ten Great Dao Supremes joined forces, but they could not barge in at all. These Destruction Authority Generals were too strong!
 The Foolish Sword Sage gritted his teeth and thought of Han Jue.
 How did Han Jue feel when he faced the Divine Authority Generals?
 Damn it…
 How could he challenge Han Jue again if he couldn’t even deal with this!
 The Foolish Sword Sage roared angrily. His body transformed into the Heavenly Sword Dao. Sword light flashed and he attacked the hundreds of thousands of Destruction Authority Generals with unstoppable force.
 The ten Destruction Authority Generals turned around in unison and punched at him. Terrifying Dharmic powers gathered together and formed a stream of Dharmic powers that was even larger than the Foolish Sword Sage’s Sword Dao. It directly dispersed the Sword Dao and drowned the Foolish Sword Sage.
 The Foolish Sword Sage was destroyed in body and soul!


 It was not only the Foolish Sword Sage. Other mighty figures were killed one after another. However, these mighty figures all had life-saving methods and would not rashly die.
 Soon, the Foolish Sword Sage rushed over again. His heart was heavy as he looked at the endless Destruction Authority Generals.
 All the Great Dao Supremes fell silent and did not dare to advance.
 Now, they could only seek the Divine Might Heavenly Sage’s help.
 “I’m here.”
 A light voice sounded, causing the mighty figures to turn around and see Han Jue appear behind the Foolish Sword Sage.
 The Foolish Sword Sage turned around and was stunned for a moment before sighing.
 The Foolish Sword Sage smiled, suddenly feeling relieved.
 What’s so great about bullying us?
 Numbers are meaningless in front of the Divine Might Heavenly Sage!
 As Han Jue walked, seven blades of light condensed around him. They were long like a human body and had different forms. This was the Ultimate Origin Soul Oblivion, his strongest Mystical Power now!
 Azure Heaven Mystic shouted, “Stop! Divine Might Heavenly Sage, do you know what you’re doing?”
 Han Jue ignored him.
 “I can finally try my new Mystical Power!”
 Han Jue smiled as the Ultimate Origin Soul Oblivion immediately erupted, emitting an ear-piercing sound that made the Great Dao Supremes’ souls tremble. All the living beings in the Chaos could vaguely hear it.
 The seven blades of light attacked the hundreds of thousands of Destruction Authority Generals at an extremely fast speed. A strong light burst forth, and the sound of the blades of light piercing through bodies sounded one after another. The violent wind that stirred up forced the mighty figures to retreat. The black pillar of light was directly dispersed by the strong wind.
 Azure Heaven Mystic’s eyes widened in disbelief.
 The Destruction Authority Generals’ terrifying bodies were like paper in front of the Ultimate Origin Soul Oblivion. Their Dharmic powers were reduced to ashes when they touched the light blade.
 They couldn’t withstand a single blow!
 This was what the mighty figures felt.
 If not for the battle earlier, they would have thought that the Destruction Authority Generals were only a facade.
 Hundreds of thousands of Destruction Authority Generals roared crazily. They no longer attacked the Seven Supreme Rules but turned around and attacked Han Jue.
 However, the seven blades of light fought crazily at a speed that even the Great Dao Supremes could not understand. Flesh and blood splattered everywhere. His Dharmic powers were used until they dissipated into smoke. It was as if a vast mist rose and covered the Seven Supreme Rules, drowning the three thousand Great Dao.
 In less than two breaths of time!
 The hundreds of thousands of Destruction Authority Generals were all destroyed. Only one hand was still grabbing at Han Jue, ten thousand miles away.
 The seven blades of light returned to Han Jue’s body. They were bright and eternal, looking like the Seven Supreme Rules in the distance.
 Han Jue turned to look at Azure Heaven Mystic and asked, “What other moves do you have?”
 The Foolish Sword Sage and the other mighty figures were still in a state of shock and could not recover.
 They knew that Han Jue was strong, but they didn’t expect him to be so strong.
 It was unimaginable!
 This definitely surpassed the Great Dao Supreme Realm!
 Azure Heaven Mystic trembled. The Mystical Power he was so proud of was gone just like that.
 Azure Heaven Mystic said in a low voice, “Han Jue, you will never be able to reach that realm if you help the Chaos!”
 Han Jue said, “And I can succeed by helping the existence behind you? You’re heartless to all the living beings in the Chaos. How can you be at ease with existences that might threaten you?”
 Azure Heaven Mystic was silent.
 He knew he couldn’t convince Han Jue, but the most important thing now was those transcendent existences. Why didn’t they appear?
 At this moment, the Holy Mother of Order appeared beside Han Jue and said, “Heavenly Sage, I can repair the Supreme Rules. As for this crisis, it has been resolved.”
 Han Jue glanced at her and nodded slightly.
 The Holy Mother of Order had never appeared before, but Han Jue could trust her after she came out of the Primordial Heavenly Prison.
 From her words, the Ninth Chaos had probably contacted her.
 Han Jue mourned for the Formless Transcendent Deity and the Chaotic Consciousness.
 Immediately after, he suddenly appeared in front of Azure Heaven Mystic and struck his chest, shaking the Number One Deity’s soul out of the shell.
 Han Jue put Azure Heaven Mystic into his sleeve. As for the Number One Deity, he couldn’t be bothered to kill him because he felt that the Number One Deity was not the main body.
 The moment he disappeared, the Great Dao Supremes surrounded the Number One Deity.
 “Hehe, are those guys your Mystical Powers? Summon them again! I don’t believe there’s no end to them!”
 The Foolish Sword Sage grinned, his eyes filled with killing intent. The other mighty figures were the same.
 The Number One Deity was furious and cursed. “A bunch of worms. You dare to pretend after relying on the Divine Might Heavenly Sage?”
 Han Jue returned to Ten Absolute City and came to the courtyard where the Hidden Sect disciples were stationed. He moved Han Ling to his side.
 Han Ling was relieved to see her father. The others surrounded him and started asking questions.
 “How’s the situation?”
 “Master, what happened just now?”
 “Has the crisis been resolved?”
 “Junior Han, who was that figure just now? It was so terrifying!”
 “Father!”
 Han Jue raised his hand and gestured for them to calm down.
 Everyone shut up and stared at him.
 Han Jue gave a simple explanation. Everyone was shocked.
 Hundreds of thousands of Destruction Authority Generals that were stronger than Great Dao Sages were gone just like that?
 As for who the mastermind was, they couldn’t care less.
 Han Ling couldn’t help but think of her Emperor Soldiers…
 It seemed that she was not her father’s match even if she attained the Great Dao Supreme.
 “Oh my, the ones we were most worried about are gone just like that…”
 Lao Dan sighed, attracting everyone’s attention.
 Zhao Xuanyuan spread his hands and recounted their interactions with the Number One Deity.
 After a while.
 Guan Bubai cursed. “No wonder you’re so strong. You obtained the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority and still hid it from your brothers!”
 Zhou Fan was also indignant. He had been eliminated early and had often postured with Dao Sovereign in the past. However, their results were worlds apart in this Chaotic Assembly, causing him to not dare to speak to the latter.
 Zhou Fan’s son, the black-robed man, looked at Han Jue with glowing eyes.
 Too powerful!
 “Another prodigy has been eliminated!”
 A cry came from outside the courtyard, causing everyone to look up.
 After Dao Sovereign and Huang Zuntian, the Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial was eliminated!
 This surprised Han Jue. In the second Dao Field, the Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial had always been one of the top Fiendcelestials and could occasionally suppress Murong Qi.
 The one who eliminated the Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial was the Great Heavenly God King!
 The Great Heavenly God King floated in the sky and spread his arms. The world appeared behind him, and two terrifying powers intertwined in his body.


 Facing the Great Heavenly God King’s arrogance, Han Huang, Murong Qi, and Formless World immediately surrounded him.
 Formless World sized up the Great Heavenly God and clicked his tongue in wonder. “Your strength is an external force, right?”
 His voice was very loud, deliberately letting the spectators of Ten Absolute City hear it.
 The Great Heavenly God King said proudly, “What external force? This is my inherited power. Besides, at our level, who doesn’t have such power? It’s just that yours is inferior to mine!”
 !!
 Han Huang snorted. “What’s the point of talking to him? He hid in the beginning and is as scared as a chicken. Now that he sees the hope of winning, he’s pretending to be strong. He’s really shameful as a Ten Absolute!”
 The Great Heavenly God King was furious. He glared at him and said, “Come! Let’s see if you, Han Huang, are as powerful as me!”
 Han Huang smiled disdainfully and transformed into the Primordial Fiendcelestial. He stared at the Great Heavenly God King and said, “You’re not the only one hiding something. I’m the same!”
 Boom
 The monstrous aura erupted. The Consciousnessless Great Dao World trembled. The ground collapsed and spatial lightning suddenly attacked.
 Eighteen Dharma Idols condensed behind Han Huang, looking like the Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols.
 The eighteen Dharma Idols had different postures. Han Huang attacked the Great Heavenly God King with his might. The eighteen Dharma Idols used their Mystical Powers to attack the opponent.
 Before the two sides collided, the Great Heavenly God King was the first to be affected by the illusion Mystical Power. Everything in front of him turned into a scene of the Nine Nether. There were terrifying illusions everywhere.
 A green light flashed in the Great Heavenly God King’s eyes. With a look, he broke through the illusory Mystical Power. Rolling flames surged out from his body like a fire phoenix colliding with Han Huang.
 Formless World and Murong Qi did not sit back and watch. They quickly joined the battle.
 Seeing that the danger had been resolved, the living beings in Ten Absolute City focused on the sky again and began to discuss who would be the Eternal Peak.
 Han Jue and the Ultimate God of Punishment’s clone returned to the hall. Han Ling also followed beside him.
 In the hall.
 The mighty figures were still chatting about what had just happened.
 Those Great Dao Supremes were talking about Han Jue’s power. Their blood was boiling.
 Han Jue was waiting for the Ninth Chaos.
 It was impossible for the Chaotic Consciousness and the Formless Transcendent Deity to retreat when they saw him make a move. They were definitely restrained by an existence.
 Several hours later.
 A notification appeared in front of Han Jue.
 [The Ninth Chaos sent you a dream. Do you accept?]
 As expected.
 It’s time!
 Han Jue was still a little nervous. He didn’t know if the Ninth Chaos believed him. Although it couldn’t threaten his life, it would affect the people around him.
 He chose to accept it.
 His will entered the dream. The dream was a blank domain. He saw the Ninth Chaos. It was a black shadow. It was blurry, and he couldn’t see its true appearance.
 Han Jue was silent and didn’t speak first upon facing the Ninth Chaos. After all, he didn’t know what the other party was thinking.
 “Why did you reject the Chaotic Consciousness’s suggestion?” Ninth Chaos asked.
 Han Jue asked in surprise, “Who is the Chaotic Consciousness?”
 The Ninth Chaos said, “There’s no need to pretend in front of me. I know very well. You should know who I’m talking about. I also know that you didn’t reject him at the beginning.”
 Han Jue said helplessly, “He’s stronger than me. How can I refuse him? I seem to be the strongest in the Chaos, but I’m like an ant in front of you. Your conflict affected me. All I can do is try my best not to participate. However, I have no choice but to be his enemy if he wants to attack all the living beings in the Chaos.”
 The Ninth Chaos said, “You made a very smart choice. I naturally won’t blame you since you contributed to protecting the Chaos. I created the Chaos and all living beings. Firstly, it was to attain the Dao, and secondly, it was to satisfy the will of my predecessors. Do you know why the Chaos suppressed the Consciousnessless Great Dao World?”
 Han Jue shook his head.
 He had a guess, but he didn’t dare to say it.
 It was simple. He was afraid that the Chaos would be surpassed!
 Han Jue agreed with these words.
 But so what!
 The Great Dao World was a creation that led to a higher realm!
 The Ninth Chaos continued, “I’ve already planned to let the Great Dao World exist. This is also the reason why I don’t destroy the Consciousnessless Great Dao World and the Heavenly Dao. Otherwise, a thought from me is enough to destroy it. I plan to wait for the Chaos to evolve to another height and annex the various Great Dao Worlds. This way, I can restrain the Lord of the Great Dao World and reduce the conflict, allowing all living beings in the various worlds to fuse into one world.”
 Han Jue was secretly shocked.
 This fellow was about to break through to the Creator Lord Realm?
 Otherwise, how could the Chaos evolve?
 “The Chaotic Consciousness and the Formless Transcendent Deity have already been suppressed by me. After thinking for a hundred million years, from now on, I hope that you can supervise the Chaos and protect the Chaotic Order. What do you think?”
 Han Jue was surprised by the question. It ended just like that?
 He had thought that the Chaotic Consciousness and the Formless Transcendent Deity had perished.
 Was the Ninth Chaos so soft-hearted?
 No wonder these two dared to challenge the Chaos…
 Or perhaps these three had a relationship that he didn’t know.
 Han Jue said, “Let’s leave this burden to the Holy Mother of Order or the Ultimate God of Punishment. I’m busy cultivating and don’t have time to manage the Chaos. You should be able to see my past. I don’t care about the Hidden Sect or the Heavenly Dao. Let someone else do it for me.”
 Han Jue’s heart skipped a beat.
 After a long while…
 Han Jue nodded and didn’t thank him. The Ultimate God of Punishment was the one benefiting, after all.
 The Ninth Chaos continued, “There’s one more thing. The Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity has yet to disperse. I don’t know when it will sweep over. It might really be related to the Primordial Fiendcelestial. You have to take action if the Chaos is in trouble. I won’t take action unless the Chaos is destroyed or a higher existence takes action. However, I don’t want the Primordial Fiendcelestial to dominate the Chaos.”
 Han Jue asked in surprise, “Primordial Fiendcelestial? Who is it? What sign is there?”
 Han Jue immediately agreed.
 He felt helpless.
 It seemed that Han Huang was still not good enough.
 He was clearly a Primordial Fiendcelestial, but no one considered him the one.


 Han Jue’s consciousness returned to reality. The mighty figures in the hall were still discussing the Eternal Peak. Han Ling was the same.
 “That was close…”
 Han Jue’s expression didn’t change, but he was filled with fear.
 The Ninth Chaos said something before the dream ended. It was very terrifying!
 “Actually, in my opinion, you’re more like a Primordial Fiendcelestial. If not for you growing too quickly and all living beings ignoring that you’re a prodigy, you would actually be the prodigy most like a Primordial Fiendcelestial. In front of you, any prodigy is mediocre. Unfortunately, you’re only a Chaotic Fiendcelestial.”
 With that, Ninth Chaos removed the dream, not giving Han Jue a chance to explain.
 No matter what, this matter was settled.
 The Chaotic Consciousness and the Formless Transcendent Deity would not jump out and cause trouble again for the next hundred million years.
 Han Jue lost his expectations for this Chaotic Assembly after negotiating with the Ninth Chaos. He would still lose face even if Han Huang obtained the Eternal Peak.
 The mighty Primordial Fiendcelestial wasn’t treated as real.
 Although he survived because of this, Han Jue still felt humiliated.
 It would probably not be long before he was eliminated.
 Formless World’s sudden change caused his supporters in Ten Absolute City to curse.
 “This fellow is deliberately losing!”
 “Yes, why did it suddenly stop working?”
 “Too ridiculous. Huang Zuntian was the same.”
 “That’s normal. The two of them have a high support rate. If they lose, the banker will make a killing!”
 “I see. Han Huang is still the most straightforward.”
 “That’s right. As expected of the Heavenly Sage’s son. He’s open and aboveboard!”
 Han Jue asked in his mind, “Why did the Ninth Chaos not kill the Chaotic Consciousness and the Formless Transcendent Deity?”
 (100 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 (Dao Creator cannot kill Dao Creator.]
 Han Jue was enlightened.
 I see!
 No wonder the Chaotic Consciousness and the Formless Transcendent Deity were so daring. No wonder the Ninth Chaos was so benevolent. So they could only suppress each other and could not kill each other!
 He would return and enter seclusion after this Chaotic Assembly ended. The next time he came out of seclusion would be after attaining the Dao!
 In less than an hour.
 After losing the power of the Formless Transcendent Deity, Formless World was eliminated by the Great Heavenly God King.
 The Great Heavenly God King was extremely excited. He felt that he was invincible and fought Murong Qi and Han Huang alone.
 At this point in the battle, the Great Heavenly God King was the greatest winner. He had also been famous in the past, but the cultivators everywhere thought that he would at most be a Thousand Lord. They didn’t expect him to reach this step.
 Han Huang suddenly erupted once Formless World was eliminated.
 The eighteen Dharma Idols fused into his body, causing his body to grow taller and reach a hundred thousand feet tall. He grew eighteen arms and each held a divine weapon formed by nebulous Primordial Qi. His aura reached its peak.
 The Great Heavenly God King was shocked. “How is that possible!”
 Han Huang’s aura was stronger than ever!
 Han Huang ignored him and attacked forcefully. He waved the eighteen divine weapons and dispersed all the Mystical Powers of the Great Heavenly God King, suppressing him domineeringly.
 Murong Qi was also shocked. Han Huang’s aura was too strong. Just his aura was enough to make him not dare to approach. His Great Dao power actually instinctively trembled.
 Han Huang’s explosion caused the people in Ten Absolute City to cheer. All living beings seemed to see the appearance of an eternal
 peak.
 Facing the violent Han Huang, the Great Heavenly God King retreated step by step. He couldn’t withstand it at all. In the end, he was nailed to the ruins by Han Huang and eliminated like Huang Zuntian.
 The final battle was, Han Huang VS Murong Qi!
 Han Ling smiled. No matter who won, they were on the same side.
 All the living beings in Ten Absolute City also felt that there was no suspense. Although Murong Qi was strong, almost no one had expectations for him.
 The difference between him and Han Huang was still very great. Anyone could tell.
 Indeed!
 That day, Murong Qi was eliminated and Han Huang obtained the supreme throne of the Eternal Peak!
 The Ultimate God of Punishment’s voice resounded not only in Ten Absolute City but also throughout the Chaos!
 The entire Chaos stirred.
 “Father! Second Brother won!” Han Ling exclaimed, but Han Jue didn’t answer.
 He was still going over the Ninth Chaos’ words. He was a little dissatisfied with Han Huang.
 W
 as
 The Ultimate God of Punishment brought the geniuses back to the hall of the Ten Absolute City. The Ten Absolutes were about to be rewarded.
 Apart from the position of the Great Dao Divine Spirit, they could also obtain land and reward from the Ultimate God. The entire process took a lot of time, but the atmosphere was very lively.
 Only when it came to Han Huang did the Ultimate God of Punishment not directly reward him. This made the mighty figures even more curious about the reward.
 “Since the first Chaotic Assembly has ended, the next Chaotic Assembly will be in 50 million years!” the Ultimate God of Punishment said, causing the various factions to praise him. A hundred million years was too long. Fifty million years was just right.
 Han Jue left with the Hidden Sect disciples and quickly returned to the Heavenly Dao after the Chaotic Assembly ended. As for the disciples who still wanted to continue wandering, he didn’t forcefully bring them away.
 This Chaotic Assembly was extremely stimulating to the disciples.
 Han Jue sent all the Chaotic Fiendcelestials back to the second Dao Field and let them continue cultivating in seclusion. No one had any objections. They were already looking forward to the second Chaotic Assembly!
 After everything was arranged, in the third Dao Field, Han Jue sat on the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus again and sighed.
 Han Ling sat beside him and asked, “Father, are you unhappy that Second Brother obtained the Eternal Peak?”
 Han Jue said, “Something big happened during this Chaotic Assembly.”
 He recounted the schemes of the Chaotic Consciousness and the Formless Transcendent Deity. He even mentioned the Ninth Chaos, but he did not mention anything about the Primordial Fiendcelestial.
 He only wanted his daughter’s horizons to broaden and not drag her into danger.
 Han Ling was shocked.
 Without her seeing it, a calamity that endangered the Chaos happened! “Father, what realm are they at? Above the Great Dao Supreme Realm?” Han Ling asked.
 Han Jue nodded.
 Han Ling took a deep breath and did not ask further.
 Han Jue said earnestly, “Ling’er, there’s always someone stronger. You can’t slack off. I hope that you can climb to the peak with me.”
 Han Ling nodded heavily.
 Han Jue smiled in satisfaction and started cultivating.
 Han Ling entered the simulation trial. She wanted to see if Han Huang’s cultivation was updated.
 Indeed. Han Jue had copied all the living beings’ data when he was in Ten Absolute City. Many existences had their cultivation refreshed. The current simulation trial could be said to be extremely up-to-date and contained 90% of the mighty figures in the Chaos.


 The Ultimate God of Punishment brought Han Huang under the Seven Supreme Rules.
 “This is the Eternal Peak’s reward. You can enjoy the baptism of the Supreme Rules.”
 The Ultimate God of Punishment smiled.
 Han Huang revealed a look of anticipation.
 He had already heard of the Supreme Rules. Huang Zuntian and Dao Sovereign’s Great Dao Providence Divine Authority had left a deep impression on him.
 Especially Huang Zuntian. For some reason, he suddenly lost his strength and suffered a crushing defeat.
 The Ultimate God of Punishment began to mobilize the power of the Supreme Rules. A beam of light descended and landed on Han Huang.
 The Ultimate God of Punishment looked at the Supreme Rules. One of the Supreme Rules emitted a pillar of light that connected to his body.
 “Is this the Supreme Rule?”
 The Ultimate God of Punishment was secretly excited and deeply grateful to Han Jue.
 He was very smart and knew that if not for Han Jue, he wouldn’t have been rewarded by the Lord of Chaos.
 In the next thousand years, the names of Ten Absolutes and the Eternal Peak spread to every corner of the Chaos. Even the Ten Thousand Strong, Thousand Lords, and Hundred Sovereigns shocked an area. The success of the Chaotic Assembly made more and more living beings look forward to the next one.
 After prosperity was peace, especially in the endless chaos.
 The Chaotic Consciousness and the Formless Transcendent Deity were suppressed by the Ninth Chaos. Nothing should cause trouble for Han Jue in the next hundred million years. His children and personal disciples should be fine with the Ultimate God of Punishment and the Holy Mother of Order around.
 He could cultivate in peace.
 Time passed quickly.
 The Ultimate Origin World in the depths of Han Jue’s soul kept transforming. There was more and more Ultimate Origin Qi, and more Chaotic Fiendcelestials began to absorb it to cultivate.
 Han Jue looked forward to the changes in these Chaotic Fiendcelestials. Would they transform into Ultimate Origin Fiendcelestials?
 In the blink of an eye.
 Five hundred thousand years passed.
 Han Jue opened his eyes. Han Ling was still cultivating beside him.
 He thought for a moment and entered the simulation trial to challenge the Formless Transcendent Deity.
 In the end, he was insta-killed.
 How f*cking impressive.
 Han Jue didn’t feel defeated. Instead, he looked forward to the Dao Creator Realm even
 more.
 This was a Dao Creator. The difference between a realm was worlds apart. It was not something that cultivation, Mystical Powers, or any external force could make up for.
 Then, Han Jue looked at the emails. There was not much that interested him in the past five hundred thousand years.
 He continued cultivating.
 This time, he planned to enter seclusion for a long time.
 More than four million years later.
 Words appeared in front of Han Jue.
 (Detected that you are 20 million years old and your life has taken another step forward. You have the following choices:]
 (1: Establish the Primordial Chaos in the Chaos. You can obtain a Primordial Fragment, a Great Dao Fragment, a Creation Spirit Stone, and a Heavenly Dao Spirit Stone.]
 [2: Cultivate in a low-profile manner and maintain your original intention. You can obtain a Primordial Fragment, a Great Dao Fragment, and a Creation Spirit Stone.]
 (You have obtained a Creation Heaven’s Chosen attempt.)
 There was nothing to choose from.
 Han Jue directly chose the second option.
 Unknowingly, the Chaotic Assembly had ended for a long time. Han Jue felt as if it was just yesterday.
 He stood up and walked out of the Daoist temple to visit Xing Hongxuan, Qingluan’er, and Xuan Qingjun.
 After some pleasantries, they interacted for decades. Next, he went to the second Dao Field and saw Dao Comprehension Sword and Li Yao.
 This time, he decided to have children with Li Yao and expand the foundation of the Creation Heaven’s Chosen.
 Twenty years later.
 Han Yunjin was optimistic and smart. He was curious about everything.
 Li Yao was also very assured about her son. She felt that her children should be independent when they grew up, just like her back then.
 The news of Han Jue giving birth to his fifth son also spread to all the personal disciples through the Myriad Worlds Projection. Many disciples were curious about Han Yunjin.
 Han Jue returned to the third Dao Field and continued cultivating.
 Han Ling had long been pulled into the Myriad Worlds Projection and knew about this.
 “Father, why don’t you bring Fifth Brother back for me to take a look at?” Han Ling asked.
 Han Jue said, “He’s already grown up and wants to go out. I won’t bring him back to avoid trouble. You can go out if you want to see him.”
 Han Jue smiled and didn’t say anything.
 He opened the emails.
 After so many years, his circle of friends had naturally accumulated a huge amount of information. To him, time passed very quickly, but several eras had passed in the eyes of all living beings.
 Many of Han Jue’s personal disciples were already independent on their own.
 The Life faction dominated an area and built a world like the Heavenly Dao after Huang Zuntian became a Great Dao Divine Spirit.
 Han Huang had also joined the Divine Punishers. His status was higher than the Great Dao Divine Spirit. His cultivation had already reached the late-stage Great Dao Supreme Realm. Not bad.
 Han Jue noticed that Li Daokong had been very active all these years.

 He opened Li Daokong’s profile picture and discovered that this fellow had already attained the Great Dao Supreme.
 Amazing!
 Li Daokong had lived for a long time and was already more than a hundred million years old, so he was not qualified to participate in the Chaotic Assembly. His potential was considered top-notch in the previous Heavenly Dao, but it was nothing in the current Chaos. However, his cultivation had advanced by leaps and bounds in the past ten million years.
 Huang Zuntian had been challenged by Li Daokong several times and had even been severely injured once.
 Han Jue thought for a moment and sent him a dream.
 Although Li Daokong’s favorability towards him had not decreased, it was not good to not interact for too long.
 The dream was the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 Han Jue saw Li Daokong. He was dressed in white and wore a black robe. His hair was black and white. His face was ancient, and a cold, murderous aura brewed between his eyebrows.
 Li Daokong opened his eyes and saw that it was him. He immediately became excited and hurriedly knelt down.
 He had always respected Han Jue. Other than saving his life, he also owed him a favor.
 He had wandered the Chaos for many years and received much care because of his identity as the First Guardian of the Hidden Sect. Even if he joined the Life faction, Han Jue didn’t declare that the First Guardian had betrayed the sect, much less promote a new First Guardian.
 Han Jue smiled and asked, “Get up. How have you been all these years?”
