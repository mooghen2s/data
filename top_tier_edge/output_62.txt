 “My big brother used to follow you?” Han Huang asked curiously. He had long heard of Han Tuo, but he had never seen him before.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor smiled and nodded.
 Han Huang shook his head. “Forget it. Although you treat me very well, you’re not strong. I don’t want to follow you. No one in this world is worth following other than my parents.”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor was stunned.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du’s expression became subtle.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor said, “It’s good to go out and broaden your horizons. Your father is busy with seclusion and doesn’t have the time to take care of you.”
 Han Huang said, “I also want to enter seclusion. Cultivation is the foundation. I won’t go out if I don’t cultivate to be the strongest.”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor couldn’t help but look at Han Jue.
 Han Jue smiled and said, “This is his own idea. I brought him to the Immortal World previously. He lost interest in a few days and wanted to go back.”
  Han Huang nodded. “I’ve already mastered the Sage Sense and observed the Chaos. Although I don’t know everything, the Chaos doesn’t interest me for now.”
 The father and son sat side by side, looking like brothers.
 Han Huang smiled. He was indeed looking forward to meeting his brother.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du asked, “There’s an additional Sage position in the Heavenly Dao. Should we let Han Huang…”
 Han Jue shook his head. “There’s no need. With his personality, it’s impossible for him to manage the Heavenly Dao. Let him stay by my side. As for the Sage position, you can arrange it yourself.”
 Curious, Han Huang asked, “What is the Sage position?”
 “It’s none of your business,” Han Jue replied casually.
 Then, the Evil Heavenly Emperor pulled Han Huang to the side as if he was an elder concerned about a junior. He asked about his father’s well-being while Han Jue and Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du talked about the Heavenly Dao.
 Now that the Chaos was peaceful, the Heavenly Dao could develop freely. The Immortal World was only so big. The number of things that could be interfered with by Sages was limited, so after new Sages appeared, they were all responsible for opening a Chaotic Heavenly Road.
 Han Jue was satisfied with Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du’s conclusion.
 He praised, “The Heavenly Dao is truly fortunate to have the Heavenly Venerate. Come to my Dao Field if you have the time in the future. I will preach the Dao for you and help you embark on the Great Dao as soon as possible.”
Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du was pleasantly surprised and hurriedly thanked him.
 His contact with Laozi had decreased ever since he had chosen the Heavenly Dao. As for being taught again, that was almost impossible. He was also too embarrassed to mention it.
 Several hours later, Han Jue, Han Huang, and the Evil Heavenly Emperor walked out of the Universal Hall.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor looked at Han Huang and smiled dotingly. “Don’t forget our agreement.”
 Han Huang waved his hand and said, “Don’t worry. I’ll be the first to find you if I go to the Chaos!”
 He looked so heroic that Han Jue wanted to laugh.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor left after exchanging some pleasantries. Han Jue then brought Han Huang back to the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 He thought for a moment and then brought him to the second Dao Field.
 Li Yao and Dao Comprehension Sword were still cultivating in the Daoist temple. Sensing Han Huang’s aura, they immediately opened their eyes.
 Their eyes lit up and they immediately stood
 up.
 “Wow, is this your second son?”
 Dao Comprehension Sword approached Han Huang, scaring him away.
 
 Han Jue smiled. “That’s right. His name is Han Huang. Huang’er, these two are your third and fourth mothers.”
 Fourth Mother?
 Dao Comprehension Sword’s face instantly turned red.
 Han Huang bowed. Although he was proud, he was still very polite to his own family.
 Li Yao and Dao Comprehension Sword had already learned of Han Huang’s potential in the Myriad Worlds Projection. They were not the only ones. The personal disciples were the same.
 They had long wanted to see him. They were naturally happy to see him today.
 After a conversation, Han Huang also began to call them Third Mother and Fourth Mother.
 Then, the four of them walked out of the Daoist temple.
 Han Jue gathered all the Fiendcelestials.
 Currently, there were 51 Chaotic Fiendcelestials in the second Dao Field. There was also one being nurtured in the Primordial World.
 The scene was spectacular after the Fiendcelestials gathered.
 Han Huang narrowed his eyes and sized them up. “Is this the Second Young Master? He does look like Master.”
 Han Jue saw through everyone’s thoughts, so he said, “Yes, he’s my second son, Han Huang. He was born as Freedom and has a special bloodline. Your bloodlines have already been raised to the top level of the Chaos. It’s easy for you to be hostile to each other, but this is only a conflict between bloodlines, so I’m letting you know in advance. In the future, you still have to support each other on the path of cultivation.”
 The Fiendcelestials immediately felt relieved and nodded upon hearing this.
 Murong Qi took a step forward and smiled. “Grandmaster, why don’t you let him stay with us for a period of time?”
 The other Fiendcelestials hooted.
 Han Jue said, “That’s my intention.”
 With that, Han Jue turned around and returned to the Daoist temple, leaving Han Huang surrounded by everyone.
 Guan Bubai stared at Han Huang and said, “Junior, you’re very strong. Shall we spar?”
 Han Huang glanced at him and shook his head. Then, he walked in front of the Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial and said, “You’re the strongest. Let’s spar!”
 This scene surprised everyone. The Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial was indeed the strongest. He had been suppressed by Murong Qi in the past and had only recently surpassed
 him.
 Guan Bubai curled his lips and looked unhappy, but he did not dare to refute. He had always been tortured by the Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial and was already a younger brother.
 Only he was stubborn in the second Dao Field. He dared to keep fighting the Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial. As they fought, he developed feelings.
  “Alright!”
 The Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial agreed readily. The two of them directly entered the simulation trial and began sparring
 Several dozen breaths later.
 The simulation ended.
 The two of them opened their eyes and frowned.
 Guan Bubai smiled. “How about it? Little Junior Brother, you should spar with me.”
 Han Huang ignored him and stared at the Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial. “You’re very strong, stronger than Jiang Jueshi.” The Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial took a deep breath and said, “I’m not your match.”
 Everyone was shocked.
 The Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial was defeated?
 “Oh my god, what kind of pervert has Master given birth to! He isn’t even ten thousand years old yet, right?” the Black Hell Chicken shouted, expressing everyone’s thoughts.


 “I’m indeed not ten thousand years old, but you’re not bad either. At least, you’ve impressed me. You seem to contain different powers. Come, let’s spar one by one.”
 Han Huang scanned the Fiendcelestials and smiled. The Fiendcelestials had no objections to this. In any case, they wouldn’t die in the simulation trial. It just so happened that they wanted to test Han Huang’s strength.
 Just like that, Han Huang quickly became friends with the Fiendcelestials.
 On the other side, Han Jue was preaching to Li Yao and Dao Comprehension Sword in the Daoist temple.
 He left with Han Huang ten years later.
 The Fiendcelestials were all convinced by Han Huang’s talent. Han Jue estimated that if he abdicated in the future, the position of Sect Master of the Hidden Sect would probably go to Han Huang. At least, Han Huang had the support of the 51 Chaotic Fiendcelestials.
 Back in the third Dao Field.
 Han Huang curled his lips and said, “Why must you bring me back? I want to stay there.”
 Han Jue scolded jokingly. “Of course, you find it interesting that you bully them every day. Think about it, would you find it interesting if you were always defeated by Jiang Jueshi?”
  “He’s definitely not my match now. Call him over!” Han Huang said angrily. His pride also had grown as he grew up. The defeat back then was his only humiliation.
 Han Jue said, “What? You still hate him? Are you so petty?”
 Han Huang snorted. “Of course not. How can I hate him since we’re fellow disciples? I just can’t accept that I lost.”
 ......
 “Go out and find a place to cultivate. Don’t stay beside me in the future. From today onwards, I will resume my seclusion. My seclusion lasts for a hundred thousand years every time.”
 Han Jue waved his hand.
 A hundred thousand years?
 Han Huang’s eyes lit up, and the corners of his mouth curled up.
 He immediately bowed and walked out of the palace.
 Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief.
 He could finally cultivate in peace.
 Han Jue only believed in one principle, which was to rely on himself!
 Han Jue still didn’t know his limit ever since he had evolved into the Ultimate Origin Fiendcelestial. Previously, insta-killing the 100,000 Foolish Sword Sages was not his limit. Now was a good time to try.
 Han Jue entered the simulation trial. He directly fought 150,000 Foolish Sword Sages!
 How terrifying were 150,000 Great Dao Supreme experts? At first, Han Jue was suppressed, but he gained the upper hand not long after. In the end, he used five minutes to kill all 150,000 Foolish Sword Sages!
 Han Jue continued to challenge.
 He could kill 150,000 Foolish Sword Sages in three breaths after hundreds of times.
 This was already the limit. After all, a Great Dao Supreme was not a mortal.
 It would be even harder to kill all 150,000 Great Dao Supremes if this was reality.
 After all, a Great Dao Supreme would escape. The opponents in the simulation trial would only die in battle.
 Han Jue was in high spirits and continued cultivating after confirming his strength.
 He could instantly kill 150,000 Foolish Sword Sages if he broke through!
 The sea of clouds surrounded the mountains and overlapped like steps that led to the sky.
 On a mountainside.
 Dao Sovereign, Zhao Xuanyuan, Jiang Yi, Lao Dan, Han Tuo, and Yi Tian were drinking and chatting in the pavilion.
 “In that case, that kid called Han Huang will reach the Great Dao Realm soon? Tsk tsk, his potential is indeed ridiculous. Why isn’t Han Tuo so powerful?” Yi Tian swirled his wine and clicked his tongue in wonder.
 Han Tuo smiled helplessly. “My father’s cultivation level was worlds apart from when he gave birth to me and my younger brother. There’s naturally a difference in our potential.”
 Lao Dan sighed. “Such potential is no longer ridiculous. It’s truly unprecedented.”
 Jiang Yi smiled. “Little Junior has such a start. I wonder if he can cultivate patiently.”
 The others discussed. Han Huang became the main topic.
 Han Tuo smiled. Although he had never seen Han Huang, he liked his younger brother very much.
  How could he not like the fact that this little brother was a topic to brag about ever since he was born?
 Not long after, everyone put down the topic of Han Huang and started to talk about serious matters.
 “You want to go to the bottom of the Chaos?” Han Tuo frowned.
 Lao Dan smiled and said, “Don’t worry, just let us in. We won’t trouble you later.”
 Dao Sovereign nodded.
 Zhao Xuanyuan sighed. “I feel like I’m going to be in trouble again.”
 Dao Sovereign glared at him, signaling him to shut up.
 Yi Tian said, “The bottom of the Chaos is very dangerous. We almost died there. Even the leader of the Divine Spirits is afraid of that place.”
 Lao Dan smiled leisurely. “Don’t worry. My main body has been there before, but it’s been sealed recently. I can’t find the entrance. I want to seek opportunities for these three brats. After all, the Chaotic Assembly is getting closer and closer.”
 Chaotic Assembly!
 Now, this meeting had already attracted the attention of the entire Chaos. Even the Five Great Divine Punishers had to participate and represent the Ultimate God of Punishment to prove themselves.
 Han Tuo glanced at the three of them and hesitated for a moment before nodding.
 Seeing this, Dao Sovereign and Jiang Yi smiled. Zhao Xuanyuan sighed.
 Yi Tian suddenly asked, “Will Han Huang participate in the Chaotic Assembly? If he obtains the Eternal Peak at a few million years old…”
 He was especially interested in Han Huang.
 Everyone looked at each other, not knowing how to reply.
 They wanted to say that it was impossible, but Han Huang was born with unlimited possibilities.
 For a time, the pavilion fell silent. They suddenly realized that Han Huang might be the strongest opponent.
 Time passed quickly. A hundred thousand years passed in the blink of an eye.
 Han Jue opened his eyes. Surprise flashed across them.
 What a domineering Ultimate Origin Fiendcelestial. His cultivation speed far exceeded that of before. It was at least ten times faster!
 At this rate, he would soon break through to the late-stage Great Dao Supreme Realm!
 His bloodline was two levels higher than the top geniuses in the Chaos, so his cultivation speed was naturally the fastest.
 Han Jue glanced at Han Huang in the Daoist temple next door.
 This kid was actually a Great Dao Sage already.
 He needed to step into the door of the Great Dao after attaining the Great Dao. Would this kid cause trouble?
 Han Jue was busy cultivating, so he ignored the Chaos.
 He pinched his fingers to deduce and smiled.
 “The Divine Robe Daoist is not bad.”
 It turned out that before Han Huang broke through the door of the Great Dao, the Divine Robe Daoist’s will had arrived behind the door to help him. With him around, naturally, no Great Dao Sage or Great Dao Divine Spirit stopped Han Huang.
Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates Han Huang broke through very smoothly and even became friends with the Divine Robe Daoist.
 The two of them agreed to meet when they had time.
  The Divine Robe Daoist was very sensible.
 Han Jue suddenly thought of something and asked in his mind, “Other than me, does anyone know that Han Huang is the Primordial Fiendcelestial?”
 (3 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [No]
 Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief.
 On second thought, it made sense. With the rampage of the Divine Authority Generals, the legend of the misfortune of the Primordial Fiendcelestial had long collapsed. All living beings thought that the Primordial Fiendcelestial was fabricated.
 As for Han Huang’s potential, all living beings could understand it with the Divine Might Heavenly Sage’s reputation.
 Now, it depended on what the Dao Creators thought.
 The Dao Creators would not make a move as long as Han Huang could not threaten the entire Chaos. In the eyes of all living beings, they did not know the existence of the Dao Creator at all. Not to mention the Great Dao Supreme Realm, they thought that the Great Dao Sage Realm was the apex!


 “Will Han Huang be targeted by the Dao Creators if he participates in the Chaotic Assembly?”
 (1 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Han Jue silently chose to continue as he looked at the line of words in front of him.
 [No]
 Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief.
 He suddenly became interested in the Dao Creators’ perspective.
 What kind of danger could make them unable to sit still?
 Previously, the Chaotic Consciousness still did not make a move when he killed twenty thousand Divine Authority Generals.
 This could only mean one thing. The difference between the Great Dao Supreme Realm and the Dao Creator Realm was unimaginable. It was precisely because the difference was too great that the Dao Creators felt that everything was certain.
  Han Jue stopped thinking about this question. He would naturally understand when he reached the Dao Creator level.
 He opened the emails and checked them. It had been a long time since he had read them.
 (Your good friend Huang Zuntian has obtained a huge amount of Faith Power. His cultivation has increased greatly.]
 ......
 (Your good friend Pan Xin received guidance from your good friend Pan Gu. He has learned a Great Dao Mystical Power.)
 (Your grand-disciple Chu Shiren has entered the Ancient Desolate.]
 [Your good friend Divine Lord Peacock was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure. His Dao soul was damaged.]
 (Your good friend Divine Lord Peacock has been deprived of his Connate Origin. His intelligence has been sealed.]
 (Your good friend Immortal Emperor Samsara received guidance from a mysterious mighty figure. His providence has increased greatly.]
 (Your disciple Dao Sovereign has entered the bottom of the Chaos.]
 The recent emails were very harmonious. There were no large-scale attacks.
 Han Jue’s attention was attracted by Divine Lord Peacock.
 This fellow had been suppressed for a period of time and had yet to escape?
 It seemed like he couldn’t hold on much longer.
 No matter what, this fellow was the Dark Forbidden Lord’s pawn. He couldn’t fall behind.
 Han Jue thought for a moment and sent a dream to Divine Lord Peacock in the image of the Dark Forbidden Lord.
 Divine Lord Peacock’s intelligence had been sealed, but that was only because it couldn’t fuse with his body and not because his rationality had been erased.
 In the dream.
 Divine Lord Peacock saw the Dark Forbidden Lord and immediately heaved a sigh of relief. Then, he looked ashamed.
 All these years, he used all sorts of methods, but he still could not escape. He had wanted to seek help from the Dark Forbidden Lord countless times, but he was afraid of losing face and could only endure.
 Han Jue asked, “Why did you go to the Ancient Desolate? Who suppressed you?”
 Divine Lord Peacock did not dare to be careless anymore and told him everything.
 He was even more ashamed. He didn’t know who the other party was.
 Han Jue said, “Just wait.”
 He removed the dream.
 Han Jue began to use the derivation function. He sent a dream first to tell Divine Lord Peacock that he was the one who helped him and affirm his loyalty.
 (1 trillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 A trillion years of lifespan…
 It was equivalent to Laozi!
 He didn’t expect such an existence to be hiding in the Ancient Desolate!
 Continue!
 Han Jue thought silently. If the other party was too strong, he could only give up on Divine Lord Peacock.
 There was no need to risk everything for him.
 He had already saved Divine Lord Peacock before, but this fellow was useless.
 Han Jue would have long given up on him if not for the fact that he had contributed to pestering the Curse Fiendcelestial.
 A figure appeared in Han Jue’s mind and a line of words appeared in front of him.
 Indeed, his cultivation level is the same as mine!
 Such an existence was actually suppressed by the Dao Ancestor. Could the Dao Ancestor be a Dao Creator?
 Han Jue checked his interpersonal relationships. The portrait of the Dao Ancestor was still black and his cultivation was still unknown.
 Han Jue asked in his mind, “Is the Dao Ancestor a Dao Creator?”
 (Unable to capture the karma. Perhaps it doesn’t exist.)
 What a Dao Ancestor!
 “Is there a Dao Ancestor among the five Great Dao Creators?”
 (Unable to capture the karma. Perhaps it doesn’t exist.)
 Han Jue could only give up and focus on Ancestor Tian Xu.
 “Can I insta-kill Ancestor Tian Xu?” [1 trillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?] Continue!
 [Yes]
 That was fine.
 Han Jue immediately sent a dream to Ancestor Tian Xu in the image of the Dark Forbidden Lord.
 He would talk first. He would consider destruction if that didn’t work.
 It wasn’t easy for everyone to cultivate. It was fine as long as the karma could be resolved. Han Jue didn’t want to be stained with hostility.
 In the dream.
 Covered in black, Han Jue saw Ancestor Tian Xu.
 Ancestor Tian Xu had white hair and wore a tattered gray robe. Although his clothes were ragged, his temperament was still extraordinary. Especially his eyes. They were filled with dignity, as if they could see through everything in the world.
 Ancestor Tian Xu frowned in surprise upon seeing him.
 The other party could actually forcefully pull him into a dream. He was quite capable!
 However, he didn’t know the Dark Forbidden Lord. He sighed at the rise of the younger generation. He had been suppressed by the Dao Ancestor for a long time. It was not surprising that a new mighty figure had appeared in the Chaos.
 Han Jue was the first to speak. “Fellow Daoist, my subordinate accidentally entered the Ancient Desolate and offended you. He was suppressed by you for so many years and has been punished. Why don’t you let him go?
 Patriarch Tian Xu narrowed his eyes and asked, “Who are you talking about?” “Divine Lord Peacock.”
 “Oh? So it’s him. This little peacock keeps saying that he has a backing, but I didn’t see anyone. I thought he was bluffing, but it’s true.”
 “What do you think, fellow Daoist?”
 Ancestor Tian Xu didn’t answer immediately. Instead, he stared at Han Jue, thinking about something
 Han Jue was not in a hurry.
 After a long while…
 Ancestor Tian Xu asked, “What’s your name, fellow Daoist? I’m Ancestor Tian Xu. Perhaps you’ve never heard of me.”
 Han Jue said, “All living beings call me the Dark Forbidden Lord. As for your name, I naturally know it. Otherwise, how can I visit you in your dreams? As the founder of the Heavenly Ruins Divine World, you created the first world in the Chaos, but your fate is not
 good.”
 Han Jue asked, “Is it related to the Dao Ancestor?”
 Ancestor Tian Xu was moved and narrowed his eyes.
 He suddenly flew into a rage. “Dao Ancestor! Hahaha! What sort of Dao Ancestor is he! Don’t mention him anymore! That’s all. I’ll send that little peacock out of the Ancient Desolate!”
 The dream shattered.
  Han Jue opened his eyes. He didn’t expect Ancestor Tian Xu to be so emotional. However, he shouldn’t go back on his word since he didn’t hate him.
 Since he had nothing to do, Han Jue continued to visit his dreams. This time, his target was Huang Zuntian.
 He used his main body this time.
 In the dream.
 It had been a long time. Huang Zuntian had already changed his attitude. His aura was not weaker than the Divine Robe Daoist.
 Huang Zuntian was not excited to see Han Jue. He asked, “I have an opportunity. Do you want it?”
 Han Jue rolled his eyes. “No.”
 Huang Zuntian immediately knelt excitedly.
 Han Jue asked about his recent situation. Huang Zuntian didn’t hide anything and told him everything.
 Huang Zuntian had already taken charge of most of the Calamity Life Controllers. Even Ancestor Xitian, Li Daokong, Shi Dudao, and the others were under him.


 Han Jue had no choice but to size him up again upon hearing that Ancestor Xitian and the others were also subdued by him.
 Unknowingly, Huang Zuntian was already powerful enough to break Han Jue’s impression of him.
 Before this, in Han Jue’s heart, Ancestor Xitian was definitely stronger than Huang Zuntian.
 Han Jue suddenly wanted to calculate his future.
 Huang Zuntian talked about his experiences in high spirits. He was no longer the mortal who had crawled around in the Jie School.
 To Han Jue, time passed very quickly, but to Huang Zuntian, time passed very slowly. He looked extremely glorious now, but in fact, he had paid an unimaginable price and effort. He felt tired when he recalled it.
 Scheming, power struggles, persuasion, and so on. He took every step very carefully, afraid that he would fail.
 Huang Zuntian changed the topic and suddenly said seriously, “Master, my subordinates discovered something recently, something unusual that might endanger the Chaos.”
 Han Jue didn’t say anything. This fellow actually learned to keep people in suspense!
 Han Jue narrowed his eyes and fell into deep thought.
 Could it be that Ancestor Tian Xu was brewing a plan to take revenge on the Dao Ancestor?
 It was very likely!
 “The Ancient Desolate is a forbidden land. Some time ago, many mighty figures died inside, so no one is paying attention to it anymore. It was after this that the speed at which the Dao Devils in the Ancient Desolate increased far exceeded before. Such an increase in power must be for a reason. Most importantly, I didn’t find out the mastermind behind them. I only know that the Ancestor Tian Xu who created the first world in the Chaos was also a Dao Devil and was the strongest one,” Huang Zuntian said with a solemn expression. He seemed to have fought with Ancestor Tian Xu before, and his eyes revealed fear.
 Han Jue’s expression changed slightly. Ancestor Tian Xu was a Dao Devil?
 Could it be that there was someone else behind this?
 The Great Dao Divine Spirits no longer chased after the Life faction after the Primordial Ancestor God died. This gave them a chance to rest.
 Huang Zuntian said, “I plan to establish a lineage and live in seclusion. I’ll make plans when the lineage is perfected. The current Chaos looks peaceful, but I feel that there are undercurrents.”
 Han Jue nodded. “It’s indeed time to settle down. Time will erase everything.”
 The two of them chatted for a while more before he removed the dream.
 This dream was mainly to tell Huang Zuntian that he still cared about him.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and asked in his mind, “I want to know who’s behind the Dao Devils?”
 (100 trillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?)
 100 trillion years was equivalent to a hundred times stronger than Laozi and ten times weaker than a Dao Creator.
 It was not Ancestor Tian Xu!
 Han Jue immediately chose to continue.
 (Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit: Perfected Great Dao Supreme Realm, Half-step Creator, Transcendent Dao Expert, Spirit of Heaven and Earth, Lord of Negative Karma, Lord of Dao Devils, Heavenly Dao Evil Spirit]
 Half-step Creator!
 How impressive!
 Han Jue was attracted by the words “Heavenly Dao Evil Spirit”. Was this fellow related to the Heavenly Dao?
 It made sense when he thought about it carefully. The Ancient Desolate was formed by the shattering of the Primordial World. Most of it had transformed into the Ancient Desolate, and the remaining transformed into the Immortal World. The Ancient Desolate’s spirit was naturally related to the Heavenly Dao.
 The Heavenly Dao did not seem powerful in the Chaos, but it was deliberately suppressed by the Dao Ancestor. In fact, the Heavenly Dao was ancient. They could cultivate to the top of the Chaos if it was any other living being
 “Can I insta-kill the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit?”
  [100 trillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [No]
 Han Jue was a little disappointed.
 However, on second thought, it made sense. After all, the other party was already half-step into the Creator Realm. He wasn’t someone a Great Dao Supreme could kill.
 Han Jue didn’t think too much about it. He would wait for Divine Lord Peacock to escape. Then, he would directly inform him and let him worry.
 After all, the Lord of Chaos was the Ultimate God of Punishment, not him, the Divine Might Heavenly Sage.
 Then, Han Jue closed his eyes and continued cultivating
 Under the old tree.
 Han Qing’er stared at the distant disciples in boredom. She yawned and muttered, “Why isn’t Second Brother out of seclusion yet? Is seclusion so fun?”
 At her side, Qingluan’er smiled and said, “Your second brother has great ambitions. How can he be like you, cultivating diligently like your father one moment and feeling bored the next?”
 She believed that any prodigy would lose their confidence when they saw Han Huang, especially when this fellow was her biological brother.
 Qingluan’er covered her mouth and laughed.
 At this moment, Han Huang’s Daoist temple suddenly opened. A figure slowly walked out and arrived in front of them in a few steps.
 Han Qing’er looked at the person in front of her and was stunned.
 It was Han Huang.
 He was handsome and tall. His eyes were filled with arrogance. His white robe fluttered and his black hair was tied behind his head with a thin rope. Not only was his talent unparalleled, but so was his temperament.
 Han Huang smiled. “Qing’er, I’ve already attained the Great Dao and even created my own Mystical Power. Am I powerful?”
 “Impressive, impressive!” Han Qing’er said perfunctorily, but she was shocked inside.
 She knew that Han Huang was monstrous, but she didn’t expect him to be talented to this extent.
 Great Dao!
 Han Qing’er’s heart ached. She was like a mortal in front of her second brother.
  Han Qing’er immediately beamed. The sorrow in her heart vanished. She punched Han Huang’s chest and scolded him jokingly. “At least you have a conscience.”
 Han Huang said, “Of course!”
 Han Huang had liked to stick to Han Qing’er ever since he was young. The two of them had never left home, so their relationship was naturally not distant.
 Han Huang chatted with Qingluan’er and Han Qing’er for a while before bidding farewell to visit his mother, Xing Hongxuan.
 It was mainly to show off his gains.
 However, Xing Hongxuan was indifferent, making him secretly angry. It was still his Third Mother who gave him face.
 Eldest Mother was Xing Hongxuan, Second Mother was Xuan Qingjun, Third Mother was Qingluan’er, Fourth Mother was Li Yao, and Fifth Mother was Dao Comprehension Sword. This was a relationship that Han Jue later sorted out.
 Han Huang made up his mind to visit Qingluan’er instead of Xing Hongxuan in the future.
 He walked out of his mother’s Daoist temple and was about to return to cultivate when he suddenly looked up.
 At this moment, countless sailboats were sailing over from outside the universe of stars. Every sailboat carried thousands of living beings with different postures. They looked like humans and demons.


 Sailboats followed the same direction in the vast void.
 On the deck of a huge sailboat at the front stood a middle-aged Daoist. Ten palm-sized stone slabs circled around his body like a puzzle, mysterious and unfathomable.
Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates The middle-aged Daoist stared at the beautiful starry universe ahead and frowned.
 A living being with a snake body and human head beside him smiled and said, “I didn’t expect such a Heaven’s Beyond to be hidden in the Chaos. It’s very suitable for us races to survive.”
 The middle-aged Daoist said, “Something’s wrong. There are no powerful restrictions nearby, and there’s no aura of living beings inside. Why aren’t there any other races here?”
 The snake-headed man said, “The Chaos is endless. It’s normal that it’s not discovered by living beings.”
 “That’s true, but it’s better to be careful.”
 The middle-aged Daoist hesitated.
 The snake-headed man nodded and went down to pass the order.
  At the same time.
 In the third Dao Field.
 Han Huang looked at the races outside the universe with a happy expression.
 “Freedom Sage, you can give me a chance to practice and eat,” Han Huang muttered to himself. He jumped and wanted to rush out.
 Boom
 The invisible Dao Field array formation in the sky blocked him. The sky rippled, startling all the disciples in the Dao Field.
 Han Qing’er was surprised. What was this kid trying to do?
 She looked up and quickly saw the mysterious race outside the universe.
 “Second Brother, don’t worry. There won’t be any danger with Jiang Jieshi around,” Han Qing’er shouted. She had previously witnessed Jiang Jieshi taking action to resist the enemy.
 Han Huang frowned when he heard that.
 He didn’t continue to fight the Dao Field array formation. He turned around and flew in front of Han Jue’s Daoist temple. He wanted to enter and asked him to let him out, but he couldn’t open the door.
 Han Jue was busy cultivating and couldn’t be disturbed.
 Han Huang was moved. He was already a Great Dao Sage, but he couldn’t open this door.
 He knew that his father was very strong, but he didn’t expect him to still be so strong that he couldn’t even tell how much.
 He was already a Great Dao Sage, but he couldn’t even open the door of a Daoist temple?
 Han Huang didn’t believe it. He gritted his teeth and continued pushing, using all his strength.
 However, he couldn’t open the door no matter how hard he tried. Even using the Divine Might Great Heaven Palm was useless.
 Han Huang let go and left.
 He returned to his Daoist temple to cultivate in seclusion.
 At the same time, Jiang Jueshi moved out of the universe. Han Qing’er began to watch the battle.
 Jiang Jueshi was already invincible in the Freedom Realm. The leader of the other party’s race was only a Freedom Sage, so he was naturally not his match.
 The battle did not last long. Jiang Jueshi easily won.
 Han Qing’er sighed. “No wonder he can suppress Second Brother. He’s indeed powerful.”
 She was very respectful every time she watched Jiang Jueshi’s battle.
 Qingluan’er also witnessed the battle and praised him. “As expected of your father’s disciple. He should be your father’s most proud disciple, right?”
 Han Qing’er shook her head. “Not necessarily. I heard from Second Brother that Jiang Jueshi is at most in the top ten under Father.”
 Qingluan’er shook her head and laughed.
 Han Qing’er glanced at her and couldn’t help but ask, “Mother, you don’t seem to be curious about Father? Be careful not to let Father find a few more women!”
 Qingluan’er smiled. “So be it. Your father has been filled with mystery ever since I met him. I like him to be mysterious. Reviving is already something I didn’t dare to think about in the past. How can I disturb your father’s cultivation?”
 Han Qing’er curled her lips. She couldn’t understand her mother, but she didn’t say anything
 Everyone had their own choices.
 Han Qing’er wondered how heroic her husband would be.
 No!
 Her father was the strongest. It was fine as long as he was 80% as good as him!
 Another hundred thousand years passed.
 Han Jue opened his eyes. His cultivation had improved greatly.
 He first sent a dream to Divine Lord Peacock and confirmed that he had escaped.
 Divine Lord Peacock kept kowtowing to him in the dream.
 He told him about the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit.
 “I already know about this. The Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit is very powerful. I’m not his match,” the Ultimate God of Punishment said with a solemn expression. This was also why he did not dare to personally go to the Ancient Desolate.
 Han Jue raised his eyebrows. He knew that the Ultimate God of Punishment was not the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit’s match. The difference in value was huge. He only wanted him to prepare early.
 The Ultimate God of Punishment said helplessly, “Fellow Daoist, you should be able to see that there are many areas in the Chaos that can’t be spied on. The mighty figures hidden are immeasurable. After all, the Chaos has existed for a long time, so long that it’s impossible to calculate the time.”
 Han Jue remained silent.
 Why did he feel that the Ultimate God of Punishment was weaker now?
 On second thought, it made sense. In the past, the Ultimate God of Punishment had challenged high-level figures and had far fewer enemies than the Primordial Ancestor God. Now that he was sitting in the Primordial Ancestor God’s position, countless eyes were staring at him. The pressure was far greater than before, and he did not dare to act recklessly.
 “I will be careful about this matter. Thank you for your reminder, Fellow Daoist. You don’t have to worry. I also have a certain understanding of the Ancient Desolate. It can’t harm the Chaos for now,” the Ultimate God of Punishment said seriously. His tone was sincere, as if he was touched by Han Jue’s gesture.
 Han Jue didn’t believe that he would be touched and immediately chatted with him.
 He opened his eyes after ending the dream.
 From the Ultimate God of Punishment’s words, could this fellow have a good relationship with the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit?
 He should be uneasy even if he couldn’t win, but he was so calm. It was very likely that they were on good terms.
 Han Jue didn’t have the urge to spend his lifespan to derive it. It was fine even if he didn’t guess correctly. In any case, he was on good terms with the Ultimate God of Punishment, which was equivalent to being on good terms with the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit.
 It had nothing to do with him who was the boss in the Chaos as long as they didn’t provoke him.
 He could hide in the Dao Field even if they wanted to provoke him.
 No one could barge into his Dao Field in the entire Chaos, including the Dao Creators.
 Han Jue began to check his emails and paid attention to the recent developments in his circle of friends.
 Fog covered the sky in a dark world. The ground was flat and vast.
 Dao Sovereign, Zhao Xuanyuan, and Jiang Yi sat together. Lao Dan stood not far away and looked around.
  “There’s no danger, right? I already told you. Don’t worry, my treasure is reliable. It will definitely inform us if any dangerous aura approaches.” Zhao Xuanyuan smiled.
 Lao Dan snorted. “Your treasure might work elsewhere, but not here.”
 Zhao Xuanyuan shook his head and laughed.
 Jiang Yi said, “I really feel like something is staring at us. Could it be the fellow who hunted us earlier?”
 “No way. How long has it been? We’ve been recuperating for a thousand years.”
 Zhao Xuanyuan frowned and felt uneasy.
 It was difficult for them to predict good things, but one would be more accurate than the other if it was something unlucky.
 The more Zhao Xuanyuan thought about it, the more uneasy he became.
 He suddenly stood up and looked around, afraid that an enemy would appear.
 Jiang Yi sighed. “I’m already prepared to be injured.”
