 Tens of millions of Heavenly troops shouted excitedly.
 “We won!”
 “Who was that mighty figure just now?”
 “Didn’t you notice that he looks very similar to Divine General Han?”
 “Wow—Could it be the legendary father of Divine General Han? How terrifying. He killed 13 Lives first before killing the Great Dao Divine Spirit. He killed them all!”
 “Is the Great Dao Divine Spirit really dead?”
  “Definitely. Otherwise, they would definitely jump out now!”
 It was not only the Heavenly troops. The disciples of the Great Dao Sages and the cultivators of the Great Dao Tower were also discussing excitedly.
 A total of 23 Great Dao Sages fought against the Despair Dao Spirit but did not gain the upper hand.
 But Han Jue instantly killed the Despair Dao Spirit!
 Not to mention them, even the Great Dao Sages were shocked.
 Fuxitian smiled bitterly. “We didn’t lose in
 vain.”
 Nüwa was silent.
 She was still in shock because she heard the cheers in the distance. Those Lives didn’t escape but were killed by Han Jue.
 How long had it been since they were trapped in the darkness?
 Han Jue had clearly attained the Great Dao tens of thousands of years ago. Why was he so
 powerful?
 Could it be that he had already surpassed the Great Dao Realm?
 The Great Dao Sages looked at each other and saw the shock and fear in each other’s eyes.
 That’s right!
 Terror!
 If Han Jue wanted to kill them earlier, they would definitely not be able to escape!
 The more the Great Dao Sages thought about it, the more afraid they became. At the same time, their impression of Han Jue changed.
 This person was not bloodthirsty. Unless he had no choice, he would not attack. But once he attacked, it would definitely be a death blow!
 It was undoubtedly not wise to provoke such an enemy!
 The Great Dao Sages had their own judgment.
 On the other side.
 Yi Tian hugged Han Tuo and said excitedly, “Brother! Good brother! Introduce me to your father. I want to acknowledge him as my master!”
 Zhou Fan said proudly, “You can only be a grand-disciple. What do you think?”
 Chu Shiren smiled and said, “My disciple Zhou Mingyue might accept you.”
 Han Tuo came back to his senses and listened to the cries of the surrounding people. He was filled with pride.
 Qin Ling realized that Han Jue was Han Tuo’s father. Wasn’t he the ancestor of his Grandmaster?
 Gasp
 Wasn’t his background too powerful?
 Inside the Daoist temple.
 Han Jue sat on the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus and took a deep breath.
 He became even more nervous after the battle ended.
 It had to be said.
 W Was
 The battle just now was very satisfying! He suddenly understood those battle maniacs!
 No!
 I can’t immerse myself in this pleasure. This is a trick of the Great Dao to confuse me!
 Han Jue adjusted his state of mind and let his Dao heart calm down.
 He was still him. Nothing had changed.
 At this moment, notifications appeared in front of him.
 [Nüwa has a favorable impression of you. Current favorability: 3 stars]
 [Jie Yin has a favorable impression of you. Current favorability: 2 stars]
 [Di Jiang has a favorable impression of you. Current favorability: 4 stars]
 [Heavenly Lord of Primordial Beginning has a favorable impression of you. Current favorability: 2 stars]
 The 23 Great Dao Sages who went to the Heavenly Court all had a favorable impression of him, including his previous enemies.
 Han Jue cursed silently. As expected of the Sages. Their EQ was maxed out?
 This was also good. He could turn hostility into friendship. It was better to have more friends than enemies.
 However, Han Jue still wouldn’t let down his guard against them unless they were willing to enter his Primordial Heavenly Prison.
 Han Jue began to summarize his gains.
 He killed many enemies and copied a lot of simulation trial data. It was a huge harvest.
 Han Jue didn’t have to be stubborn with Ancestor Xitian anymore.
 Thinking of him, Han Jue used the derivation function.
 “I want to know why Ancestor Xitian was suppressed by the Chaotic Consciousness.”
 (1 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 Han Jue entered the illusion.
 He opened his eyes, and a dazzling light entered his eyes. In front of him were layers of clouds. The huge sun hung at the end of the clouds. In front of the sun was a mighty figure that blocked most of the sunlight.
 Even Han Jue couldn’t see the other party’s true appearance.
 An unfathomable power isolated the senses and Sage Sense of the Great Dao Sage.
 Chaotic Consciousness!
 “Xitian, tell me the identity of the Dark Forbidden Lord.”
 The Chaotic Consciousness was very solemn and loud.
 Ancestor Xitian lowered his head. “I don’t know.”
 “I’ve already deduced that the Dark Forbidden Lord once saved you. How can you not know?”
 “When did he save me? Why don’t I know?” Ancestor Xitian looked up and asked.
 Chaotic Consciousness said, “Perhaps not now.”
 Ancestor Xitian frowned.
 Han Jue also frowned. So Ancestor Xitian was beaten because of him?
 Ancestor Xitian shook his head. “I don’t know.”
 “You really don’t know?”
 “I don’t know.”
 “Alright!”
 The chaotic voice suddenly changed, filled with pressure.
 The illusion shattered.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and frowned.
 He was puzzled. Did Ancestor Xitian know his identity? If he did, could the Chaotic Consciousness not directly read his memories?
 Han Jue didn’t continue calculating. Anyway, Ancestor Xitian suffered because of him.
 Han Jue could only sigh.
 He was too weak and could not resist the Chaotic Consciousness at all, let alone Ancestor Xitian who had already escaped.
 It seemed that the identity of the Dark Forbidden Lord was very special. He was already a thorn in the eyes of the Chaotic Consciousness.
 He had to think of a way to divert his attention. Otherwise, it would be troublesome in the future.
 Han Jue suddenly thought of Life.
 Life called itself Darkness. He could use it.
 By pretending to be the Dark Forbidden Lord, wouldn’t he, who killed Life, be the Dark Forbidden Lord’s enemy?
 Han Jue felt that this was a good idea!
 He immediately brought out the Life he had subdued from the Primordial World and threw it into the Primordial Heavenly Prison.
 Life was still suppressed by various Great Dao powers and had yet to awaken.
 Han Jue closed his eyes and prepared to cultivate.
 The battle of the Heavenly Court felt longer than ten thousand years.
 At this moment…
 (First Life Black Sovereign has developed hatred towards you. Current Hatred Points: 6 stars]
 Han Jue opened his eyes and raised his eyebrows.
 It’s time!
 Life’s backing!
 He immediately pulled out his interpersonal relationships and found the portrait of the First Life Black Sovereign.
  (First Life Black Sovereign: Late-stage Great Dao Supreme, First Life, Master of the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority, Calamity Life Controller, Lord of Darkness. An ancient living being born before the Chaos. After the Chaos was born, it was rejected by the rules of Chaos and lingered in the Primordial Void. Later, it was affected by the battle of the Chaotic Fiendcelestials and was destroyed by Pangu. However, its divine authority protected its will, making it last forever. Because you killed the Calamity Life Controller, it developed hatred towards you. Current Hatred Points: 6 stars]
 Born before the Chaos?
 Goodness!
 How long had he lived?
 Han Jue sighed.
 Most importantly, after living for so long, he was only at the Great Dao Supreme Realm.
 The Chaotic Deities were definitely existences that appeared after the Chaos, but the Chaotic Consciousness was already a Dao Creator.
 As a senior of the Chaotic Consciousness, the First Life Black Sovereign had been living a miserable life. No wonder he was so hostile towards the Chaos.


 He had to cultivate for ten thousand years to calm down.
 The battle of the Heavenly Court was intense. Legends about Han Jue quickly spread in the Chaos over the next thousand years.
 The Heavenly Dao didn’t know about this. Before the Heavenly Dao Sages knew about this, they had taken the initiative to negotiate peace.
 Outside the 33rd Heaven.
 Universal Hall.
 The Sages gathered.
  Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du recounted the requests of the Great Dao Sages in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End.
 Qiu Xilai frowned. “They allowed the living beings of the Heavenly Dao to seek opportunities in their domain and even promised to give them some help. Spreading Dao techniques? Could it be a trap?”
 The South Extreme Heavenly Venerate also frowned with a strange expression. “I’ve also received the initiative of the Chaotic Jie School to express goodwill. They hope that I can persuade you to let go of your past grudges, and they say that they’re willing to befriend the Heavenly Dao again and won’t interfere with it in the future. How can this be? What happened?”
 The other Sages spoke.
 “How strange.”
 “Could it be that they want to attack the Heavenly Dao, so they’re trying to numb us in advance?”
 “No way. This method is too clumsy.”
 “My ancestor, the Heavenly Lord of Primordial Beginning, said that he was willing to give the Heavenly Dao a million spots to listen to the Dao. He will escort these listeners safely back to the Chaotic Heavenly Road. This is no longer a show of goodwill. He’s practically begging the Heavenly Dao to befriend them.”
 It turned out that it was not only Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du. The other Heavenly Dao Sages had also been roped in by the Great Dao Sages.
 Heavenly Venerate Wufa said, “Something big must have happened in the Chaos.”
 Emperor Xiao said, “Don’t be in a hurry to make a decision. Let’s investigate the situation first.”
 Xu Dudao asked, “Should we ask Senior Pan and Senior Han?”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said in a low voice, “Let’s wait for Fellow Daoist Pan to return first. He should be able to find out what happened in the Chaos.”
 Before the matter was concluded, he wouldn’t disturb Han Jue’s cultivation.
 Han Jue was the greatest reliance of the Heavenly Dao. He couldn’t annoy him for no reason.
 If Han Jue was really a Great Dao Sage, the Heavenly Dao was dispensable to him. The reason why Han Jue stayed was only for peace and quiet.
 ce
 The Sages nodded in agreement.
 Ten thousand years passed quickly.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and discovered that Life had yet to be successfully enslaved. As expected of a Great Dao Sage, it took a long time to subdue him.
 He noticed that Li Xuan’ao was waiting outside the Hundred Peak Immortal River with a large group of disciples. He directly moved all of them into the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 He started checking his emails.
 (Your good friend Evil Heavenly Emperor has received guidance from your good friend Jie Yin. His cultivation has increased greatly.]
 [Your disciple Zhou Fan has received guidance from your good friend Nüwa. His cultivation has increased greatly.]
 [Your disciple Dao Sovereign was attacked by demons] x8093321
 (Your disciple Zhao Xuanyuan was attacked by a mysterious demon and was severely injured.]
 (Your good friend Jiang Yi was attacked by demons] X72110034
 (Your good friend Pan Xin was attacked by your good friend Di Jiang and was severely injured.)
 (Your disciple Su Qi has successfully attained the Dao and attained the Primordial Chaos Dao Fruit. His providence has increased greatly.)
 The Great Dao Sages in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End indeed knew how to behave. They actually took turns to guide the Evil Heavenly Emperor and the others to get closer.
 This time, Han Jue couldn’t do anything to them.
 He could only hope that these Great Dao Sages would not stab him in the back in the future.
  Otherwise, it would be useless even if they begged for mercy!
 Oh, Ancestor.
 He had gone astray.
 However, this was also good. It was more convenient for Han Jue to slander the First Life Black Sovereign.
 Further down, there was no surprise in Su Qi’s Dao attainment. After all, he controlled the providence of the netherworld.
 After reading the emails, Han Jue began to observe the Immortal World.
 After ten thousand years, the Immortal World developed better and better. Han Jue noticed that the number of Zenith Heaven Golden Immortals and Pseudo-Sages had also increased.
 It was a little strange.
 He counted with his fingers and came to a realization.
 It turned out that these cultivators had all gone to listen to the Great Dao Sage’s lecture.
 The Great Dao Sages in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End were determined to befriend the Heavenly Dao. To be precise, they wanted to befriend Han Jue.
 Too obvious.
 However, Han Jue didn’t want to reply for the time being. He just wanted to let nature take its course.
 Although he could kill these Great Dao Sages, they were still a powerful force. It would naturally be a good thing if they could help the Heavenly Dao.
 At this moment.
 Li Xuan’ao came to visit and Han Jue let him in.
 Just like before, Li Xuan’ao first reported the development of the Hidden Sect. However, he was very excited this time, and the admiration in his eyes could not be hidden.
 After reporting the basic situation, Li Xuan’ao couldn’t help but ask, “Sect Master, have you already surpassed the Great Dao Sages?”
 Clearly, he had already heard of Han Jue’s achievements. After all, there was the Myriad Worlds Projection.
 Han Jue said, “I’m still a Great Dao Sage, but my methods are powerful.”
 Li Xuan’ao began to flatter him.
 Han Jue frowned impatiently, scaring him so much that he hurriedly stopped.
 “Now, more than ten factions in the Chaos have expressed their intention to befriend the Hidden Sect through Zhou Fan. They are even willing to preach the Dao to the Hidden Sect disciples. However, I feel that this is not appropriate. After all, the low-level disciples don’t know your battle achievements and have received the favor of others for no reason. They might change sides, so I rejected them one by one,” Li Xuan’ao said seriously.
 Han Jue nodded slightly.
 This kid was not overwhelmed by surprise.
 Then, he mentioned the descendants of Pangu. The Hidden Sect had accepted many. He hoped that Han Jue could preach the Dao when he was free and win the hearts of the people. Han Jue agreed.
 After Li Xuan’ao left, Han Jue continued to observe the Immortal World. His gaze gradually landed on the Chaotic Heavenly Road.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du’s voice sounded in Han Jue’s ears. He had looked for him thousands of years ago. Han Jue rejected him when he heard that he was not in a hurry and said that he would go after his seclusion ended.
 Han Jue looked at Life in the Primordial Heavenly Prison and decided to send a soul fragment to the 33rd Heaven in case Life tried to escape.
 After all, Life was also a Great Dao Sage. If he escaped, all the Hidden Sect disciples in the Hundred Peak Immortal River would die.
 Just like that, Han Jue’s soul fragment entered the Universal Hall. It looked no different from the main body.
 The Sages had already arrived. Su Qi was also present. Only Li Daokong and Shi Dudao had yet to return.
  “Master!”
 Han Jue nodded. He noticed that all the Sages were looking at him with reverence.
 Including Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du!
 Clearly, the battle of the Heavenly Court was already known by the Heavenly Dao Sages.
 After the Sages sat down, Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “Recently, with the cooperation of the Great Dao Sages, the Chaotic Heavenly Road has developed better and better. The Heavenly Dao’s providence has also strengthened and two new Sage spots have been born. One has been occupied by Fellow Daoist Su Qi, and the other has yet to be decided. We will discuss the Sage position today, but it’s not the main thing.
 well.”


 First Life Black Sovereign was too daring!
 In the battle of the Heavenly Court, he had lost a total of fifteen Lives. Other than the thirteen Lives killed by Han Jue, there was also the Life who used his Dark Instinct and the one who provoked the Heavenly Court at the beginning
 After provoking the Heavenly Court, Han Jue secretly left it to the Evil Heavenly Emperor before leaving
 Logically speaking, under normal circumstances, after suffering such a heavy loss, one should rest for a period of time. However, the First Life Black Sovereign was different. He was even more blatant and fearless.
 Also…
 The appearance of Life should be considered destroying the Chaos. Why did it not offend the Chaotic Consciousness?
  Could it be that in the eyes of the Chaotic Consciousness, they were no threat at all?
 It was very likely!
 No matter what, the First Life Black Sovereign was still defeated by Pangu. The Dark Forbidden Lord was different. Ever since his reputation rose, he had never lost. Even the Chaotic Consciousness could not determine who he was.
 Perhaps the Chaotic Consciousness already knew that Han Jue might be the Dark Forbidden Lord, but he was still uncertain.
 Han Jue thought silently and understood.
 Qiu Xilai said, “As long as they don’t threaten the Heavenly Dao, there’s no need to care about them. Although many Great Dao Sages have befriended the Heavenly Dao, the foundation of the Heavenly Dao is still too weak. The most important thing now is to develop the Heavenly Dao and not be taken over by the Great Dao Sages.”
 Pan Xin said, “I was attacked by Di Jiang when I was returning. He wanted to snatch my Heaven-Opening Axe. How detestable.”
 His expression was calm. He was not furious.
 He had been surrounded by a group of Great Dao Sages in the past and had still fought his way out. How could the twelve Ancestral Magi stop him?
 The other Sages were silent, not knowing what to say.
 It was already a consensus to cooperate with the Great Dao Sages in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End. The conflict between Pan Xin and Di Jiang was only about Pangu’s lineage and could not break the consensus.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “In that case, let’s not care about Life for the time being. The Chaotic Heavenly Road should connect to more Chaotic Worlds. This way, the providence of the Heavenly Dao will increase faster. In addition, you can create a mortal world outside the Heavenly Dao. The Immortal World will still be the center of the Heavenly Dao in the future. When the Heavenly Dao covers the Chaos, the Immortal World will be the center of the Chaos…”
 He began to talk about the plan, making the Sages excited.
 An hour later, they began to discuss the new Sage position.
 Han Jue didn’t participate. It didn’t affect him no matter who obtained it.
 However, he noticed that Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du seemed to want this spot.
 Apart from Han Jue’s protection, Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du had contributed the most to the Heavenly Dao today. He had always been diligent and rarely raised his needs.
 Han Jue had a good impression of him and said, “Give it to the Human School. Fellow Daoist Xuan Du has contributed so much. The Human School should also be promoted. In the future, every providence sect will have more than one Heavenly Dao Sage. The Heavenly Dao Sage Realm is no longer our highest demand. I see that your cultivation levels are increasing. It’s not wishful thinking to attain the Freedom Realm.”
 The moment he spoke, the Sages did not dare to have any objections. At the same time, they began to look forward to his words.
 They would have scoffed at others if they said this.
 However, Han Jue was a Great Dao Sage!
 In the eyes of the Great Dao Sages, what was a Freedom Sage?
 For a time, the Sages began to support Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du and even flatter him.
 At this moment, Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du would not reject. He immediately agreed and thanked Han Jue.
 As a new Sage, Su Qi silently watched all of this. He only had one feeling. Master controlled everything!
 After the Sage Meeting ended, Han Jue’s soul fragment dissipated.
 He continued to cultivate.
 Five thousand years passed quickly.
 [Primordial Heavenly Prison has successfully enslaved the target.)
 [Great Sage Void Soul (Life) has a favorable impression of you. Current favorability: Max.]
 Han Jue opened his eyes and frowned.
 It took him 15,000 years!
 He immediately checked the profile picture of Great Sage Void Soul.
 (Great Sage Void Soul: Late-stage Great Dao Primordial Chaos Realm, Tribulation Calamity Life Controller, Chaotic Lifeform. After attaining the Great Dao, he was attacked by a Great Dao Divine Spirit and was suppressed at the edge of the Chaos. Later, he was saved by the First Life Black Sovereign and turned into Life. Current favorability: Max.]
 Tsk tsk, another mighty figure with a tragic
 past.
 Great Sage Void Soul opened his eyes and knelt down.
 Han Jue asked, “Tell me everything you know about Life.”
 Great Sage Void Soul immediately told the truth.
 Currently, the First Life Black Sovereign had already developed more than fifty Lives. Half of them were Great Dao Sages. These Great Dao Sages were all expelled by the Chaos or existences who hated the Chaos.
 Below Life were the Dark Life Soldiers. There were countless of them. They were all races that had been suppressed by the Chaos.
 Above Life and below the First Life Black Sovereign were seven Divine Lives. They were extremely mysterious and were said to be existences even older than the Heavenly Dao.
 Great Sage Void Soul did not have a deep understanding of the Life faction. He didn’t even know where the First Life Black Sovereign was hiding.
 “What’s the Life Lord hiding from?” Han Jue asked.
 Life Lord was the First Life Black Sovereign.
 Great Sage Void Soul frowned and said, “I’m not sure, either. I’ve only seen him once. He mentioned a name, Primordial Fiendcelestial.”
 Han Jue narrowed his eyes. “Is there really a Primordial Fiendcelestial hidden in the Chaos?”
 Han Jue fell into deep thought.
 He asked again, “If I let you go now, do you think you can still infiltrate the Life faction?”
  Great Sage Void Soul shook his head. “No, Life Lord has already sensed my betrayal.”
 Han Jue could only give up. He let Great Sage Void Soul go out and find a place to cultivate. He would stay in the Hundred Peak Immortal River in the future and not tell anyone his true identity. He would say that he was a Dao Field guard.
 Great Sage Void Soul was a Great Dao Sage, after all. He could protect the Heavenly Dao in the future.
 As for the second Dao Field, Han Jue still had to maintain his original thoughts.
 Only the Chaotic Fiendcelestials could stay in the second Dao Field!
 Han Jue asked in his mind, “I want to know if there is another Primordial Fiendcelestial other than me, including the blank domain outside the Chaos.”
 This time, his lifespan was not deducted.


 Han Jue showed a frown.
 He recalled the words of the future Fang Liang. The future Fang Liang wanted to lure him into the blank domain to avoid the Chaotic Deities’ pursuit.
 Was he trying to harm him?
 No!
 Fang Liang had already been tamed by the Primordial Heavenly Prison. He would not harm Han Jue. That meant he was being used by someone.
 Just like the Evil Heavenly Emperor from before, he was used by the Great Dao Concealment Fiendcelestial to lure Han Jue out.
  However, Han Jue already knew about this. There would definitely be changes in the future.
 Thinking of the calamity, Han Jue had to derive it.
 “I want to know how long I have until the Great Dao Calamity.”
 (1 trillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [About 18.9 billion years.]
 Crap!
 It sped up!
 Was it because he had killed Life earlier?
 Han Jue continued to ask, “Who pushed the process of the Great Dao Calamity?”
 (500 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 A line of words appeared in front of Han Jue. It was the other party’s information introduction.
 First Life Black Sovereign!
 Han Jue frowned again.
 Apart from him, the others could also push for the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity forward. This was not good.
 Didn’t that mean that the time calculated by the system was not certain?
 Should he think of a way to get rid of First Life Black Sovereign?
 No, no one would take the blame if he got rid of that guy.
 Han Jue fell into deep thought.
 After a long while…
 Han Jue’s voice resounded throughout the Hundred Peak Immortal River, “All disciples, prepare to listen to the Dao.”
 Because of the addition of new disciples, Han Jue still informed them in advance.
 With that said, the Hundred Peak Immortal River boiled over!
 Especially the new hundred thousand disciples, they were full of fantasies about Han Jue.
 Five minutes later, Han Jue began to preach the Dao. The Great Dao of Extreme Origin covered the entire Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 This lecture lasted for two hundred years.
 Even Great Sage Void Soul gained enlightenment.
 After the lecture, Han Jue directly entered cultivation.
 His goal was to be on par with the Chaotic Deities and truly dominate the Chaos!
 The Chaos was endless. The Chaotic Heavenly Road traversed the darkness.
 At this moment, Han Yu and Qin Ling met on a section of the Chaotic Heavenly Road.
 Qin Ling was very excited and knelt in front of Han Yu.
 Han Yu smiled and helped him up. The two of them began to exchange pleasantries.
 The current Great Dao Tower was already considered a subsidiary force of the Hidden Sect. In order to cultivate in peace, Zhou Fan asked Li Xuan’ao to send a large number of cultivators who were good at government management to control it. The Great Dao Tower did not resist, especially after the battle of the Heavenly Court. They were looking forward to joining the Hidden Sect.
 Anyone who joined the Great Dao Tower was someone with no fixed residence. With a stronger backing, why not?
 Han Yu said, “I know your connections and ability, so I came to you. To be honest, I learned that my master, Li Daokong, has been missing for a long time. I’ve visited the Sages, and they said that they don’t know where he is. I’m a little worried. Although my master is a Sage, he’s still very tiny in the Chaos. I’m worried that something has happened to him.”
 As the Chaotic Heavenly Road flourished, the living beings of the Heavenly Dao also understood more and more about the Chaos.
 The Chaos was too big!
 Not to mention the Heavenly Dao, even the Dark Forbidden Zone only occupied a small portion of the Chaos. Until now, no one knew how big the Chaos was. Some mighty figures even believed that the Chaos was endless and limitless.
 Sages might be supreme in a small corner of the Heavenly Dao, but they were definitely no different from mortals in the Chaos.
 There were still many dangerous places hidden in the Chaos. Even Sages would die if they accidentally entered.
 To Han Yu, Li Daokong was not as simple as his master. He was more like his father.
 Qin Ling frowned. He could understand him. If Han Yu was missing, he would definitely take the risk to find him.
 “This is very important. Why don’t I bring you to see the master of the Great Dao Tower? He’s also a disciple of the Hidden Sect. It’s said that he has an extremely good relationship with the ancestor,” Qin Ling said in a low voice.
 Han Yu nodded. They immediately moved.
 On the way, Qin Ling asked where his master, Tian Yong, was.
 Han Yu said helplessly, “He has long stepped onto the Chaotic Heavenly Road. I don’t know where he went. He might be dead.”
 Qin Ling didn’t ask further. He didn’t like Tian Yong. His master had never taught him anything
 The Heavenly Dao lifeforms heading to the Chaos were already immeasurable. The Heavenly Dao was spreading its branches at an extremely exaggerated speed. The place where the Heavenly Dao lifeforms stopped would soon form the providence of the Heavenly Dao and expand its territory.
 Ten thousand years passed in the blink of an
 eye.
 Han Jue’s life fell into peace again. No one disturbed him. Li Daokong, who was hiding in the Life faction, didn’t use the Invocation Technique either. He was probably not in danger for the time being.
 In the past few years, another Heavenly Dao Sage had been born in the Immortal World. He was from the Human School and was called Li Taigu.
 The Human School’s momentum increased greatly and they recruited many disciples.
 The current Immortal World could be said to be in full bloom. There were no absolute providence sects or races.
 After leaving the Heavenly Dao, no matter what race they were, as long as they were Heavenly Dao lifeforms, they would feel even more intimate.
 For this, Pan Xin even specially established the Heavenly Road Patrol Army, all of them Pangu’s descendants.
 Relying on the name of the Sage Pangu, Pan Xin roped in most of the descendants and established the Pangu Race.
 Han Jue started to check his emails.
 Some people obtained opportunities, some were still being beaten, and some friends lit up the name of the new map. It was still interesting, but no email was worth Han Jue’s special attention.
 After reading the emails, Han Jue stood up and went to Xing Hongxuan’s Daoist temple next door.
 Xing Hongxuan was still cultivating. Her cultivation level had already reached the late-stage Pseudo-Sage Realm.
 This speed had already surpassed that of a personal disciple. Han Jue suspected that she had stolen her son’s talent.
 Han Jue’s visit made Xing Hongxuan very happy. The two of them sat on the bed and started chatting
  Xing Hongxuan was very excited and proudly talked about her cultivation speed.
 She felt that she would attain the Dao in another hundred thousand years.
 Han Jue asked, “Will it burden you if the child is never born?”
 Xing Hongxuan smiled. “No, the longer he’s nurtured, the stronger his potential. In any case, he can help me cultivate even if he’s not born.”
 She began to touch her womb with a sweet expression. She felt like her son was being filial to her.
 Han Jue was speechless.
 This woman was really cheerful. Not bad.
 He didn’t tell her the truth, lest Xing Hongxuan worry.


 He called the Black Hell Chicken, Xun Chang’an, the Eight Calabash Brothers, Ah Da, Xiao Er, the Chaotic Heavenly Dog, the Three-Headed Wyrm King, and Tu Ling’er into the Daoist temple.
 The personal disciples quickly arrived. All of them were nervous, but they couldn’t hide their surprise.
 As Han Jue became stronger, their status increased. However, the distance between them and him also increased. This was something that couldn’t be helped. However, they were still loyal to Han Jue and knew that something good had happened when he called them over.
 When one attained the Dao, even his chickens and dogs would ascend to heaven!
 Han Jue would not forget them.
  On the path of cultivation, he would not care about those who gave up on him.
 However, if they kept following him, he would definitely not ignore them.
 Not only these people, but there were also the Black Hell Demon Lord, Diamond Rage, the Nether Race, and the others. Han Jue would also take care of them, but it had to be after these people. The order was important.
 Murong Qi, Li Yao, Great Loose Heaven, and Guan Bubai were all missing. They couldn’t even be seen in the Myriad Worlds Projection. Especially Murong Qi. The personal disciples all knew that Han Jue doted on him. If something happened to this kid, Han Jue wouldn’t ignore it. There could only be one reason.
 Han Jue was hiding them! The Black Hell Chicken asked, “Our potential is limited. Perhaps we can use Master’s prestige to attain the Dao. In the future, we might not be able to keep up with you.”
 It sounded pitiful, but it was also reality.
 “Let’s cultivate to the perfected Pseudo-Sage Realm first.”
 With that, Han Jue started to preach the Dao. The Great Dao of Extreme Origin surged into their minds.
 Ten years later.
 They had just left the Daoist temple, all of them looking forward to the future.
 In a dark domain, countless bones floated like a white mist.
 A lone island floated. A black shadow was sitting under an old tree.
 Upon a careful look, the black shadow was only surrounded by a black aura. As the black aura surged, he revealed an extremely ugly face. Many poisonous bugs crawled on his face. He wore a black robe and his chest was white bones.
 A beam of light descended from above and landed in front of the black-robed man. The wind that stirred up shook the island. The branches of the old tree shook violently, but no leaves fell.
 The black-robed man slowly said, “Why are you always so noisy? Don’t you find it noisy?” The beam of light dissipated and a mighty figure appeared. He laughed wantonly. “Hahaha. Curse Fiendcelestial, I saw that your place was cold and came to cheer you up.”
 This black-robed man was the Curse Fiendcelestial who had already transformed.
 The Curse Fiendcelestial said calmly, “You’re a Great Dao Divine Spirit. Can you be more serious?”
 “You just suppressed the Ancient Desolate not long ago. Although some tough people escaped, it’s still considered peaceful. I remember that you told me before that you only have two enemies. One is the Dark Forbidden Lord and the other is the Heavenly Dao’s Han Jue?” The purple-robed burly man asked, his smile fading.
 The Curse Fiendcelestial nodded.
 The purple-robed man said, “Some time ago, Han Jue killed fourteen Lives and Despair Dao Spirit. Did you hear that?”
 The Curse Fiendcelestial nodded again, but its expression was unnatural. The poisonous bugs on its face also stopped.
 “This child’s background is mysterious. He also killed a deity and violated the rules of the Chaos. Most importantly, he wants to strengthen the Heavenly Dao. According to the development of the Heavenly Dao, he will definitely change the Chaos in the future. This is not a good thing. I plan to destroy the Heavenly Dao. Are you willing to help me? At that time, I will let you kill Han Jue personally.” The purple-robed burly man snorted.
 The Curse Fiendcelestial frowned. “I’m not his match.”
 Hatred flashed across his eyes.
 He didn’t hate Han Jue, but Divine Lord Peacock.
 That fool was toxic and kept chasing after him.
 The Curse Fiendcelestial hesitated for a moment before nodding. He had no choice.
 The purple-robed man raised his hand and a figure appeared beside him. It was an illusion.
 “This is Laozi, the strongest person in the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End. He saved the Heavenly Sect Master. I want you to curse him.” The purple-robed man introduced him.
 The Curse Fiendcelestial said, “Laozi is an existence that surpasses the Great Dao Sages. My cultivation level is too low. I might not be able to hurt him.”
 “It’s fine. You can learn from the Dark Forbidden Lord. Even if you can’t hurt him, it’ll still make him vexed and unable to cultivate.”
 “Fine.”
 The Curse Fiendcelestial agreed helplessly.
 The purple-robed man grinned. “Oh you, you still have to cultivate well. You’re far inferior to the Dark Forbidden Lord. No one will believe that you’re the Curse Fiendcelestial. How can your Great Dao be led by others?”
 The Curse Fiendcelestial said, “I know. Are you going to preach again?”.
 “Hahaha, that’s all. I’ll help you kill Han Jue first and help you find the Dark Forbidden Lord in the future. It just so happens that the Chaotic Deities are also looking for him. If you have any clues, inform me at any time. This is a great merit!”
 “Understood.”
 The purple-robed man vanished.
 The Curse Fiendcelestial’s brows relaxed. A cold glint flashed across his eyes. Then, he closed his eyes and continued cultivating.
 …
 Time passed quickly. Another ten thousand years passed.
 Han Jue’s cultivation improved again, but he was still far from breaking through.
 He had the urge to enter seclusion for a million years.
 If he really did, it would be like a dream.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and habitually checked his emails before observing the Immortal World.
 He didn’t want to find that the Heavenly Dao collapsed the moment he woke up.
 No one had died in his circle of friends. Han Jue already had many friends, but not many people could enter his circle of friends and be placed under special attention.
  The development of the Heavenly Dao was also very smooth, even a little fast. In tens of thousands of years, there would probably be two more Sages. Han Jue noticed something.
 There was an additional aura of Freedom outside the 33rd Heaven.
 It was Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du.
 Han Jue continued to observe the Heavenly Dao.
 Soon, he discovered something else.
 Primordial Origin’s coffin and the Primordial Chaos Tablet were gone.
 Although Primordial Origin and Huang Zuntian had fused previously, the coffin and the Primordial Chaos Tablet had always been left outside the netherworld. It was not only these two things. Huang Zuntian was also not in the Heavenly Dao.
