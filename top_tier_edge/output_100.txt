Chapter 1096 Appearance
“I’ll be your match!”
Ji Xianshen raised his sword and stood in front of Laozi, his arrogance soaring.
Laozi held the horsetail whisk in his hand and
stroked his beard. “You, who stole the space-time of fate, took the wrong path. Aren’t you going to repent?”
Ji Xianshen had transmigrated to the past and challenged Laozi. With Laozi’s cultivation, he could naturally sense it and even
counterattack. If not for Han Jue, he would have directly crossed space and time to kill Ji Xianshen.
Laozi did not say anything else. The two of them transformed into two sword lights and soared into the sky. They killed their way to the peak of the Chaos and began the battle.
The Chaos had more Great Dao Supremes, but the Primordial Chaos Great Dao Supremes were all very strong. For example, Dao Sovereign, Zhao Xuanyuan, Jiang Yi, Murong Qi, and the other Hidden Sect disciples had all proved themselves in the Chaotic Assembly.
Not only that, but as the chaotic battle began, more and more Great Dao Supremes joined.
In the Myriad Worlds Projection.
The Chaotic Heavenly Dog appeared and said, “We’re calling for help! Hurry up and teleport over to reinforce them!”
With that, the dozens of figures waiting in the Myriad Worlds Projection stood up. They were all Chaotic Fiendcelestials of the second Dao Field.
Guan Bubai laughed. “Finally! Kill! The Hidden Sect must dominate everything in this
Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity!”
The other Chaotic Fiendcelestials also
laughed.
The Chaotic Heavenly Dog urged, “Stop
pretending. Hurry up!”
Dozens of Chaotic Fiendcelestials immediately
teleported to Murong Qi’s side.
At the same time.
In the Chaos, the Great Dao Sages of the Primordial Chaos each sent hundreds of millions of Primordial Demon Soldiers and Primordial lifeforms in different directions. The worlds along the way were destroyed by them, and all the living beings they encountered were destroyed in body and soul. Tragedy and despair were spreading in the Chaos.
Han Huang had yet to appear.
In the Consciousnessless Domain.
A figure broke through the ground at the bottom of the Chaos and flew out with countless figures. This figure was peerlessly divine. His aura was world-shattering, like a war god who had stepped from the end of fate. His golden armor shone with Great Dao divine patterns as if countless figures were meditating and chanting.
“Hmph! Han Huang, don’t be arrogant. Do you really think you’re invincible in the
world?”
The golden-armored divine shadow snorted coldly. His voice was also domineering, resounding throughout the Chaos.
On another side.
An endless sea of blood surged out from Shi Tian and swept through the void, spreading towards the Chaotic Battlefield.
In a sea of blood.
A man with a bare upper body and a lower body that was like blood. He fused with the sea of blood and his long hair fluttered wantonly. His cold and evil face was filled
with fighting spirit. The two eyes on his forehead were like blood crystals that vaguely emitted a black light.
“Primordial Fiendcelestial? I want to see it,”
the four-eyed man in the sea of blood muttered to himself, his eyes filled with
killing intent.
The sea of blood moved faster and faster, vaguely expanding.
Transcendent Domain.
The mighty Creation Emperor Court army was
advancing in the void. Han Ye, Han Yao, and Han Bashen were the three leaders. They
walked at the very front. Countless Emperor God Immortals marched behind them, as well as many majestic flying Dharma treasures, spirit beasts, and ferocious beasts.
Han Yao sighed. “This aura is really strong. I didn’t expect so many Great Dao Supremes to be hidden in the Chaos.”
Han Bashen said, “Although the Ultimate Evil Chaotic Devils slaughtered all living beings, the mighty figures did not lose much. Furthermore, geniuses kept rising.” Han Ye stared ahead coldly.
Han Yao noticed his gaze and teased,
Han Ye and Han Huang had once fought side by side. Furthermore, the two of them were similar and often discussed the Dao together.
Han Ye couldn’t accept Han Huang’s betrayal the most.
“Hmph, how is that possible! I’ve always wanted to defeat him!”
Han Ye couldn’t be bothered by him and snorted.
Immediately, an endless stream of factions
from the various Great Dao Worlds rushed to
the battlefield, wanting to contain the Primordial Chaos.
This battle was unprecedented. The space at
the edge of the Chaos had already begun to crack.
In the Ancient Primordial World, purple Qi was like a sea.
Huang Zuntian was sitting down. Bones
gathered around him, forming a circle. To be precise, it was Primordial Origin.
He had already possessed Huang Zuntian’s body and suppressed his soul.
Primordial Origin opened his eyes and
muttered with a burning gaze, “Han Huang, it seems that you’re really a Primordial Fiendcelestial. So, I failed because of you.” He raised his right hand, and the shadow of
Huang Zuntian’s soul appeared on his palm. “Tell me, what should we do in this Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity?” Primordial Origin looked down at him and asked.
Huang Zuntian looked up at him and snorted.
“Is my opinion important?”
“I suddenly want to support Han Huang.”
“Yo, you’re very rational. If the two Primordial Fiendcelestials join forces and
stop the Chaotic trend of killing him?” Huang Zuntian mocked. Primordial Origin ignored his emotions and nodded in agreement. “The Primordial Fiendcelestial battle is not now. It will be in the Endless Era in the
future. In that case, let’s help Han Huang together.”
“When are we leaving?”
“Let’s wait a little longer. We will bring the second wave of despair after Han Huang.” “Could it be that there’s a power in the Chaos that can turn the tide?”
“Don’t underestimate the Chaos. A
mysterious existence must be manipulating all of this in the background. Think about it carefully and you should be able to sense it.’
Huang Zuntian was silent and fell into deep thought.
Primordial Origin suddenly smiled. “It’s time for the show.”
A screen of light appeared in front of him, projecting the Chaotic War.
Huang Zuntian looked over. Tens of thousands of Divine Authority Generals had appeared above the three thousand Great Dao. They were equivalent to tens of thousands of top Great Dao Sages!
Compared to when he faced the Divine Might
Generals was naturally the Ultimate God of Punishment.
The Ultimate God of Punishment brought dozens of ancient Great Dao Divine Spirits over to reverse the situation and suppress the Primordial Chaos.
In the third Dao Field.
Han Jue was also watching the battle. However, this Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity had just begun. It would probably last for a long time.
Han Jue lost interest after watching for a while.
Cultivation was more important.
He had to hurry up and break through to the Creator Lord Realm.
He looked at the blank domain. The Purity Great Dao World was getting closer
and closer to the Ultimate Origin World. The Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity did not stop it. He was clearly prepared to sacrifice his Great Dao World to fulfill his wish.
This way, it was very difficult to hide the fact that the Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity had joined Han Jue. Even if the Dao Creators thought that he was coercing him, they knew that once the Purity Great Dao World was devoured, the Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity would have to listen to him.
Han Jue smiled and closed his eyes.
On the other side.
In a mysterious domain.
The Formless Transcendent Deity met the Evil
Heavenly Emperor.
“I’m prepared to help Han Huang,” the Formless Transcendent Deity said.
The Evil Heavenly Emperor was shocked.
“You…” “There’s no need to explain. This is also your intention, right?” “Thank you,
you, senior!”
The Evil Heavenly Emperor took a deep breath and thanked him in a low voice.
He supported Han Huang not only because of their relationship but also because he really felt that Han Huang had a higher chance of winning.


 As the Creation Emperor Court headed to the Chaotic Battlefield to reinforce the Chaos.
 In the Transcendent Domain.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor began to rearrange the army.
 On the other side.
 Heavenly Dao.
 More than a thousand Heavenly Dao Sages gathered in the Universal Hall. Every one of them had a solemn expression.
 Qiu Xilai snorted. “The battle between the Chaos and the Primordial Chaos is already unstoppable. The Hidden Sect supports the Primordial Chaos. The Heavenly Dao should also make a choice. I think we should support the Primordial Chaos. Don’t forget how the Heavenly Dao rose. If not for the Hidden Sect, do you think the Chaos will support the Heavenly Dao? When the Primordial Chaos fails, won’t the Chaos suppress and even destroy the Heavenly Dao?”
 His words were supported by the older generation of Sages. Only they knew how difficult it was for the Heavenly Dao to survive in the Chaos in the past.
 If not for the Divine Might Heavenly Sage’s help, the Heavenly Dao would have been destroyed countless times over.
 However, the new Sages did not think so. They had never seen the Divine Might Heavenly Sage on their path of growth. They only felt that the Hidden Sect was powerful.
 A Sage said, “But Han Huang wants to destroy all living beings in the Chaos. This is a huge sin!”
 His words attracted the agreement of many Sages.
 “That’s right. Han Huang is so cruel. If the Heavenly Dao helps him, isn’t that equivalent to not being able to tell right from wrong?”
 “The past is the past. If we help Han Huang today and he wants to destroy the Heavenly Dao in the future, who will help us then?”
 “That’s right. We can’t lose our morals. We can’t follow blindly just to survive.”
 “Sages should use their Sage Heart to survive. How can they not know right from wrong?”
 “Han Huang didn’t say if he will let the Heavenly Dao go. Could it be that we have to
 beg him?”
 The new Sages became more and more excited
 Huang.
 Heavenly Venerate Wufa frowned and looked displeased.
 Han Yunjin listened as they went overboard
 and even began to impeach the Hidden Sect and the Han family. He also became unhappy. Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du had no choice but to say, “The Heavenly Dao is actually also a Great Dao World and doesn’t belong to the Chaos. You have to think carefully. What will happen to the Heavenly Dao if Han Huang wins?”
 The new Sages became restless.
 They subconsciously thought that Han Huang
 would lose.
 Since ancient times, evil could not defeat
 good. Such a philosophy was something they had accepted since they were born. In
 addition, the Heavenly Dao had not encountered a calamity that came close to
 destroying them for a long time. They were too idealistic and advocated the so-called morality used to control mortals.
 After all, the new Sages had also grown up from mortals.
 Pan Xin smiled sinisterly. “In that case, the Heavenly Dao might as well be divided into two camps. One supports Han Huang, and the other supports the Chaos. No matter who wins or loses, the Heavenly Dao can maintain its inheritance.”
 The new Sages were silent.
 They weren’t stupid. They could tell that the
 older generation of Sages wanted to support Han Huang.
 In the Heavenly Dao, the new and old factions
 were not only divided by age, but also by strength. The strength of the older generation of Sages far exceeded the new Sages.
 A Sage stood up and asked, “What makes you
 think Han Huang can win? Because he’s the Divine Might Heavenly Sage’s son? Don’t forget, the Divine Might Heavenly Sage also has descendants in the Creation Emperor Court. The legendary Emperor is even his biological daughter!
 “Perhaps the Divine Might Heavenly Sage won’t interfere in the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity. Han Huang will be our master if we support the Primordial Chaos. Think about what Han Huang can
 bring to the Heavenly Dao and not blindly revere the Divine Might Heavenly Sage!” This statement was supported by many new
 Sages. In their opinion, the older generation trusted the Divine Might Heavenly Sage too much. To put it bluntly, they were afraid. Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “Then let’s wait and see for now. However, you have to
 know one thing. If Han Huang obtains an advantage and the Heavenly Dao helps him, the reward will naturally be less.”
 This plan was supported by the new Sages. As
 for what he had to say, they did not care. Compared to repayment, they wanted to protect their current power and lives more.
 Boom! Boom! Boom…
 The three thousand Great Dao were shaken
 chaotic.
 The Great Dao Supremes fought intensely.
 The Great Dao Sages also led a large group to kill. There were more than a million battlefields of all sizes in the entire Chaos.
 Han Ye held the World Piercing Divine Origin Bow and killed a million Primordial Demon Soldiers with a single arrow. It was unstoppable.
 Dao Sovereign appeared and blocked his path.
 Han Ye recognized him. “Senior, does the
 Hidden Sect really want to support Han
 Huang? Is this your intention or the progenitor’s?” Dao Sovereign smiled. “My master is busy in
 seclusion and won’t care about the Chaos. You
 don’t have to feel pressured. In the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity, just fight for yourself. No matter which side you’re fighting
 for, it’s a fight for creation.”
 Han
 Ye heaved a sigh of relief upon hearing that Han Jue wouldn’t interfere. Although he hadn’t seen the progenitor for a
 long time, in his heart, Han Jue had always
 been the existence he admired the most. If not for this progenitor, he would have long fallen into the cycle of reincarnation. How could he have his current status?
 “Let me see the Ultimate Dao Treasure Master gave you!”
 Dao Sovereign raised his hand, and the
 Dharma idol of the Great Dao World appeared behind him.
 Han Ye smiled mysteriously. “My bow
 specializes in restraining Great Dao Worlds. Senior, be careful.”
 “Is that so? Then I want to see if you can break through my Great Dao World!” Dao Sovereign smiled proudly. His eyes
 narrowed as he moved Han Ye into his Great Dao World.
 His Great Dao World only had rules and no
 living beings. It was often used by him to fight.
 On the other side. Han Yao faced Jiang Yi.
 Zhao Xuanyuan faced Han Bashen.
 …
 A figure tore through space and appeared under the Seven Supreme Rules.
 It was the Nine-Headed Divine Spirit.
 He wore a black robe with flames at the edge.
 Only his head was revealed. His face was cold and looked quite similar to Zhao Xuanyuan. Nine black crystals floated above his head and
 spun on their own, emitting an endless black
 aura.
 The Nine-Headed Divine Spirit looked down at the chaotic battle below and sneered. “A
 group of worms should shake the Chaos. Come out!”
 The black mist around him suddenly entered
 a Supreme Rule. The Supreme Rule fluctuated and gradually condensed into a figure. It was the previous leader of the Divine
 Spirits, the Primordial Ancestor God!
 The Ultimate God of Punishment, who was controlling the Divine Authority Generals to fight, seemed to sense something and
 suddenly looked up. He was stunned when he saw the Primordial Ancestor God.
 “How can this be?!”
 The Ultimate God of Punishment revealed a
 look of disbelief. He had personally killed the Primordial Ancestor God. How could he revive?
 The Primordial Ancestor God raised his hands
 and checked his body. He muttered, “Long time no see…”
 He noticed the gaze of the Ultimate God of Punishment, but he was disdainful of him. If not for the Dark Forbidden Lord, he would
 not have cared about the Ultimate God of Punishment at all.
 to the Nine-Headed Divine Spirit. “Thank you
 for your help.”
 The Nine-Headed Divine Spirit said expressionlessly, “Kill the worms that want to destroy the Chaos!”
 “Alright!”
 The Primordial Ancestor God walked down. There seemed to be an invisible staircase under his feet. In an instant, the Seven
 Supreme Rules trembled in unison and shot
 out their power, landing on the Primordial
 Ancestor God.
 The Divine Spirits’ true leader had returned!


 The Primordial Ancestor God had taken less than five steps when the power of the Seven Supreme Rules all added to him, causing his aura to reach its peak, and startling the entire battlefield. The Great Dao Supremes of both sides looked up.
 Some Great Dao Divine Spirits were moved and revealed looks of disbelief.
 “He’s indeed still alive…”
 The Holy Mother of Order looked up at the dazzling Primordial Ancestor God and thought.
 The Primordial Ancestor God looked at the tens of thousands of Divine Authority
 Generals before looking at the Ultimate God of Punishment.
 “He stole my Deity Position and stole my divine generals. He really deserves to die!”
 The Primordial Ancestor God snorted and waved his hand. Terrifying Dharmic powers erupted. The supreme power was like a heavenly river that overturned and drowned the Ultimate God of Punishment.
 The Ultimate God of Punishment condensed his armor and raised his hand to point. A black pillar of light shot out. Two powerful Dharmic powers collided, causing the space to lose its color. A terrifying storm overturned the Great Dao Supremes.
 The battle between the new and old leaders of the Divine Spirits was also a blood feud.
 “All of you, continue to destroy the
 Primordial Chaos. I will personally deal with this evil devil!” the Ultimate God of Punishment shouted angrily. He displayed his true sharpness at this moment.
 He rarely took personal action ever since he took over. He had almost forgotten that he was also warlike.
 With that, the Great Dao Supremes of the Chaos continued to attack the Primordial Chaos.
 The Primordial Ancestor God was shocked as he fought the Ultimate God of Punishment. He discovered that this fellow could actually mobilize the power of the Supreme Rules. How was this possible?
 He hadn’t passed the Deity Position to him.
 He couldn’t help but look at the Nine-Headed
 Divine Spirit. Could it be him?
 Little did he know that the Nine-Headed
 Divine Spirit also had mixed emotions.
 He also fell into the mortal world after the
 Primordial Ancestor God died. Only one
 existence could give the Deity Position to the Nine-Headed Divine Spirit.
 The Nine-Headed Divine Spirit did not dare to
 think about that existence.
 The Ultimate God of Punishment and the
 Primordial Ancestor God fought. It was difficult to tell who was stronger. Both sides
 grasped the power of the Supreme Rules, and the Mystical Powers they used were almost identical.
 The new Great Dao Divine Spirits were all
 secretly shocked. They didn’t expect the Ultimate God of Punishment to be so
 powerful.
 In the past, they were only used to his status
 and did not know how strong he was.
 The Ultimate God of Punishment and the Primordial Ancestor God’s power was clearly higher than the power those at the Great Dao Supreme yielded. Be it the Primordial Chaos or the Chaos, they were both shocked.
 At the same time.
 Primordial Domain, beside the Primordial
 Pool.
 Han Huang and Goddess Ming Ji stood side by side looking down at the Primordial Despair.
 Goddess Ming Ji asked with lingering fear, “Husband, how long are you going to raise it? It’s already strong enough.”
 Primordial Despair was sleeping. Even so,
 aura emitted made her shiver.
 the
 She had never felt such a terrifying aura. She even felt that Primordial Despair had already reached her husband’s height.
 Han Huang said expressionlessly, “It can’t bring true despair to the Primordial Chaos
 yet. We still have to wait.”
 “Until when?”
 “When the Great Dao Divine Spirit dies.”
 “The Great Dao Divine Spirit will die?”
 Rules.
 Han Huang’s expression was illuminated by
 the purple light of the Primordial Pool as he said softly, “Of course. Many will die.” Goddess Ming Ji was puzzled, but she did not ask further. She chose to believe her husband.
 “Husband, how confident are you about this Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity?”
 “I only do what I want to do and do my best. I don’t consider success or failure because I will
 only win.”
 “Regardless of victory or defeat, I’m willing to follow you in life and death.”
 “You might die, and for the sake of my great
 cause, I won’t focus on you.”
 “Even if I die, I’m willing.” Goddess Ming Ji looked at Han Huang with a gentle expression. Her gaze could be said to be filled with love, causing Han Huang to
 frown.
 Han Jue opened his eyes.
 Ten million years had passed. He was getting closer and closer to the
 Creator Lord Realm. He could already sense the barrier.
 As long as he broke through that mysterious
 The Ultimate Origin World also expanded at an unprecedented speed in these ten million years, almost doubling in size.
 The Purity Great Dao World had already arrived beside the Ultimate Origin World and
 was devoured by it. The Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity silently endured it. After the Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity transformed into an Ultimate Origin Lifeform, the Purity Great Dao World transformed itself into the Ultimate Origin World. The Ultimate Origin Qi washed the internal environment of the Purity Great Dao World.
 Han Jue said, “Shan’e, go to the Nine Divine
 Stars’ Daoist temple.”
 While cursing, Shan’e opened his eyes and hurriedly stood up to leave.
 As for why he was chased away, he did not
 dare to ask.
 He walked very quickly, as if he was in a hurry to curse, afraid that it would delay him.
 Chaos was in the flames of war. The Primordial Chaos and the Chaos kept fighting, but in short, the Primordial Chaos was unstoppable and its domain was expanding.
 Han Huang had yet to appear, but he suppressed the Chaos with his subordinates and Hidden Sect’s fellow disciples. The Chaotic factions watching the battle couldn’t sit still anymore. They appeared one
 From the looks of it, if Han Huang did not make a move, Primordial Chaos would suffer
 its first defeat.
 However, Han Jue had already seen Han Huang’s methods. It was a product condensed through the Supreme Rules of the various
 Great Dao Worlds. There was indeed hope of overturning the Chaos and bringing despair to
 it.
 Han Jue was curious. What would the Ninth Chaos do?
 If he could see that thing, so could the Ninth
 Chaos. It would definitely prepare a backup plan. Once the Ninth Chaos participated, Han Jue would also make a move. Therefore, the Ninth Chaos had to prepare other methods to stop
 him.
 It was worth mentioning that Li Yao, Xuan Qingjun, and Dao Comprehension Sword had also entered the calamity and went to reinforce the Primordial Chaos. Among them, Li Yao was the most famous. Even Laozi
 couldn’t do anything to her.
 The current Li Yao was already at the top of
 the Chaos. In addition, Han Jue often preached the Dao to her. Her Mystical Power was unfathomable. Ordinary Great Dao Supremes could easily lose to her.
 However, a force caught Han Jue’s attention. Dao Heavenly Race!
 Pangu and the Dao Ancestor had joined forces to create a new race. This race was also participating in this battle, but they were not only dealing with the Primordial Chaos but also the Chaotic lifeforms.
 It seemed that they wanted to take advantage of the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity to push the Dao Heavenly Race to the peak.
 was, they had to have a powerful force to support their growth.
 It was impossible for the Ninth Chaos to let
 them replace the Chaos. Han Jue wouldn’t let
 his son die in the hands of the Dao Heavenly
 Race.


 In a mysterious domain.
 The Chaotic Consciousness, the Formless Transcendent Deity, and Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction Venerable gathered.
 The Chaotic Consciousness said, “The Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity seems to have submitted to the Divine Might. What should we do?”
 Although the battle between Han Jue and the Ninth Chaos didn’t begin, it had clearly begun.
 Han Jue’s son, Han Huang, wanted to destroy the Chaos. He also had the support of a large number of disciples. This was clearly going against the Ninth Chaos.
 Han Jue didn’t stop him, which meant that he acknowledged it.
 Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction Venerable sighed. “We probably have to make a choice. We can’t be alone.”
 The Formless Transcendent Deity sighed.
 The Chaotic Consciousness asked, “Are we going together or working separately?”
 The two Dao Creators were silent.
 The Chaotic Consciousness said, “Actually, we don’t have a choice.”
 That’s right.
 Their Great Dao World had already been fused by the Chaos. They were the Ninth Chaos’ slaves. Could they still resist?
 The Formless Transcendent Deity said, “This is our only chance. If we don’t struggle, I’m afraid in the future…”
 Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction
 Venerable sighed. “Even a loyal lackey like the Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity…”
 The Chaotic Consciousness’ eight eyes narrowed. “Support the Divine Might? If we fail and he surpasses the Dao Creator Realm, I’m afraid…”
 “What if Divine Might wins?”
 The Formless Transcendent Deity’s question made the Chaotic Consciousness silent again.
 Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction Venerable did not say anything and also
 weighed the pros and cons.
 After a long while…
 The Chaotic Consciousness asked,
 “Transcendent, have you made your choice? The Heavenly Court is your attitude, right?”
 The Heavenly Court had already rushed to the battlefield. To the Chaos’ surprise, the Heavenly Court actually wanted to help the Primordial Chaos, catching them off guard and even causing morale to fluctuate.
 A peerless expert appeared in the Heavenly Court and called himself the Ultimate Origin Fiendcelestial. He was very powerful and had once fought several Great Dao Supremes without losing.
 However, not long after the Ultimate Origin Fiendcelestial revealed its reputation, it was surrounded by nine mysterious existences and suppressed, disappearing without a trace.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor was furious and had no choice but to shift the Heavenly Court’s attention to finding the Ultimate Origin Fiendcelestial, and leave the
 battlefield.
 Although the Heavenly Court had only participated in the battle for a short time, in the eyes of the Chaotic Consciousness, this was the Formless Transcendent Deity’s
 attitude.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor had the closest relationship with Han Jue and the Formless Transcendent Deity. It could even be said he was the bridge between the two.
 With the Evil Heavenly Emperor around, the two of them had the possibility of forming an
 alliance.
 The Formless Transcendent Deity said, “I want to be a true Dao Creator.”
 “A true Dao Creator…”
 The Chaotic Consciousness was shocked by
 this sentence.
 Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction Venerable asked faintly, “But how can you be sure that the Divine Might will let you?” The Formless Transcendent Deity said, “Other than the enemy, you should understand his attitude towards his disciples and children.”
 Han Jue posed almost no restrictions on his children and disciples. Cultivating wholeheartedly was indeed rare.
 They had also observed the Ultimate Origin
 World. Han Jue also had a free attitude
 towards it.
 The more they thought about it, the more tempted they became.
 Thinking about it carefully, they had no
 grudge against Han Jue and he didn’t offend
 them.
 From the beginning to the end, they wanted to test Han Jue many times. The Formless Transcendent Deity said, “There’s no need to say too much. There’s no
 existence older than us in this world. Choose based on your own heart. Just don’t regret it.”
 With that, the Formless Transcendent Deity vanished.
 The Chaotic Consciousness looked at Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction Venerable and asked, “What about you?” Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction Venerable said, “Although I have a favorable
 impression of Divine Might, I still believe in the Chaos. Since ancient times, when has he ever lost? Furthermore, there’s the variable of the Dark Forbidden Lord.
 “Consciousnessless, perhaps we will be
 inferior to the Chaos, but how many mistakes have we made? The Chaos has already tolerated us. Are you really sure that our
 “The more depressed he is, the more I’m
 worried that he will change drastically.”
 The Chaotic Consciousness pondered.
 …
 Time passed quickly.
 The war in the Chaos progressed very quickly. As the battles continued everywhere, the flames of war spread to the various Great Dao
 World domains. Order collapsed and Yin and Yang changed sides.
 future came. Although it did not affect the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity, it also made all living beings despair.
 When would such a chaotic situation end?
 The Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity’s negative karma became stronger and stronger. Boundless resentment filled the
 void, also producing many unprecedented evil
 devils.
 From Great Dao Sages to mortals, they were all wrapped in the karma of the monstrous calamity and fought endlessly.
 The Primordial Chaos and the Chaos had wins
 and losses on different battlefields. Sages and Freedom Sages died one after another, but Great Dao Sages rarely died. As for the Great Dao Supremes, none of them died. This was something that all living beings
 below the Great Dao Sage Realm could not see. They only saw the Eternal mighty figures lead the charge. In addition to the blood feud, they naturally sacrificed their lives.
 Almost all the Hidden Sect disciples entered the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity, including the Han family descendants. Now,
 the hatred between the Primordial Chaos and
 the Chaos had already reached an irreconcilable level.
 Han Jue was still focused on cultivating.
 He was getting closer and closer to breaking through.
 million years old, opened his eyes and frowned.
 “Is this your choice? You have to pay the
 price,” Han Jue muttered to himself with a
 cold gaze.
 Two powerful Dao Creators descended into
 the Chaos. Although they were not using their
 full strength, it was enough to change the situation of the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity and make Han Huang personally take action.
 Chaotic Consciousness!
 Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction Venerable!
 They divided their strength among their subordinates and attacked the Primordial Chaos forcefully. They were invincible and unstoppable.
 Han Jue immediately sent a voice transmission to the Formless Transcendent
 Deity and the Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity.
 Two against two, very fair! The two Dao Creators immediately took action. In less than a day, they each created an expert that far exceeded the Great Dao Supreme Realm and rushed to the battlefield.
 The four mighty figures who had the power of a Dao Creator could make the entire Chaos
 Although they were strong, they were not true
 Dao Creators. Han Huang was stronger than them, so Han Jue wasn’t worried for now. “Our subordinates have already made a move. Next, let’s see who breaks through first,” Han Jue muttered to himself with an excited
 expression.
 Different levels fought different battles. Behind the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity stood Han Jue and the Ninth Chaos. Their
 battle had already changed the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity’s meaning.
 Then, Han Jue closed his eyes and continued
 cultivating.
 At this moment, a rainbow flew past the universe of stars.
 A figure stood in the rainbow light. It was the reincarnated Dao Ancestor, Hong Jun. Hong Jun looked down and did not see his master, Liu Bei. Not stopping, he continued to rush towards the Primordial Chaos.


 Purple Qi filled the Primordial Hall.
 Hong Jun looked at the majestic figure standing on the platform in front of him in a daze.
 “What do you want?” Han Huang asked with his back facing him. His tone was cold.
 Hong Jun’s seniority in this life was the same as Han Huang’s. Han Huang knew his master, Liu Bei, so they were also fellow disciples. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have personally met Hong Jun.
 Hong Jun faced him calmly. He wasn’t afraid or moved.
 Han Huang said, “The Primordial Chaos needs the Dao Heavenly Race’s sincerity. After destroying the Nine Extremes Orthodoxy, I agree to let the Dao Heavenly Race be the orthodox lineage of the Primordial Chaos and carry the first Heavenly Destiny.”
 Nine Extremes Orthodoxy…
 Hong Jun was moved. He had naturally heard of the Nine Extremes Orthodoxy. Its leader was even from the Heavenly Dao.
 Han Huang stared into Hong Jun’s eyes with extreme dignity. The pressure was heavy. An ordinary person would probably not be able to stand steadily.
 Even the reincarnated Dao Ancestor, Hong Jun, was shocked.
 How strong was this Primordial
 Fiendcelestial?
 Hong Jun felt the pressure, but he knew there was no room for negotiation.
 Han Huang didn’t trust him.
 He even felt a hint of killing intent in the hall.
 This killing intent was extremely terrifying,
 causing his soul to tremble.
 Clearly, Han Huang sensed his ambition.
 Hong Jun said, “Alright!”
 Han Huang smiled. “Very good. Then I’ll wait
 for the good news.’
 Hong Jun cupped his hands and bowed before
 leaving.
 Killing intent flashed across Han Huang’s
 eyes as looked at his departing figure. “Dao Heavenly Race? I want to see if you’re worthy!”
 He snorted in disdain.
 After so many years, the Dao Heavenly Race
 Anyone with discerning eyes could tell that
 they were ambitious.
 Han Huang looked into the depths of the
 chaos.
 The four extremely powerful auras made him
 uneasy.
 He had never seen them before. Why were there suddenly so many existences that could
 threaten him?
 He suddenly felt that he had yet to see the
 Chaos clearly.
 What kind of world was above the Chaos?
 What was his father’s vision?
 Was the mysterious existence who had
 created the Chaos still alive?
 Too many doubts filled Han Huang’s heart.
 “In the end, I’m still too weak. If I can
 surpass the Great Dao Supreme Realm and reach Father’s realm…”
 Han Huang’s eyes flickered. His ambitions burned in his eyes.
 Time passed.
 cultivation. He even forgot about the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity.
 A Dao Creator could create everything. It was
 already a supreme realm and the limit that living beings could think of. He was omniscient and undying. Space-time, karma, and providence were all in their eyes.
 The Creator Lord Realm was even stronger.
 Han Jue didn’t know how strong he was. This was a realm that no one had ever reached.
 Han Jue also obtained many insights when the Ultimate Origin World crazily devoured the blank domain and kept expanding. He saw
 many things that came from the blank domain.
 The blank domain looked blank, but it was
 actually abundant. It contained the basic elements of rules, creation, fate, and so on. It
 was as if controlling these profound substances that even the Dao Creator could not see could open up everything.
 His Ultimate Origin World could even replace
 the blank domain and reach an endless
 number.
 What was endless? Even a Dao Creator could
 never reach the end.
 This was a journey that intoxicated Han Jue.
 He couldn’t help but wonder if there was an end to the blank domain.
 How was the blank domain born?
 Han Jue’s will swam wantonly in the blank
 domain. In a daze, the Chaos swept past him. However, in this instant, everything that had happened since ancient times and the future
 development of the Chaos were in his eyes. The future was uncontrollable. No matter how powerful his cultivation was, he could only
 control the future that was weaker than him.
 However, the future of any existence could be controlled by Han Jue if he reached the Creator Lord Realm.
 Although he had yet to master this power, just
 the thought was enough to make him intoxicated.
 Apart from those basic elements, there were
 indeed no other worlds and races hidden in
 the blank domain. Han Jue saw the Ancient Primordial World and Huang Zuntian. Other than them, there were no living beings in the
 At the same time, in the Ancient Primordial
 World. Primordial Origin opened his eyes and frowned.
 “Was that an illusion?”
 He pinched his fingers to deduce but could not deduce anything. Logically speaking, it was impossible for him
 to be mistaken with his cultivation level. However, he had absorbed too much Primordial negative karma and had indeed hallucinated.
 Han Jue’s consciousness wandered in the blank domain for an unknown length of time. He felt that it was extremely long. He had seen too many scenes. It was enough to be a
 hundred times, a thousand times, or even more than the experiences of all the living beings in the entire Chaos since ancient
 times.
 A Great Dao Sage would probably not be able
 to withstand such a memory impact.
 Han Jue suddenly opened his eyes. He discovered that he had appeared in a blank
 domain.
 There was nothing in all directions. No Great Dao Worlds could be seen.
 Han Jue looked down at his hands. His control
 over his body was still there.
 However, he couldn’t sense the Ultimate Origin World or the Chaos. This state was extremely strange.
 It was as if he was the only one in the blank
 domain.
 Han Jue’s eyes narrowed. The blank domain suddenly changed. All sorts of colors appeared in the space and all sorts of distorted forms
 appeared, like the condensed form of the three thousand Great Dao. These gas-shaped substances moved quickly, making the entire blank domain dazzling and illusory. Even Han Jue felt dizzy.
 He was not dizzy from vision, but a power. The basic rules of the blank domain! The so-called basic rules were Han Jue’s description of the core operating power of the blank domain. He didn’t know what it was,
 but this power was very strange, enough to make a Dao Creator dizzy. At this moment…
 A figure appeared in front of Han Jue. It was
 Creator Lord?” Another Han Jue stared into his eyes and asked.
 unprecedented door!
 Before that, he needed to purify his Dao heart
 and surpass all living beings.
