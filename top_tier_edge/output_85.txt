“Where is the Primordial Fiendcelestial?” Han Jue asked calmly. He began to ponder about the Nine-Headed Divine Spirit’s intentions.
The Nine-Headed Divine Spirit replied, “I don’t know either, but you can create one and advance the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity, allowing the Endless Era to arrive as soon as possible.”
Han Jue frowned and asked, “What is the Endless Era?”
“Our past can be written off. I only hope that the Endless Era will arrive as soon as possible so that I can leave the mortal world.”
Han Jue narrowed his eyes. “Why are you in such a hurry? You shouldn’t be like this with the time you’ve existed, right?”
The Nine-Headed Divine Spirit said, “I won’t hide it. Although Father suppressed two transcendent existences, there are two others. One of them is bloodthirsty and is about to awaken. Once he awakens, he will clean up the living beings of the Chaos and help Father restrain the development of the living beings.
Han Jue asked in surprise, “Why?”
The Nine-Headed Divine Spirit smiled. “The Great Dao World will be freed when the Endless Era arrives. He’ll be busy developing his Great Dao World. How can he have the time to care about the Chaos?”
“Then why didn’t your Father directly stop him from slaughtering all the living beings in the Chaos?”
“Because he knows his limits and only kills existences above the Sage Realm. Father might care about his reputation, that’s why he doesn’t suppress the Chaotic mighty figures. He can make use of this.”
The Nine-Headed Divine Spirit’s tone contained a hint of anger.
Han Jue frowned again.
He thought that he could wait for the Great Dao Calamity and the Endless Era after talking to the Ninth Chaos. He didn’t expect another Dao Creator to appear.
The Nine-Headed Divine Spirit continued, “I can’t say much regarding that existence. Otherwise, I’ll be discovered. You can try your best to choose a Primordial Fiendcelestial candidate as soon as possible. It doesn’t have to be the true Primordial Fiendcelestial. After all, the Primordial Fiendcelestial is a legend. You only need to give him the name of the Primordial Fiendcelestial. In addition, this child has to have powerful potential to withstand the providence of the Great Dao Calamity.
“The Primordial Fiendcelestial needs to inherit the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity and shatter the blank domain in the Endless Era. The blank domain is actually the Primordial Rule that binds the Chaos.”
With that, the Nine-Headed Divine Spirit hurriedly ended the dream.
Han Jue opened his eyes and asked in his mind, “Is what the Nine-Headed Divine Spirit said true?”
(50 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
Continue!
[It’s true.]
“Who is the Dao Creator that the Nine-Headed Divine Spirit mentioned?”
(There is no such karma. It cannot be deduced.)
“Which Dao Creator is bloodthirsty and will slaughter existences above the Chaos Sage Realm?”
[2 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?)
Tsk tsk!
It was stronger than the Formless Transcendent Deity and the Chaotic Consciousness!
Han Jue secretly chose to continue.
A message appeared in front of him.
[Immeasurable Destruction Venerable Shi Tian: Early-stage Dao Creator, Chaotic Deity, First Chaos’ Inheritor, Ninth Chaos’ Personal Disciple]
It was still the early-stage Dao Creator. It seemed that the suppression of the Ninth Chaos was very strong, preventing the three Dao Creators from breaking through.
Han Jue focused on the Primordial Fiendcelestial.
Han Huang was a Primordial Fiendcelestial, but too many monstrous figures had appeared in the same era. For example, Dao Sovereign and Jiang Jueshi. They would both be Dao Creators in the future. One had to know that the former Primordial Fiendcelestial had not reached the Dao Creator Realm. Therefore, it was not impossible for the young Primordial Fiendcelestial to be chased by such a prodigy.
In fact, in terms of potential, Han Huang was definitely a unique existence, but the other top ten geniuses all had great providence.
Han Jue thought of Dao Sovereign. The future Great Dao Sovereign had contributed to creating the Endless Era and was conferred the title of Great Dao Sovereign.
Should he make Dao Sovereign the Primordial Fiendcelestial?
Han Jue felt that it was feasible. This way Han Huang would also be protected.
Han Huang was too straightforward. He didn’t have as much experience as Dao Sovereign. He would probably be used by others if he stirred up the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity.
Forget it, there was no hurry.
“I want to know how long until Immeasurable Destruction Venerable Shi Tian descends into the Chaos?” [2 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
Continue!
[About 1.9 billion years.]
What was the hurry!
Han Jue rolled his eyes and threw this matter to the back of his mind.
Soon, he entered cultivation again.
In the crimson sky, the endless sea surged. All sorts of huge bones undulated on the sea.
An ancient pagoda suddenly descended. Dao Sovereign, Zhao Xuanyuan, Jiang Yi, Lao Dan, and Han Ye stood on it.
Han Ye carried the World Piercing Divine Origin Bow on his back as he scanned the surroundings.
He asked curiously, “What is this place?”
Zhao Xuanyuan smiled. “This is the recently famous Transcendent Great Dao World of the Chaos. It’s as endless as the Chaos, but it’s suppressed by the Chaos, causing this place to be desolate.”
Han Ye frowned. “Since it’s desolate, why are we here?”
Lao Dan stroked his beard. “That’s right. In the past, there were only three thousand Great Dao and Seven Supreme Rules. There were only a little more than a hundred Great Dao Sages before the Divine Might Heavenly Sage’s rise. It was enough. However, more and more Great Dao Sages appeared after several eras of geniuses. The Great Dao of the Chaos became insufficient. The Ultimate God of Punishment did not allow all the Great Dao to be privately occupied. Therefore, the mighty figures targeted the other two Great Dao Worlds.”
Han Ye snorted. “Your own power is the real thing. You can easily lose yourself by using the power of the Great Dao.”
Lao Dan looked at him and smiled. “You’re really far-sighted. In the past, Life Lord Huang Zuntian suffered this loss and lost his position as the Eternal Peak.”
Dao Sovereign’s expression turned ugly.
Zhao Xuanyuan saw through his thoughts and changed the topic. “Hurry up and take action. I heard that the Northern Chaos Holy Lord has descended in advance and repelled many mighty figures. This fellow is probably not greedy for the Great Dao, but the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority!”
Jiang Yi nodded and controlled the ancient pagoda to advance.
The World Piercing Divine Origin Bow on Han Ye’s back suddenly vibrated, causing him to frown.
Lao Dan looked at the divine bow and smiled. “Looks like this treasure also reacted. There will be a huge battle next.”
Dao Sovereign stood up, his robes fluttering. He said proudly, “It’s been a long time since I’ve encountered a match.”


 Time passed.
 More than two million years passed.
 [Detected that you are 40 million years old and your life has taken another step forward. You have the following choices:]
 (1: Exit seclusion immediately and open the Ultimate Origin World in the Chaos. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment, a Primordial Fragment, and a Creation Spirit Stone.)
 [2: Cultivate in a low-profile manner and stay away from trouble. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment, a Primordial Fragment, and a Creation Spirit Stone.]
 (You have obtained a Creation Heaven’s Chosen attempt.]
 Han Jue silently chose the second option.
 This time, the system was very reliable. The rewards for both options were the same.
 Currently, he had already accumulated eight Great Dao Fragments, six Primordial Fragments, and five Creation Spirit Stones.
 The previous Creation Spirit Stones were used to give birth to Chaotic Fiendcelestials. He kept this item now that all the Chaotic Fiendcelestials had been born on their own.
 The Creation Spirit Stone could turn anything into a living being. Han Jue felt that it could be useful in the future.
 As for the Creation Heaven’s Chosen, he did not use it immediately.
 There was no hurry.
 N
 Han Jue was very satisfied with Han Yao’s performance. This kid was worthy of his ten thousand years of teaching. He vividly displayed the characteristics of the Conquest Heavenly Star.
 Han Jue looked at Han Ling beside him. Her cultivation level had been increasing. He suddenly looked forward to her entering the fray.
 However, he didn’t know if he had to rely on the Ninth Chaos to attain the Creator Lord Realm or the Primordial Fiendcelestial to break through the blank domain during the Endless Era for the time being.
 Han Ling felt his gaze and opened her eyes. She asked, “Father, what’s wrong?”
 Han Jue didn’t expose her.
 The father and daughter chatted for a while before continuing to cultivate.
 Han Jue had a sudden thought and asked in his mind, “I want to know what my daughter Han Ling will be like at her peak?”
 (100 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Gasp!
 So impressive!
 Continue, continue!
 Han Jue suppressed his excitement, and his consciousness entered the illusion.
 He was in the blank domain when he opened his eyes again. Unlike reality, countless universes were floating in the future. Every black void was dotted with countless stars or the vast Great Dao Worlds.
 Han Jue looked up and his mood subconsciously brightened.
 Endless Era!
 It was more imposing and vast than the Chaos!
 The Chaos was like a cage in Han Jue’s eyes after attaining the Great Dao Supreme Realm.
 Soon, a mighty figure descended. Her body shone with a strong light. Seven Great Dao Worlds stood under her feet, beside her, and above her head. Even Han Jue had to look up to her.
 Han Ling?
 Han Ling seemed to be floating in the void. She had her hands on her back and was wearing silver divine armor. Her lotus dress fluttered like divine colors. Her long hair scattered under her crown like a waterfall. The surrounding Seven Great Dao Worlds showed that she was supreme and unparalleled.
 How holy and domineering!
 Han Jue finally saw the glory of the Primordial Emperor Star.
 He suddenly saw two figures in front of Han Ling. They were billions of feet tall and were also domineering. However, they were like stones at the foot of a mountain in front of Han Ling, extremely tiny.
 Han Ye, Han Yao!
 The former wore black armor, while the latter wore silver armor. One was black and the other was white, like two sides of Yin and
 Yang.
 “Tsk tsk, this girl still listened to me. She really took in these two brats.”
 Han Jue laughed in his heart. He was very satisfied with Han Ling’s attitude. At least, this girl was obedient.
 He was really worried that Han Ling would be jealous of the two of them and not tolerate them.
 The more Han Jue looked at the three of them, the more he liked them.
 Emperor Star, Killing Star, Conquest Star!
 It was a match made in heaven!
 He wondered where the three of them were going Han Ling suddenly stopped and raised her right hand, then slowly clenched it. In an instant, the blank void above Han Jue’s head tore open.
 Han Jue looked up. In the spatial crack was the image of a Great Dao World. There were countless living beings guarding the edge of the crack, ready to attack at any time.
 Han Ling’s voice was indifferent and dignified.
 “Here!” “Here!”
 Han Ye and Han Yao shouted at the same time, causing the spatial crack above Han Jue’s head to fluctuate violently and tear wider.
 The illusion shattered.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and didn’t know what to say.
 He had spent 100 quadrillion years of his lifespan.
 He still wanted to see what would happen
 next.
 However, although this illusion was short, it revealed a lot of information.
 Han Ling seemed to control great authority in the Endless Era. She could slaughter a Great Dao World just because she wanted to?
 Tsk tsk, it was unknown how long it was in the future, but there were actually so many Great Dao Worlds.
 Han Jue felt a sense of urgency.
 There were only five Dao Creators now, but the future was uncertain.
 Han Jue’s heart skipped a beat.
 No!
 He had to hurry up and cultivate. It would take him a long time to catch up to the Ninth Chaos in terms of cultivation.
 Han Jue closed his eyes and started cultivating
 Heavenly Dao, outside the 33rd Heaven, Han Sacred Palace.
 Han Qing’er smiled and said, “Fifth Brother, you still haven’t attained the Great Dao after so many years. You’re a little embarrassing to our Han family.”
 The middle-aged man sitting at the head of the table was Li Yao’s son, Han Yunjin.
 Facing his sister’s teasing, Han Yunjin said helplessly, “I don’t have the talent of my brothers and sisters, so I naturally can’t attain the Great Dao. However, my descendant, Han Yao, didn’t embarrass the Han family.”
 Jiang Jueshi, who was sitting opposite Han Qing’er, smiled and said, “Han Yao is indeed powerful. He has Junior Huang’s potential. His Majesty, the Heavenly Emperor, likes him very much.”
 Han Qing’er glared at him, causing him to laugh helplessly and not say anything else.
 Han Yunjin asked curiously, “Why are Third Sister and Senior Jiang here?”


 It had been a long time, but Han Yunjin and Han Qing’er were still quite distant. Although Han Qing’er acted like they were close, Han Yunjin couldn’t help but wonder what it was.
 The difference in cultivation between the siblings was great, so they rarely walked around.
 Han Qing’er smiled and said, “I want to ask if there are any prodigies like Han Yao in the Han family. Your second brother wants to take in a disciple. He doesn’t have any children, so he can only find one from your knees.”
 Han Yunjin was moved and looked happy.
 He was a Heavenly Dao Sage, after all. He had traveled the Chaos and naturally knew Han Huang’s prestige. The current Han Huang could be considered a top mighty figure in the Chaos. He could cover the ages with one hand. His Mystical Power was unimaginable.
 Han Yunjin said, “My Han family has many geniuses. Each generation is stronger than the last. Since Second Brother wants a disciple, I naturally have to choose the strongest one.”
 Han Qing’er immediately beamed and covered her mouth. “Fifth Brother, don’t disappoint Third Sister. I promised Second Brother.”
 Han Yunjin smiled and nodded. He immediately sent a voice transmission.
 After making arrangements, Han Yunjin asked curiously, “Why does Second Brother suddenly want to take in a disciple?”
 Han Qing’er spread her hands, indicating that she didn’t know.
 Han Yunjin was deep in thought. He had also heard of the Great Dao World, but in his opinion, it was only the largest world. He could also create a world, but it did not affect his cultivation level much. It was already tiring enough to manage the Han family, so he naturally couldn’t be bothered to create a world.
 Han Qing’er snorted. “Second Brother is simply crazy. He has already reached the peak of history and is even a Divine Punisher. He dominates a Chaotic Domain. Fewer than five existences can match him in the Chaos. He’s actually still busy cultivating in seclusion. In another ten million years, perhaps the juniors will no longer remember him, just like Father. In this current world, how many living beings still remember the Divine Might Heavenly Sage?”
 Jiang Jueshi smiled and did not refute or agree. The higher he stood, the more he knew about the depths of the Chaos.
 Han Yunjin asked, “How is Father?”
 “How would I know? He’s always in seclusion. Only Sister Ling’er can always be by his side,” Han Qing’er replied.
 Han Yunjin fell into deep thought at the mention of Han Ling.
 Not long after, a Sage of the Han family brought a handsome prodigy over.
 Jiang Jueshi sized him up with a hint of disappointment in his eyes.
 He also wanted to choose a prodigy to enter his world!
 After five million years, the races in the mortal world changed. The Heavenly Dao and the sun and moon spun. The eras changed and the Chaos also changed day by day.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and felt his Dharmic powers.
 The Ultimate Origin World developed steadily. There was already a vast world. The Ultimate Origin Qi was endless and filled the world. The Spirit Qi was already far superior to the Chaos in terms of cultivation.
 Han Jue first entered the simulation trial and challenged a hundred Formless Transcendent Deities.
 He won easily!
 Two hundred Formless Transcendent Deities!
 An hour later, Han Jue had the upper hand.
 He was satisfied. After all, they were Dao Creators. Every additional one was not simple.
 In any case, he was not afraid of anyone other than the Ninth Chaos.
 Han Jue recalled that the Ultimate God of Punishment had sent him a dream request tens of thousands of years ago, but he was busy in seclusion and ignored it.
 He sent a dream to the Ultimate God of Punishment now.
 The dream was the Chaotic Void.
 The Ultimate God of Punishment immediately bowed when he saw him.
 Han Jue smiled and asked, “The Chaos has been stable recently. The number of Great Dao Divine Spirits has increased greatly. The overlords and ancient giants all listen to you. Why are you visiting me in my dreams?”
 Han Jue said, “Why don’t you eliminate them since you’re worried?”
 The Ultimate God of Punishment said, “I indeed wanted to do that, but I was stopped by a mysterious force and had no choice but to stop. I suspect that I was stopped by the Lord of Chaos. However, the Lord of Chaos clearly conferred me the title of leader of the Divine Spirits after the Chaotic Assembly ended. Why didn’t he tell me bluntly if he wanted to protect those races?”
 He hesitated but didn’t continue. Instead, he stared at him.
 Han Jue said, “You’re right. Perhaps it’s not the Lord of Chaos.”
 The Ultimate God of Punishment was moved.
 Han Jue continued, “The next trend in the Chaos is the Primordial Fiendcelestial. He will stir up the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity. Transcendent existences are all waiting for the Primordial Fiendcelestial to appear. What you have to do is find it and help it grow. You have to wait for the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity to arrive.”
 The Ultimate God of Punishment asked in surprise, “Primordial Fiendcelestial? Isn’t that a legend? Besides, why will the Primordial Fiendcelestial harm the Chaos?”
 “Creation after destruction. You just need to find it and let it develop.” Han Jue shook his head.
 The Ultimate God of Punishment pondered in silence.
 Han Jue didn’t point out that Han Huang was the Primordial Fiendcelestial. He wanted Han Huang to prove himself.
 “I understand. Thank you for your guidance, Master!”
 The Ultimate God of Punishment bowed respectfully.
 The dream ended.
 Not bad.
 Han Jue enjoyed his current life very much. He didn’t have to worry about the future.
 He paid attention to the races that the Ultimate God of Punishment had mentioned. There were already dozens of them, all scattered at the edges of the Chaos. At first glance, they seemed to be developing from the edges inside.
 These races were rather strange. They didn’t have bodies and their souls were shaped. They almost didn’t have the appearance of humans.
 One had to know that the Human Race had the Connate Dao Body. It was a body that the Dao Ancestor studied Dao techniques and was the most suitable for cultivation and transformation. That was why Nüwa used it to create humans and why they were conferred the title of the protagonists of the Heavenly Dao.
 Han Jue couldn’t be bothered to calculate these races. He couldn’t directly interfere even if it was a Dao Creator’s plot. Currently, everyone was minding their own business and was doing well. Wasn’t that what he wanted?
 No one could cultivate faster than Han Jue as long as he was given time.
 His gaze landed on the five, including Dao Sovereign. They were still in the Transcendent Great Dao World.
 It was not only the Transcendent Great Dao World. The Consciousnessless Great Dao World was also fusing with the Chaos.


 Humans loved to rear living beings of other races. They were used as labor or food sources. It was no different from Han Ye’s actions.
 Han Jue wouldn’t interfere as long as he didn’t kill him.
 !!
 Han Jue was very satisfied with Dao Sovereign and the other three. They had good judgment. After tens of millions of years, Dao Sovereign and the other two didn’t forget their roots. Lao Dan didn’t scheme, either. The clone and the main body seemed to be independent.
 Han Jue looked at the other disciples. Zhou Fan, Jiang Jueshi, Long Hao, Fang Liang, and the others were also doing well.
 The personal disciples of the Heavenly Dao were also extremely powerful and insufferably arrogant.
 As for Han Tuo, Han Huang, and Han Qing’er, the first two were busy in seclusion. Han Qing’er traveled around with Jiang Jueshi.
 Han Jue teleported to the main Dao Field and called Han You over.
 Han You was the leader of the ten thousand members of the Nether Race. Back then, the Magus Race was expelled by the Heavenly Dao. In order to cover her loss of the Magus Race, Empress Houtu established the Nether Race and gave them extremely strong talent, depriving them of their ability to reproduce. Until now, there were still only ten thousand Nether Race members. However, they suffered no casualties because they stayed in the Hundred Peak Immortal River all year round.
 Han You was very excited to see Han Jue again.
 He had almost forgotten his appearance after tens of millions of years. He didn’t expect Han Jue to still remember him.
 Han Jue first asked about his well-being, making Han You grateful.
 Han You immediately said, “Sect Master, the Nether Race will follow you forever.”
 To them, Han Jue was not only the Sect Master but also their father. However, the Hidden Sect was powerful now, so they couldn’t get close to him.
 Han Jue immediately asked Han You to gather the Nether Race.
 Half a day later, Han Jue took the ten thousand Nether Race members into the Ultimate Origin World and sent them near the Life Fiendcelestial. He asked them to get along well and govern the Ultimate Origin World together in the future.
 The Life Fiendcelestial was currently the strongest Fiendcelestial in the Ultimate Origin World. It already had a Great Dao cultivation. Most of the Nether Race members were at the Freedom Realm and could assist the Life Fiendcelestial.
 The Life Fiendcelestial didn’t dare to bully the Nether Race with Han Jue watching. Furthermore, he had observed for a long time. The Life Fiendcelestial was gentle and not as ferocious as it looked.
 Han Jue returned to the third Dao Field after instructing him.
 He returned to the Daoist temple after interacting with his Dao Companions for hundreds of years.
 He looked at the universe of stars. The current universe of stars was filled with races and was extremely prosperous. Liu Bei had already nurtured a batch of disciples to govern this universe. Then, he returned to the third Dao Field and cultivated in peace.
 After so many years, Liu Bei’s desire for power had already calmed. He finally understood Han Jue’s efforts. Only cultivation was eternal. Power could only bring short-term joy. Of course, the short-term here could cover the lives of mortals.
 Han Jue watched for a while and lost interest.
 Although this universe of stars was created by him, it had already been devoured and fused by the Chaos. The providence was connected and no longer belonged to him.
 He should pay attention to the Ultimate Origin World in the future.
 Han Jue thought silently and closed his eyes to cultivate.
 In the blank domain.
 Han Huang meditated quietly. There was nothing in all directions, not even Spirit Qi.
 The Ultimate God of Punishment suddenly appeared and sized him up.
 He did not disturb him. Han Huang sensed his aura but did not open his eyes. He continued cultivating
 “Primordial Fiendcelestial… Where should I find it?”
 The Ultimate God of Punishment thought silently. His eyes suddenly lit up.
 Wasn’t Han Huang the most suitable person?
 Because Han Jue was a Chaotic Fiendcelestial, no living being would think that Han Huang was a Primordial Fiendcelestial. How could a Primordial Fiendcelestial be born from a Chaotic Fiendcelestial?
 However, the Primordial Fiendcelestial did not exist. According to Master, he could choose one.
 Should he let Han Huang take over?
 No!
 The Ultimate God of Punishment said, “Han Huang, I’m looking for you this time about the Great Dao Calamity.”
 Han Huang opened his eyes and asked, “Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity? Please speak.” “The Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity is already brewing. It might take ten million years or hundreds of millions of years. We have to find the Primordial Fiendcelestial before it arrives,” the Ultimate God of Punishment said slowly.
 He had naturally figured out his bloodline with his current cultivation. He was the Primordial Fiendcelestial!
 It was precisely because he knew that he was higher than the Chaotic Fiendcelestial that Han Huang wanted to cultivate diligently. Although he had obtained the Eternal Peak in the Chaotic Assembly, he had not left the Ten Absolutes behind. He was still considered a prodigy of the same level by the various factions. How could he tolerate this?
 Han Huang was naturally arrogant as a Primordial Fiendcelestial with greater talent than the Chaotic Fiendcelestial.
 Han Huang said, “Stop looking. I’m the Primordial Fiendcelestial.”
 The Ultimate God of Punishment was moved. “The Primordial Fiendcelestial is the key to the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity. You can’t pretend. I’m looking for you because I hope that you can help me find it.”
 Han Huang stood up and stared at him. “I am the Primordial Fiendcelestial! I know the danger you’re talking about, but I am. Stop looking!”
 The Ultimate God of Punishment was silent.
 Han Huang was even more furious upon seeing his attitude. “Could it be that you don’t believe me?”
 The Ultimate God of Punishment smiled bitterly. “I believe you. That’s all for now. Cultivate well. As for the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity, there are no signs
 yet.”
 With that, he vanished.
 Han Huang meditated as his eyes emitted a purple light. “Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity… Perhaps this is the opportunity for me to break through to a higher realm!”
 Han Huang thought silently and clenched his fists. He actually began to look forward to the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity.
 A world had already been established in the depths of his soul. There was still a long time before it turned into the Primordial Chaos. He was vexed by this. Now, the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity had given him a trace of hope. Han Huang did not notice that wisps of yellow Qi appeared behind him. They were surging and condensing into a human form.
 He suddenly turned around when he realized that something was wrong. A head surrounded by yellow Qi appeared in front of him. The two were less than half a meter apart.
 This head had disheveled hair and a face like a crimson ghost. Its eyes were sunken and had no whites. Its pupils were like snakes and scorpions as it stared at him.
 Han Huang did not panic and asked calmly, “Who are you?”
 The yellow head smiled sinisterly. “Primordial Fiendcelestial, are you willing to stay in the Chaos?”.
 Han Huang narrowed his eyes. “You should have been spying on me in the past million years, right?”
 “That’s right. I can help you if you want to create the Primordial Chaos!”
 “Oh? Then what do you want?”
 “Like you, I also have a world that needs to be created, but I’m suppressed by the Chaos and can’t do anything.”


 Han Huang asked upon hearing the yellow head’s words, “What can you do?”
 Han Huang smiled, “You have to prove your strength first if you want to cooperate with
 me!”
 !!
 Boom
 A terrifying aura erupted from Han Huang’s body. His robes fluttered violently as nebulous Primordial Qi coiled around his body like a hurricane. He was insufferably arrogant.
 The yellow head slowly retreated and smiled. “As expected of the Primordial Fiendcelestial. Such an aura is considered invincible among the Great Dao Supremes.”
 Han Huang snorted. The yellow head began to condense yellow Qi. Flesh and blood stretched out from under the head, producing a body at an extremely fast speed.
 Han Huang waited patiently, also wanting to see the other party’s strength.
 He had not fought to his heart’s content ever since the Chaotic Assembly ended.
 “Primordial Fiendcelestial, your potential is impressive, but how many geniuses have there been since ancient times? You’ve only cultivated for tens of millions of years. To me, your life is like a breath of time for mortals,” the yellow head said meaningfully.
 Han Huang frowned.
 “Let’s fight first!”
 Millions of years passed.
 (Detected that you are 50 million years old and your life has taken another step forward. You have the following choices:)
 (1: Exit seclusion immediately and open the Primordial Chaos in the Chaos. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment, a Primordial Fragment, a Creation Spirit Stone, and a Supreme Treasure.]
 [2: Cultivate in a low-profile manner and maintain your original intention. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment, a Primordial Fragment, a Creation Spirit Stone, and a chance to upgrade the system function.]
 (You have obtained a Creation Heaven’s Chosen attempt.)
 Eh?
 A chance to upgrade the system function!
 This was new!
 It appeared in the second option. Han Jue looked satisfied.
 The system was sensible now.
 He directly chose the second option.
 (You chose to cultivate in a low-profile manner and obtained a Great Dao Fragment, a Primordial Fragment, a Creation Spirit Stone, and a chance to upgrade the system function.]
 (Please choose a system function to upgrade.]
 Han Jue thought for a moment and chose the Creation Heaven’s Chosen.
 (The Creation Heaven’s Chosen is already top-notch and cannot be upgraded unless you surpass the Ultimate Origin Fiendcelestial.]
 Indeed, the Creation Heaven’s Chosen was related to the Ultimate Origin World, so the Ultimate Origin World’s Great Creation was higher than Jiang Jueshi’s Great Creation of the Chaos.
 Han Jue thought for a moment and chose the simulation trial.
 The simulation trial was extremely useful as it allowed Han Jue to judge the strength of his enemies.
 [Do you choose to upgrade the simulation trial?]
 “Yes!”
 (Simulation trial has begun to upgrade.)
 He actually needed to wait.
 Han Jue focused on the Great Dao Fragment. Nine Great Dao Fragments had been gathered, but he didn’t need a Great Dao Mystical Power.
 It was better to keep them in case they were useful in the future.
 Nine Great Dao Fragments could form a Great Dao Mystical Power. What about 99?
 Han Jue was looking forward to it!
 Since he had nothing to do, Han Jue decided to rest. He looked at Han Ling.
 Han Ling opened her eyes and waited for Han Jue’s instructions upon sensing his gaze.
 This girl’s cultivation had already reached the perfected Great Dao Supreme Realm. How
 “Have you been troubled by cultivation recently?” Han Jue asked.
 Han Jue smiled. “The Great Dao of Extreme Origin I taught you contains the truths of the three thousand Great Dao. You can absorb the rules of the three thousand Great Dao of the Chaos and derive them yourself.”
 Han Ling was enlightened and immediately stood up. “Father, I want to go out!”
 Han Jue smiled and nodded, sending her out of the third Dao Field.
 Han Ling immediately jumped out of the Chaos and arrived under the three thousand Great Dao.
 Speaking of which, this was the first time this girl went out alone. Han Jue was a little worried and stared at her.
 She had few opponents in the Chaos with her cultivation level, but Han Jue was afraid that she would be deceived.
 This was Han Jue’s most precious child. How could she be seduced by a thief?
 Han Jue paid attention silently.
 Han Ling absorbed the power of the three thousand Great Dao and quickly attracted a mighty figure’s attention. However, that mighty figure quickly retreated before he could say anything when he saw Han Ling. It turned out that his elder had once gone to the Chaotic Assembly. He remembered Han Ling’s appearance and immediately sent a voice transmission telling him to scram. He couldn’t provoke the Heavenly Sage’s daughter.
 Not long after, the Ultimate God of Punishment came and talked to Han Ling. The mighty figures and giants did not dare to disturb him.
 Han Ling chatted with the Ultimate God of Punishment as she absorbed the power of rules.
 She displayed the attitude of a junior facing the Ultimate God of Punishment, making him very satisfied as he praised her.
 A hundred years later, Han Huang and Han Tuo also came to see Han Ling. It was naturally lively when the siblings gathered.
 At the same time.
 Words appeared in front of Han Jue.
 (Simulation trial successfully upgraded.]
 It could derive the enemy’s future cultivation limit!
 The detection range covered a Great Dao World!
 Han Jue’s eyes lit up in surprise.
 In other words, he could copy the cultivation levels of everyone in the Chaos and fight wantonly. He could also fight with their future selves!
 Han Jue was in a good mood. He immediately copied the entire Chaos and started the simulation trial.
 He directly challenged all living beings and asked the system to set the future limit of their cultivation.
 Wow!
 It would have been fine if it was not set up, but more than twenty Dao Creators and more than a hundred thousand Great Dao Sages appeared!
 The Chaos was still impressive and contained many impressive geniuses.
 Most of these Dao Creators were familiar to Han Jue, but some he had never heard of.
 He had really misjudged them.
 Han Jue began to focus on the battle.
 Five minutes later, he destroyed all living beings in the Chaos!
 No pressure at all!
 Han Jue began to fight the Formless Transcendent Deity alone. He discovered that the Formless Transcendent Deity’s limit was not much stronger than now.
 Just like that, Han Jue was immersed in the simulation trial.
 Tens of thousands of years later.
 Han Ling ended the absorption of the power of rules and prepared to leave. She suddenly saw a figure in the distance absorbing the power of the Great Dao.
 She took a closer look and saw that it was Laozi.
 Han Ling had learned about Laozi from her father and knew his true appearance. He was a top mighty figure of the Chaos.
 Laozi felt her gaze and nodded slightly as a greeting. Han Ling bowed and prepared to leave.
 “Young friend Han Ling, there’s something I want to say, but do you think I should say it?”.
 Laozi’s voice suddenly floated into her ears.
