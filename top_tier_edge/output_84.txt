 Conquest Heavenly Star!
 It looked so impressive!
 Han Jue discovered that the three Heaven’s Chosen Great Creations all ended with “Star”. Could it be related to his Stellar Primordial Body? Were these creations derived from the stars of the Ultimate Origin World?
 Han Jue began to deduce Han Yao.
 !!
 Han Yao was a descendant of Li Yao’s son, Han Yunjin. He was born in the main Han family in the Immortal World. His starting point was much higher than Han Ye’s.
 He didn’t have to treat Han Yao like how he treated Han Ye. Han Ye started from nothing and needed someone to lead him to cultivate. However, Han Yao was different. He was born rich and it was not difficult for him to embark on the path of cultivation. Han Jue only needed to recruit him to cultivate beside him when he grew up and nurture him openly.
 Han Ye, Han Yao…
 Han Jue thought of something and couldn’t help but smile.
 Han Ling asked, “Father, what are you thinking?”
 Han Jue smiled and said, “The Han family has another good seedling.”
 Han Ling’s face darkened.
 Han Jue laughed and continued to travel the world with her.
 Immortal World, Buzhou Mountain.
 All the forces gathered here. The entire mountain was filled with cultivators of various races. There were countless of them.
 Two figures faced each other on the peak of the mountain. One was the Sect Master of the Flying Heaven Sect, and the other was the master of the Han family. In the distance, Han Yu sat under an old tree and watched quietly.
 The Han family and the Flying Heaven Sect disciples watched from the sky outside the mountain peak. Both sides were on high alert and extremely nervous.
 The Flying Heaven Sect Master was the first to speak. “Fellow Daoist Han, the beginning of this karma lies with your Han family disciples. Could it be that you want the disciples of the Heavenly Sect to swallow their anger?”
 The Han family’s master snorted. “It’s indeed because of my Han family’s disciples, but your disciples can just teach them a lesson. Why do you have to be so ruthless?”
 on.
 The Sect Master of the Flying Heaven Sect said, “How can I teach you a lesson? You destroyed my disciple’s opportunity. Such a situation is irreconcilable in the cultivation world. Why is your Han family so powerful?”
 “Then in the cultivation world, there’s still a need to seek revenge. If you fight the young, the old will attack. Why should your Flying Heaven Sect ask the Sages for help? Besides, that opportunity didn’t belong to your disciple in the first place. At that time, no one knew the exact situation. A group of juniors fought for the opportunity. Your disciple lost the opportunity, so you blame my Han family disciples?”
 The Han family’s master mocked, causing the atmosphere to instantly freeze.
 The Flying Heaven Sect Master’s expression instantly turned cold, his eyes filled with killing intent.
 The head of the Han family was not afraid. The disdain on his face deepened.
 Han Yu had no choice but to say, “The two of you, it’s time to resolve the problem. Tell me, what are your conditions for you to give up?” Hearing this, the Han family’s master had no choice but to restrain his expression and give the Sages of the same generation face.
 The two mighty figures of the Immortal World began to bargain.
 At the same time, halfway up Buzhou Mountain.
 Han Jue and Han Ling were also watching.
 Han Ling sighed. “Our Han family is really domineering.”
 Han Jue smiled and said, “It’s difficult to determine karma.”
 He did not plan to interfere in this matter. The Han family was already powerful enough. Not to mention, Han Yu, Han Tuo, Han Huang, Han Qing’er, and the others could also be their backing
 At his level, he still couldn’t sense the existence of the system. That could only mean one thing. The system was unrelated to the Nine Chaos and was only related to the Primordial Fiendcelestial who had once created the Primordial Chaos.
 That Primordial Fiendcelestial was the oldest existence known.
 (Do you want to trace the origin of the system? Please choose carefully.]
 Why was it so scary?
 He even had to choose cautiously?
 “Will I die?”
 [No]
 “Will it cause substantial damage to me?”
 [No]
 Han Jue was speechless.
 He silently chose to continue.
 Boom
 Han Jue’s thoughts entered the illusion.
 A purple light dispersed the darkness, forcing him to open his eyes.
 He discovered that he had arrived in a void filled with countless purple Qi. An extremely huge sun illuminated the void in the distance. He could even feel the heat.
 Han Jue narrowed his eyes and saw a figure hidden in the huge sun.
 This was the Primordial Chaos, so only the Primordial Fiendcelestial could be in the sun.
 sun.
 “You’re finally here.”
 An indifferent tone floated over.
 Han Jue asked, “Primordial Fiendcelestial?”
 The indifferent voice replied, “No, like you, the Primordial Fiendcelestial is only a successor, but he died on the path of inheritance.”
 Han Jue was moved. It was not the Primordial Fiendcelestial?
 What was that?
 “Then who are you?” Han Jue asked in a low voice.
 He felt inexplicably uneasy.
 This was an instinctive feeling when facing the unknown.
 “My existence has no name. If you insist on giving me a name, I am the will that creates everything.”
 Creation Will?
 The indifferent voice sounded again. “There was nothing in the beginning, not even imagination. Until the creation appeared. I’m not sure how it appeared. It created a world. As the world formed, I was also born. However, this world was too tiny. I wanted to help it grow, but I couldn’t interfere in its creation. I could only transform my will into a great opportunity and enter the world. Dozens of existences obtained me before the Primordial Fiendcelestial was born. Unfortunately, they failed.
 “The Primordial Fiendcelestial is the first half-successful person. With my help, he created the Primordial Chaos, but he couldn’t improve anymore. However, he created the Primordial lifeforms before he died. An existence among the Primordial lifeforms created the Chaos.
 “I have assisted countless existences after the Primordial Fiendcelestial in the endless years. The number far exceeds your imagination. There are also my inheritors in the Nine Great Chaos. They all failed. The strongest has only reached the Great Dao Supreme Realm. Most of them fell into eternal damnation because of their arrogance.
 Han Jue frowned and asked, “Since you are the Creation Will, your goal is for me to help all of this develop better?”
 Is this my fate?
 Han Jue was thinking when countless images suddenly appeared in front of him.
 Some inheritors were born rich and arrogant. They died under the siege of powerful enemies.
 An inheritor was born alone. He liked to kill and attracted the backlash of the rules.
 Some inheritors were born poor and cultivated cautiously. After attaining the Dao, they felt invincible and acted recklessly. They were suppressed by mighty figures.
 Some inheritors relied on great opportunities to interact with people with great providence. They had immense power, but they fell into endless trouble and were finally killed because their disciples turned against them.
 Some inheritors were as cautious as Han Jue. They would ask about the risks when they encountered opportunities. As their cultivation level reached the Great Dao Supreme Realm, they felt that they were invincible in the Chaos and acted arrogantly. As time passed, they forgot to ask about the risks. The Ninth Chaos sensed that they became a Dao Creator and killed them.


 Countless inheritances of the system fell into Han Jue’s eyes, causing his heart to stir.
 Han Jue was afraid.
 He had also faced the problems these inheritors had faced. Fortunately, he kept his bottom line.
 But then again, those inheritors only faced external bewitchment. He was different. The system would try to bewitch him every time it gave him a choice.
 !!
 Damn it!
 Han Jue didn’t believe all of this.
 He asked, “Why did you choose me?”
 “That’s your luck. Every chosen successor has such doubts. I can’t answer them. It can only be your providence.”
 Han Jue wasn’t too satisfied with the answer.
 He asked, “Why is my Dao Field stronger than my cultivation level? Why aren’t there any previous inheritors?”
 “As I constantly changed inheritors, the system became stronger. When you die, this opportunity will find the next successor, and the help he receives will also be greater than
 yours.”
 The Creation Will paused for a moment and continued, “The reason why I tested you when you were chosen was also that you wasted nearly a fifth of a mortal’s lifespan for good providence. Such a situation is unprecedented.”
 Han Jue said, “Thank you for your praise.”
 Han Jue was stunned, not understanding what the Creation Will meant.
 He asked, “Can you control the system?”
 “No, I’m only a remnant will. I can’t have a substantial effect on any existence.”
 “Then, do you have anything to say to me?”
 Han Jue’s Dao heart didn’t change after he understood the system’s past. Anyway, it was right to maintain his previous attitude.
 The Creation Will was silent. The edge of the huge sun in the distance began to fluctuate, as if the heat was scorching the sky.
 After a long while…
 The Creation Will’s voice slowly floated over. “Just like the Heavenly Dao, although the Heavenly Dao gives birth to a will, the Heavenly Dao itself also exists. Unconsciously, there is always a power that restricts the development of all of this. As for what it is, I’m not sure either. Even I can’t imagine what exists outside of all of this. What’s the meaning of my birth?
 “Perhaps you can see through the meaning of existence when you reach the Creator Lord Realm.”
 With that, the illusion shattered.
 “Remember, the strongest is not eternal. Even if you’re the strongest, you will be surpassed sooner or later if you stop cultivating. There is no lack of strongest people from various eras among the previous inheritors. Most of them got lazy and were surpassed by those who came later.
 “Always remember how you got to this point.”
 The Creation Will’s voice became more and more ethereal.
 Han Jue felt bored.
 It turned out that he was not the Primordial Fiendcelestial’s reincarnation. He was only one of the countless inheritors chosen.
 He had been thinking too much.
 Before this, he was still wondering if he was the Primordial Fiendcelestial’s reincarnation. Before he died, he had created a golden finger for himself, or that the system was given by the future him.
 He had seen an online novel on Earth in the past. It was set like this.
 He had to be wary of the so-called Creation Will.
 Han Jue felt that this fellow’s self-introduction was a little dangerous. Why would he leave behind a remnant will if he had no desires?
 Han Jue didn’t ask the system. He couldn’t tell if the Creation Will could control the system.
 The Creator Lord Realm was not enough!
 In order to be stable, he had to at least surpass the Creator Lord Realm before he could challenge the goal mentioned by the Creation Will.
 Han Jue couldn’t act according to others’ thoughts. He had to always be ahead of others and above them.
 Han Ling couldn’t help but laugh. “Father, these so-called mighty figures in the Immortal World are like mortals. They’re boring.”
 This matter seemed to have ended, but there was trouble ahead.
 Han Jue deduced that the karma between the two of them was already deep. There would definitely be a shocking battle between the two forces. This also involved Han Ye and Han Yao.
 Especially Han Ye. The Flying Heaven Sect would be Han Ye’s stepping stone to attain the Dao.
 Han Jue began to look forward to that day, but this karma would have already ended when he came out of seclusion the next time.
 The father and daughter stood up and left for the Chaos.
 Several decades later, they returned to the third Dao Field.
 Han Jue directly moved Han Yao into the third Dao Field and created a clone to teach him. His main body began to enter seclusion.
 Han Yao was handsome and suave. Since he looked like Han Jue, he attracted Xing Hongxuan and the other women’s attention.
 At first, Han Yao panicked. After Han Jue’s explanation, the panic turned into surprise. He knelt down to the ancestor and began to enjoy the first opportunity of his life.
 Han Ling was very interested in Han Yao. She wanted to see how powerful this descendant her father had made an exception to take in was. In the end, he was not outstanding.
 The Conquest Heavenly Star required battles to grow. Only then could his potential and strength transform. The current Han Yao and Han Ye were the same. They had yet to show their potential.
 After losing interest, Han Ling no longer paid attention to Han Yao.
 Han Yao usually meditated and cultivated. Every time he broke through, Han Jue’s clone would teach him a Mystical Power and preach the Dao.
 Even Xing Hongxuan could tell that Han Jue thought highly of Han Yao. Other than his own son, no one else had such treatment.
 No, even his own son was inferior. Han Jue didn’t specially create clones to treat Han Huang and his children.
 Ten thousand years later.
 This time, a peerless prodigy had descended.
 More than three hundred thousand years later.
 Han Jue was still cultivating in seclusion when a notification appeared in front of him.
 (The Evil Heavenly Emperor sent you a dream. Do you accept?]
 It was very difficult for all living beings to visit him in his dreams after he became a Dao Creator. However, he gave special privileges to the people he cared about to prevent them from encountering danger.
 Han Jue hesitated for a moment but still agreed to the Evil Heavenly Emperor’s request.
 The dream was a small forest outside the Jade Pure Sacred Sect. The Evil Heavenly Emperor immediately said, “I have something to ask of
 you…”
 Han Jue retracted his divine light and asked with a smile, “What is it?” He couldn’t be bothered to calculate. After not seeing him for more than twenty million years, he really missed the Evil Heavenly Emperor.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor chuckled. “I won’t stand on ceremony with you. I want Han Yao and Han Ye. I really didn’t expect that other than your own children, the Han family would actually have such stunning descendants.
 “Han Yao has already been chosen by the Heavenly Dao as the number one prodigy of the current generation. That Han Ye is even more impressive. He killed his way from the mortal world to the Immortal World and then to the Chaos. He’s like a god of slaughter. Leave him to me. It just so happens that he has the temperament to lead the righteous path.
 “You’re busy cultivating and shouldn’t have time to care about them, right?”


 “I indeed don’t have the time to care about them, but I can’t control their wishes. If you can rope them in, I naturally have no objections.”
 Han Jue smiled. He could allow some things, but he couldn’t arrange them directly.
 His attitude might affect his descendants. If he advocated, what would the Han family think? Wouldn’t they be controlled by the Evil Heavenly Emperor in the future?
 !!
 In addition, behind the Evil Heavenly Emperor stood the Formless Transcendent Deity. Although he was suppressed by the Ninth Chaos, he could return in a hundred million years.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor smiled and said, “That’s good. It’s fine as long as you agree. After all, they’re the precious geniuses of your Han family. I can’t poach them all. I have to ask for your approval. Don’t worry, I’m only nurturing them for a period of time. They can leave at any time when they grow up, just like Tuo’er, Huang’er, and Jiang Jueshi.”
 Han Jue wasn’t surprised that Han Huang and Jiang Jueshi had already left the Heavenly Court. He didn’t ask further.
 The two of them began to reminisce and sighed.
 As time passed, there were fewer and fewer old friends. There were naturally even fewer old friends who were close.
 The two of them chatted for a long time.
 Han Jue continued cultivating after the dream ended.
 Heavenly Dao, outside the 33rd Heaven.
 In the Universal Hall, a group of ancient Sages sat side by side. Two figures stood in the hall. They were Han Yao and Han Ye.
 Han Yao wore silver armor and was handsome like an immortal who had walked out of a painting
 Han Ye was dressed in black. His long hair was tied behind his head with a grass rope, and two strands of long hair were left on his forehead. He was also handsome, but his eyes were filled with killing intent and he had an unruly smile.
 These two were the strongest geniuses of the Heavenly Dao in the past million years. They were both descendants of the Divine Might Heavenly Sage.
 The Sages sized up the two of them and were satisfied.
 Long Hao smiled and said, “They have the bearing of Junior Tuo and Junior Huang back then.”
 The other Sages nodded. Han Yao glanced at Han Ye with a meaningful gaze.
 Han Ye said, “Everyone, why did you call me here? I don’t want to stay in the same hall as this fellow. You can forget about subduing me. Although I, Han Ye, am born as a mortal, my pride surpasses that of a Sage!” Li Taigu smiled teasingly. “Kid, you’re very arrogant. It’s indeed impressive that you killed the entire Sect, but you also offended many Sages because of this. If not for us protecting you, do you really think you could survive?”
 Han Ye smiled. “If not, how can we reconcile? The Heavenly Dao has so many geniuses. Isn’t there one in front of me? In the end, you’re still afraid of my power and afraid that I’ll perish with the Heavenly Dao!
 “Let’s not talk nonsense. I, Han Ye, am preparing to leave the Heavenly Dao. I’m here to bid farewell to you. I was born in the Heavenly Dao. It is my home. I will naturally return if the Heavenly Dao is in trouble in the future!”
 With that, Han Ye turned around and left.
 Li Taigu was so angry that he wanted to attack, but he was stopped by Heavenly Venerate Wufa.
 Heavenly Venerate Wufa smiled and said, “This kid is really vicious. It’s good that he left. Staying in the Heavenly Dao will only cause trouble. He will understand our intentions after he trains in the Chaos and learns his lesson.”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du nodded. Seeing this, the other Sages did not say anything.
 Their gazes landed on Han Yao next.
 Han Yao was indifferent to Han Ye’s departure. He didn’t like him, to begin with.
 The two of them were known as the two peerless geniuses of the Han family, but Han Yao had always looked down on Han Ye and felt that he was too murderous.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du looked at him and said, “Han Yao, the Chaotic Heavenly Court’s Evil Heavenly Emperor wants to invite you to the Heavenly Court to cultivate. Are you willing to go?”
 Han Yao frowned.
 Fang Liang smiled. “Your Han family’s ancestors have all served in the Heavenly Court. Now, the Divine Punisher is above the Chaotic Great Dao Divine Spirit. Furthermore, you can fight well. The Heavenly Court is very suitable for you. We all think that you can go and release your nature.
 “In addition, recently, the Eternal Peak’s Han Huang is also in the Heavenly Court. You’ve also wandered the Chaos before. You should have heard of Han Huang’s reputation, right?”
 Han Yao’s eyes lit up. “Han Huang is the ancestor of my Han family. I’ve naturally heard of him. I’m willing to go!”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du looked at Han Yu and said, “Han Yu, bring your juniors personally. I need you to lead the way.”
 Han Yu agreed.
 Han Yao’s thoughts drifted to the Heavenly Court.
 He wanted to see Han Huang, the prodigy who stood above the peak of the Chaos, the greatest glory of the Han family!
 Han Yunjin had erected Han Tuo’s and Han Huang’s monuments in the ancestral hall when he established the Han family. He had recorded the legends of his two brothers to let the descendants of the main family read them since they were young.
 Han Yao had been taught by Han Jue for ten thousand years when he was young. He was often mentioned by the disciples of the Dao Field in the third Dao Field.
 He knew more about Han Huang than all living beings.
 Born as Freedom, unparalleled in the world! That was the goal he should pursue! Just like that, Han Yu left with Han Yao.
 Sect Master Tian Jue said faintly, “Everyone, there seems to be a fate between Han Yao and Han Ye. Have you deduced it?”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du frowned.
 The Sages nodded.
 These words determined their attitude.
 If the two were irreconcilable and only one could exist, they would protect Han Yao!
 Although Han Ye was also a descendant of the Divine Might Heavenly Sage, the Han family had many children. There was a difference in status among them.
 In the Chaotic Void, an ancient pagoda slowly advanced. Four figures sat on the pagoda’s surface.
 They were Dao Sovereign, Zhao Xuanyuan, Jiang Yi, and Lao Dan.
 Zhao Xuanyuan smiled and asked, “Where are we going next?”
 Dao Sovereign did not answer. Lao Dan smiled and said, “It depends on fate. Traveling the Chaos is also a form of cultivation.”
 At this moment, Jiang Yi suddenly opened his eyes and frowned. “What a strong killing intent. The world ahead is being slaughtered!”
 Zhao Xuanyuan narrowed his eyes and looked over. His gaze passed through the Chaotic Void and reached the dilapidated world that was far beyond the reach of mortals.
 Corpses were everywhere and a ferocious aura surged.
 In the dilapidated world was a sea of blood. Above the sea of blood stood a figure. It was Han Ye. He was absorbing the blood aura. His long hair fluttered wantonly, like a ferocious god.


 “That kid is a little evil. He’s actually absorbing killing intent.”
 Zhao Xuanyuan looked at Han Ye and clicked his tongue in wonder.
 Jiang Yi pinched his fingers to deduce and said, “This world has been invaded by demons and billions of living beings have been possessed. The negative karma is monstrous. Being slaughtered by this child is considered enforcing justice on behalf of the heavens.”
 “Let’s go and take a look?”
 “Sure!”
 The ancient pagoda began to rush in Han Ye’s direction.
 They arrived in the dilapidated world not long after.
 In the sea of blood, Han Ye, who was meditating in the air, suddenly opened his eyes. Blood light flashed in his eyes, causing the surrounding blood aura to instantly stop.
 Han Ye looked at the ancient pagoda and frowned slightly.
 Zhao Xuanyuan’s laughter sounded. “Kid, why can you absorb killing intent?”
 Jiang Yi began to deduce Han Ye’s background. Then, his expression changed.
 He immediately sent a voice transmission to Zhao Xuanyuan, who also became stunned.
 Dao Sovereign also opened his eyes and looked at Han Ye.
 Han Ye snorted upon facing the four unfamiliar and mysterious cultivators. “What does it have to do with you? Don’t disturb
 me!”
 Zhao Xuanyuan was amused and smiled. “Very arrogant!”
 Han Ye took out the World Piercing Divine Origin Bow and held it in his right hand. A terrifying murderous aura enveloped the world.
 Dao Sovereign and the other three frowned when they saw the bow.
 What a domineering bow!
 They actually felt a trace of fear.
 Very few Dharma treasures could make them uneasy at first glance.
 Jiang Yi sent a voice transmission to Zhao Xuanyuan, “Do you think it’s a Dharma treasure given to him by the Sect Master? Such a treasure can’t exist in the Heavenly Dao. It’s definitely a Chaotic Supreme Treasure!”
 Zhao Xuanyuan felt that it made sense and looked at Han Ye with a gentle gaze.
 Han Jue had countless descendants. Not every descendant could make them give him face, but to be able to obtain Han Jue’s Supreme Treasure was different.
 Dao Sovereign said, “Join us.”
 His voice was extremely loud, like a bell ringing in Han Ye’s ears.
 Han Ye raised his right arm straight and pulled the bowstring with his left hand. There were no arrows, but a terrifying pressure erupted, causing the dilapidated world to tremble violently.
 Dao Sovereign and the other three were moved. What a terrifying bow!
 “I’ll give you another chance. Scram!” Han Ye shouted expressionlessly.
 Zhao Xuanyuan teased. “You want to kill the four of us with a bow? Do you know who we
 are?”
 Killing intent burst out from Han Ye’s eyes, scaring Lao Dan so much that he hurriedly shouted, “Stop, we’re all on the same side! Don’t act recklessly!”
 Han Ye was stunned. On the same side?
 Lao Dan glared at Zhao Xuanyuan and then back at Han Ye. “The three of them are personal disciples of the Hidden Sect’s Divine Might Heavenly Sage.” Han Ye frowned.
 He knew about the Hidden Sect, but he had never thought of himself as a member of the Han family.
 He had relied on himself all along. His parents had long died of old age and entered the cycle of reincarnation.
 The Han family came to find him after he became stronger. This made him look down on them.
 As for the Divine Might Heavenly Sage, this figure was too far away. He rarely thought about it.
 “Hmph! So what if it’s the Hidden Sect? I gave you a chance. You insisted on pestering me!”
 Han Ye suddenly released his left hand and the bowstring retracted. A red arrow aura suddenly shot out and tore through the Chaotic Space. It was like a blood-colored torrent that attacked Dao Sovereign and the other three.
 Extremely fast!
 Dao Sovereign instantly appeared in front of the ancient pagoda. He raised his hand to block the arrow aura of the World Piercing Divine Origin Bow and crushed it with one hand. However, after the arrow aura dissipated, it turned into countless blood threads that entered his body and crazily destroyed his Dharmic powers and Dao Fruit.
 Dao Sovereign frowned and dispersed it with his Supreme Power.
 Zhao Xuanyuan cursed. “Brat, you’re so arrogant! In that case, I’ll teach you a lesson first!”
 With that, he suddenly appeared behind Han Ye. The difference in cultivation between the two was too great. Zhao Xuanyuan pressed down on his shoulder before Han Ye could
 Han Ye’s expression changed drastically. He subconsciously wanted to turn around, but his soul was suddenly severely injured. He fell into a daze and his body trembled.
 Zhao Xuanyuan raised his hand and pulled Han Ye’s soul out of his body. He took out a green jade mirror and sealed his soul in it.
 Han Ye panicked slightly. He glared at Zhao Xuanyuan outside the mirror and cursed. “Dog! What are you doing?”
 Zhao Xuanyuan smiled and said, “Your mouth is really smelly!”
 Han Ye cursed. “Feel free if you want to kill or torture me. You’ll still be a dog in my eyes!”
 Zhao Xuanyuan’s expression turned cold. Just as he was about to speak, Dao Sovereign appeared beside him and said, “We were indeed the ones who disturbed him. If it were you, would you believe him if he revealed his identity?”
 Zhao Xuanyuan’s expression softened.
 Jiang Yi and Lao Dan also rushed over to persuade him.
 Zhao Xuanyuan could only give up.
 Dao Sovereign looked at Han Ye in the mirror and said, “You slaughtered the world wantonly. Even if it’s a world filled with sins, it will attract trouble sooner or later. You’re not qualified to act recklessly in the Chaos with your strength.”
 Han Ye was silent.
 Lao Dan smiled and said, “Let me introduce you to them. This is one of the Ten Absolute Prodigies of the previous Chaotic Assembly. Now that he’s a Great Dao Divine Spirit, with him as your backing, won’t it help you?”
 Han Ye said angrily, “I, Han Ye, will only bow to three people in this life. My parents are already dead. I will only respect one person in this life. Don’t try to break my pride!”
 Dao Sovereign was amused.
 Zhao Xuanyuan and the other two could also tell that Han Jue was that person. In that case, they couldn’t bully Han Ye. Otherwise, if Han Jue knew…
 They had to believe that he cared.
 Time passed quickly.
 Han Jue opened his eyes, indicating that five million years had passed.
 The Ultimate Origin World developed well in the past five million years. More and more stars were born, turning into a galaxy and then into a huge world.
 Those Chaotic Fiendcelestials each guarded an area. Under the guidance of Han Jue’s will, they began to serve as creation gods, establishing rules and order and creating all sorts of miracles. The Connate lifeforms of the Ultimate Origin World also began to ascend the stage one after another. The number was immeasurable, but they were still very rare in the vast Ultimate Origin World. Connate lifeforms rarely interacted, mainly because they could not be seen.
 Han Jue began the simulation trial and challenged the Formless Transcendent Deity.
 Ten Formless Transcendent Deities were no longer enough for him to kill.
 He directly challenged a hundred Formless Transcendent Deities!
 Victory!
 Han Jue suddenly rejoiced. Fortunately, he had never exposed the Ultimate Origin World’s existence. His Great Dao World would be suppressed just like the Chaotic Consciousness’ and the Formless Transcendent Deity’s Great Dao Worlds. It would be difficult for him to improve then.
 Han Jue began to check his emails, wanting to see if there had been any changes in the past five million years.
 Soon, he frowned.


 (Your grand-disciple Han Yao received guidance from your good friend Evil Heavenly Emperor and learned a Mystical Power.]
 (Your son Han Huang has entered the Transcendent Great Dao World.]
 (Your good friend, the Ultimate God of Punishment, has entered the Transcendent Great Dao World.)
 [Your son Han Tuo was cursed by a mysterious curse.]
 [Your disciple Jiang Jueshi created a Mystical Power. Millions of clones fell into the cycle of reincarnation.]
 (Your good friend Pangu has entered the Transcendent Great Dao World.)
 Transcendent Great Dao World?
 Han Jue frowned. Wasn’t the Formless Transcendent Deity suppressed? Why was the Great Dao World exposed?
 There had to be a scheme!
 The Number One Deity had been suppressed by the Great Dao Divine Spirits ever since the Chaotic Assembly ended, and the Consciousnessless Great Dao World had begun to be invaded by the various Chaotic forces. The Consciousnessless Great Dao World had already been tainted by the providence of the Chaos and was on the verge of fusing after more than twenty million years of development.
 Could it be that the Ninth Chaos wanted to fuse with their Great Dao World while the two Dao Creators were suppressed?
 If his guess was correct, then the Ninth Chaos was too ruthless. This move might cause the two Dao Creator’s cultivation to fall a major realm!
 Han Jue couldn’t expose the Ultimate Origin World to avoid being targeted by the Ninth Chaos.
 He was also very interested in the Transcendent Great Dao World. Therefore, he created a clone and went to investigate it.
 As for his main body, it was better to stay in the Dao Field.
 “Father, what are you thinking?”
 Han Ling’s voice floated over, her tone a little excited.
 Han Jue glanced at her and knew what she was thinking. “Come.”
 The father and daughter entered the simulation trial and opened their eyes the next second.
 Han Ling sighed.
 It still did not work.
 She looked up again and said, “Father, stand still and let me fight. Try my Mystical Power.”
 Han Jue had no choice but to agree.
 An hour later.
 The simulation ended.
 Han Ling sighed. “Father, you’re really powerful. Even though my ten million Emperor Soldiers can gather into a formation, they can’t break through your robe’s restriction.”
 Han Jue smiled. “Nonsense. I’m your father.”
 Han Ling curled her lips and said, “Father, do you think I can obtain the Eternal Peak if I participate in the Chaotic Assembly?”
 “Oh? You want to?”
 Han Jue rolled his eyes. Was this how a woman should be?
 He had discovered that Han Ling was unhappy with Han Yao and Han Ye. He did not expect this girl to actually want to participate in the Chaotic Assembly to stop them.
 Han Ling covered her mouth and laughed. “Father, I’m teasing you. I know that you cherish those two brats. Why would I suppress them?”
 Han Jue smiled. “You’re also their ancestor. Don’t treat them as peers. They can also help you if they can grow up and you have great ambitions in the future.”
 The Primordial Emperor Star was born as an Emperor!
 Han Jue wouldn’t be deceived by Han Ling’s appearance. This girl looked obedient, but arrogance always existed in her heart. It was actually very easy to guess Han Ling’s thoughts. Why did she always challenge Han Jue? It was because she used him as a standard. She would be able to rule the Chaos as long as she defeated him.
 Han Ling couldn’t help but think when she heard that.
 Han Jue continued to read the emails. How many emails had he accumulated in five million years? Every email was equivalent to a fragment of one’s life. It could be an opportunity or a calamity.
 Han Ling was still thinking after he finished reading the emails. He stood up and went to visit his Dao Companions.
 Several decades later.
 In the second Dao Field.
 Han Jue sat opposite dozens of Chaotic Fiendcelestials and was discussing the Dao.
 Murong Qi said, “Grandmaster, recently, a world has been created in the depths of my soul. This world is closely related to my cultivation. Why is that?”
 He had seen the power of the world at the Chaotic Assembly. It was indeed powerful, but at that time, he thought it was a Mystical Power. Only when he cultivated a world did he realize that this was a realm.
 Han Jue said, “You have to create a world if you want to go beyond the Great Dao Supreme Realm. Previously, the place where the Ten Absolutes of the Chaos fought was the Consciousnessless Great Dao World. It was a world made by a transcendent existence.”
 Great Loose Heaven was moved. “In that case, could it be that the Chaos is also…”
 Han Jue smiled and nodded.
 He didn’t have to worry about being spied on by the Ninth Chaos in the second Dao Field.
 Regarding the Great Dao World’s secrets, Han Jue also planned to use this opportunity to tell his personal disciples in front of him. They were all trusted aides. The Chaotic Fiendcelestial’s potential was too strong. If not for him leading the way, he could only reach this step in his seclusion.
 Han Jue explained his understanding of the Great Dao World, causing the dozens of Chaotic Fiendcelestials to fall into deep thought.
 After a long while…
 Dao Comprehension Sword asked curiously, “Master, what about your Great Dao World?”
 Han Jue smiled and didn’t say anything.
 The Black Hell Chicken shouted, “Don’t ask nonsense. If you ask, the answer is no. It’s the same for the others. How vast is the Consciousnessless Great Dao World? It’s even suppressed under the Chaos. This means that the Lord of Chaos is petty. Once he discovers…”
 The Fiendcelestials were moved, and Dao Comprehension Sword’s face turned pale.
 Han Jue said, “You have to be careful when you travel the Chaos in the future. With your cultivation levels, you seem to be above all living beings, but you should be able to sense that this Chaos is still very unfamiliar. The higher you stand, the more you should understand. Many rules and existences are unimaginable, and behind this unimaginable existence is a transcendent existence that far exceeds us.”
 The Fiendcelestials nodded.
 Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial said, “We won’t go out. We’ll stay in each other’s Great Dao World and not cause trouble for Master if we’re bored in the future.”
 The other Fiendcelestials agreed, making Han Jue very satisfied.
 They needed an extremely long time to cultivate a Great Dao World.
 Several years later.
 Han Jue returned to the third Dao Field and prepared to continue cultivating.
 He suddenly thought of Hong Jun in the universe of stars.
 He focused his gaze and saw that Hong Jun was no longer in the universe of stars. However, Liu Bei was still there.
 He began to deduce Hong Jun and discovered that he had left after attaining Freedom. Now, he was preaching the Dao in a corner of the Chaos and spreading his teachings.
 It seemed like he was preparing for the Dao Ancestor’s return.
 Han Jue clicked his tongue in wonder. What did the Dao Ancestor want?
 Why hadn’t he appeared now that the Heavenly Dao and the Chaos were peaceful?
 It seemed that the Dao Ancestor had also established his own Great Dao World and was very powerful. Was he afraid of being discovered by the Ninth Chaos?
 [The Nine-Headed Divine Spirit sent you a dream. Do you accept?]
 A notification suddenly appeared in front of him, making Han Jue frown.
 Wasn’t the Nine-Headed Divine Spirit already demoted to the mortal world by the Ninth Chaos?
 How could he send a dream?
 Could it be that after more than twenty million years, this fellow had already grown
 up?
 Han Jue hesitated for a moment before choosing to accept the dream.
 The dream was a blank domain. Han Jue saw the Nine-Headed Divine Spirit covered in the divine light of the Supreme Rules.
 When enemies met, they fell silent.
 A moment later, the Nine-Headed Divine Spirit said, “It’s time for the Primordial Fiendcelestial to appear!”
