Han Huang took a deep breath upon hearing his father’s answer. He also felt pressure, but he felt more motivated.
Come and kill me!
I want to see who can kill me!
Han Huang looked at his father and saw him smiling. The pressure in his heart vanished.
If his father was not worried about him, what was he worried about?
He would be truly invincible in the Chaos if he could survive the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity and laugh until the Endless Era. He would not let down the name of the Primordial Fiendcelestial!
Han Huang stood up and bid farewell.
He had waited for millions of years for these words.
Han Jue looked at his departing figure and sighed secretly.
Brat, you don’t even know how to greet me. Can’t you talk to your father more?
Ask me how strong I am now!
Not giving me a chance to show off?
Then you have to suffer more in the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity!
Han Jue snorted. He would definitely delay his arrival if Han Huang was suppressed.
Ancestor Han Huang was going to stir up the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity and would definitely attract countless hatred. He felt that he could help him.
After following Han Jue for so long, under his influence, Shan’e’s situation was also very high. He was not high and mighty, but he thought from the perspective of all living beings.
The Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity looked like a calamity and was a devastating disaster for all living beings, but they had never seen it. This was an unprecedented opportunity!
Countless Great Dao Worlds like the Chaos would be born when the Endless Era arrived. The number of living beings would multiply endlessly. Sacrificing oneself to help the greater one, why not?
Even mortals knew how to sacrifice a small number to benefit the majority. Everything
focused on the majority.
Han Jue closed his eyes and said, “We’ll see. It’s not impossible.”
Shan’e immediately beamed.
One couldn’t curse the enemy behind their back in the simulation trial. If the enemy attacked directly, the Great Dao of Curses would be useless.
Han Jue began to observe the Chaos and the Ultimate Origin World.
…
Creation Emperor Court, Heavenly Hall.
Han Huang told Han Ling his intentions, and
Han Ling fell silent.
After a long while…
Han Ling sighed. “Must that be the case?”
Han Huang smiled. “I have to. Instead of
giving the advantage to others, why don’t I give it to you? I’ll tell you in advance. This way,
you can lessen the burden.”
Han Ling frowned. “What will you do if I stand on the same side as all living beings?”
“Hahaha-“|
Han Huang laughed loudly. “Fourth Sister, do
you think I’ll die? Impossible!”
With that, he turned around and left.
He suddenly stopped in his tracks and said, “Don’t tell Han Ye about this. I need this kid to
face me with all his might!’
Han Ling looked at Han Huang’s departing figure with flickering eyes.
That day, Han Ling gave the order that Han
Apart from the Emperor, Han Ye, Han Yao, and
Below the three of them, countless experts and geniuses were trying to break through. Although the current Creation Emperor Court had not expanded, its foundation had increased
crazily. The various factions in the Transcendent Domain were terrified.
An unprecedented colossus was rising!
…
Han Huang vanished without a trace after betraying the Creation Emperor Court.
Ten million years later.
Han Huang married Goddess Ming Ji. Goddess Ming Ji’s father represented his faction and announced that Han Huang would be the
leader. For a time, the entire Chaos was in an uproar. Han Huang, who had disappeared for a long time, had transformed into the master of an overlord faction.
This faction was renamed the Primordial Chaos. The Primordial Chaos covered dozens of
The situation in the Chaos began to change after Han Huang established his faction. The Primordial Chaos had already appeared. The Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity was not far away.
All the mighty figures knew that Han Huang
would stir up the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity, but they did not know when it would
happen. They didn’t dare to take the initiative to provoke him.
Ten million years passed in the blink of an eye. Han Jue had been in seclusion for 50 million years and he had reached 370 million years of
age. He was trying to break through to the Creator Lord Realm.
Han Jue looked forward to this realm after
reaching the perfected Dao Creator Realm. However, although his cultivation level was still increasing, he needed help finding the opportunity to break through.
He felt that he was missing something. Han Jue opened his eyes and started to think.
What was lacking?
The Ninth Chaos wanted to rely on the Endless
was for the Chaos to shatter and break through to the blank domain.
Could it be that he had to do the same?
one Creator Lord then?
No.
He didn’t have to start the Endless Era. That
was only the Ninth Chaos’ guess.
Han Jue’s Ultimate Origin World was far from
the limit.
It seemed that the hope of breaking through
still rested on it.
Han Jue immediately left a clone and jumped
into the Ultimate Origin World. Although there was no Dao Field in the
Ultimate Origin World, he was not afraid of
attacks. Now, only the Ninth Chaos was a threat to him, and it could not kill him. Han Jue opened a palace that all living beings
couldn’t see at the peak of the Ultimate Origin World, above the Eight Supreme Rules. His
main body sat in the palace and looked down at the Chaos.
The ninth Supreme Rule was being nurtured and could be born anytime. Han Jue was looking forward to this. The
eighth Supreme Rule allowed the Ultimate Origin World to obtain the ability to devour other Great Dao Worlds. What would the ninth Supreme Rule be?
Han Jue waited patiently as he cultivated. Millions of years later.
The ninth Supreme Rule was finally born.
Han Jue sensed carefully. This rule was actually similar to breaking the rules.
The Ultimate Origin World would keep destroying the blank domain, causing itself to expand infinitely. Wasn’t that the Endless Era!
Excited, Han Jue immediately mobilized the Ultimate Origin World’s power.
As expected, the Ultimate Origin World’s power could shatter the blank domain and increase his space. Space could expand infinitely. However,
the
Great Dao World could no longer expand because of the blank domain’s restriction. Han Jue wouldn’t need the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity if the Ultimate Origin World expanded infinitely because of this. “The Great Dao World is the current
He could sense that the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity’s aura was approaching the Chaos. It turned out that the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity could not be stirred up just because he wanted to. Supreme
karma would descend and drive all living beings to fight.
Although the Chaos had experienced several calamities, there was no supreme karma of the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity, so the Endless Era had never arrived.


 Calamity
 After knowing that his Dao attainment path was safe, Han Jue left a clone in the palace and his main body returned to the third Daoist temple.
 Shan’e didn’t sense that he had left. The alternation between the clone and the main body was extremely fast. Even a perfected Great Dao Supreme like Shan’e couldn’t sense it.
 Han Jue had twenty-five Creation Heaven’s Chosen attempts now. He hesitated to use them.
 He gave up after thinking about it.
 He would use it when the Endless Era arrived. At that time, dozens of Creation Heaven’s Chosen would gather together and be nurtured by him. Then, he would let them out to make a name for themselves. It would be simply
 awesome.
 If such words spread, how impressive would that be?
 Han Jue thought silently and looked forward to it.
 Of course, it was just a thought. He would find it annoying if that really happened.
 Han Jue wouldn’t deliberately suppress the juniors in the future, but it was best for the majority of his own people to be in the ranks of Dao Creators.
 He could never lose his vigilance!
 This was how the Ninth Chaos was
 counterattacked.
 Han Jue began to check his emails to see how his friends had been all these years.
 [Your son Han Huang created the Primordial Demon Soldier. His providence has declined.]
 [Your good friend Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction Venerable was attacked by your good friend Ninth Chaos.]
 [Your good friend Evil Heavenly Emperor has received guidance from your good friend Formless Transcendent Deity. His cultivation has increased greatly.]
 [Your good friend Huang Zuntian’s soul has transformed into a Primordial Soul. His
 providence has transformed.]
 [Your disciple Jiang Jueshi has entered Chaotic
 Reincarnation.]
 [Your son Han Huang was cursed by a
 mysterious curse.]
 [Your descendant Han Ye was attacked by a
 mysterious mighty figure and was severely
 injured.]
 [Your disciple Su Qi spread bad luck and was
 expelled by Shi Tian’s rules.]
 Primordial Demon Soldier?
 What a show!
 He probably wanted to nurture a force and stir
 up the entire Chaos.
 Han Jue was a little disdainful.
 He continued reading. He frowned at Su Qi’s
 encounter.
 Shi Tian’s rules could still expel people. It was clearly Shi Tian’s Immeasurable Destruction Venerable’s intention. However, he didn’t dare to fall out with Han Jue, so he didn’t kill him.
 In that case, Han Jue couldn’t be bothered. It was good that Su Qi was wandering around.
 It could pave the way for Han Huang. The more chaotic the Chaos was, the more dangerous the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity would be. The chances of Han Huang surviving also increased. Su Qi was equivalent to Han Huang’s helper.
 Han Jue suddenly had an idea.
 Should he tell the other disciples to help Han
 Huang and share the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity’s creation?
 Many sides were fighting Han Huang. It was very difficult to obtain a Great Creation, but it was different.
 Han Jue thought for a moment and felt that it was troublesome. He would let nature take its
 course.
 After reading the emails, Han Jue stood up and walked out of the Daoist temple to visit his Dao Companions. He spent thousands of years visiting them one by one.
 Han Jue left Xing Hongxuan’s Daoist temple for
 mentioned Han Huang. “He betrayed the Creation Emperor Court and even took in that demoness’s force. Will he take the wrong path?”
 Han Jue didn’t hide anything and told her Han Huang’s difficulties and goals.
 Xing Hongxuan was shocked and nervous upon
 hearing that Han Huang was about to destroy the Chaos.
 “Husband, this is the path to death.” Xing Hongxuan grabbed his hand and pitifully pleaded with him.
 She knew that only Han Jue could convince her
 son.
 Han Jue smiled and said, “I support him.”
 He then explained the perspective of the Chaos
 and the Endless Era. Han Huang seemed to be doing evil, but he was actually doing an unprecedented great creation.
 those transcendent existences above the Chaos attack him? Won’t that cause trouble for you?” Xing Hongxuan frowned.
 Han Jue smiled. “I’m only telling you. Don’t
 tell the others.”
 “Hmm?”
 “The existence who created the Chaos is no
 longer my match, and there are only a few Dao Creators above the Great Dao. None of them is my match.”
 This was the first time Han Jue forcefully postured, but it was not awkward. What he said
 was the truth.
 Xing Hongxuan widened her beautiful eyes and
 asked, “You’re already invincible?” “That’s right!”
 “Isn’t there always someone stronger? Are you
 sure there are no realms above the Dao Creator
 Realm?”
 “No. The Dao Creator Realm has been the limit
 ever since the Primordial Chaos was born.
 There’s no stronger.”
 “Waa—”
 Xing Hongxuan was moved. Her body trembled
 in shock.
 She had always felt that Han Jue’s talent was unparalleled and she had always believed in him.
 But what did invincibility mean?
 She couldn’t even imagine it.
 “Can you create living beings now?” “Aren’t the disciples outside the Dao Field?” “What about destroying the Chaos?”
 “Is everything just a thought for you?”
 “You’re undying and indestructible?” “I have already transformed into countless will Dharma Idols that are eternal.”
 “Then, can you increase our cultivation level?”
 “Yes, but just Great Dao Supreme Realm at the most. You must rely on yourself if you want to break through to the Dao Creator Realm. Therefore, it’s best to stabilize your Dao heart first.”
 “Do you have a Great Dao World?”
 “Of course.”
 Xing Hongxuan kept asking questions. Han Jue replied patiently, feeling extremely refreshed.
 His wife was the best. She understood his
 needs. Ask, ask with all your might!
 It was also very satisfying to show off!
 After a long time, Xing Hongxuan excitedly pulled Han Jue along to cultivate. Han Jue only returned to his Daoist temple
 after thousands of years. Next was to wait for the Great Dao
 Immeasurable Calamity to arrive!
 Han Huang created the Primordial Demon Soldiers. As the number of Primordial Demon Soldiers increased, the spies of the various factions lurking in the Primordial Chaos faction also discovered this matter. The various factions were alarmed and began accumulating their strength and even beginning to rope them
 in.
 As the strongest force in the Chaos, the news reached their ears at the Great Dao Divine Spirit
 level.
 The Ultimate God of Punishment was also alarmed and did not dare to act anymore. He gathered the Great Dao Divine Spirits together. “Han Huang wants to destroy the Chaos and
 create the Primordial Chaos. This is the calamity!”
 “The Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity’s karma has arrived. We should be able to sense it. Perhaps he’s wrapped in this karma.” “So what? We have to stop it. We’ll die too if the Chaos is gone!”
 “You have to know that other than the Great
 Dao Supremes, even Great Dao Sages can’t survive in the blank domain.”
 “I have to suppress the Primordial Chaos!”
 The Great Dao Divine Spirits discussed. Even Han Tuo, Dao Sovereign, Murong Qi, and the
 other Great Dao Divine Spirits of the Hidden Sect were moved.
 Was Han Huang crazy?
 Yi Tian grinned. “As expected of your second
 brother. He defeated all the living beings in the Chaos and still wants to do something greater.” However, his smile was a little cold. The Chaos
 also involved his personal benefits. The Ultimate God of Punishment said, “Han Huang has already grown up. What should we do even if we want to suppress him?” He could no longer protect Han Huang. This fellow’s ambitions were too obvious. He even had no intention of hiding it. Even those at the
 Freedom Realm were spreading this matter. Laozi said, “The Chaos alone won’t do. We
 better join forces with the other Great Dao World domains.”
 Han Huang was undoubtedly powerful, just like
 the Divine Might Heavenly Sage back then. However, he was stronger and more dangerous
 than the Divine Might Heavenly Sage.


Laozi’s suggestion met the Great Dao Divine Spirits’ agreement.
The living beings of the Chaos were no longer Han Huang’s match. They had to join forces with the other Great Dao World domains to have a chance of winning.
The Ultimate God of Punishment sighed in his heart. Under the excitement of the crowd, he had no choice but to start giving orders to let the Great Dao Divine Spirits rope him in separately.
The gods left after everything was said.
The Ultimate God of Punishment returned to his space and sent a dream to Han Jue.
He rarely visited in his dreams, so Han Jue accepted it.
In the dream.
The Ultimate God of Punishment quickly explained Han Huang’s situation.
“This matter threatens the entire Chaos. I have no choice but to take advantage of the situation,” the Ultimate God of Punishment said uneasily, not knowing Han Jue’s attitude towards Han Huang.
Han Jue said, “It’s fine. Just let nature take its course. Perform your duty as the leader of the Divine Spirits. If you have to do it, you can also do it.”
“Then Han Huang…’
“This is his fate.”
“I understand.”
The Ultimate God of Punishment’s eyes flickered as he instantly thought of many possibilities.
However, he could only think and did not dare to ask.
The dream ended.
Han Jue didn’t care and continued cultivating.
Now, he only had eyes for the Creator Lord Realm.
The Ultimate Origin World kept destroying the blank domain and expanding. The Ultimate Origin Qi in the world also increased.
More and more living beings of the other Great Dao Worlds discovered the Ultimate Origin World through the netherworld. There were even situations where other living beings accepted the Ultimate Origin Qi and transformed into Ultimate Origin Lifeforms.
Han Jue only turned a blind eye to this and handed the matter to the Ultimate Origin Fiendcelestials, the Ultimate Origin Soul Race, and the Nether Race.
Currently, these three forces already dominated the Ultimate Origin World and divided it into regions. The Ultimate Origin World’s order had already been established.
The Life Fiendcelestial and Han You established the netherworld’s order together. When the living beings of the other Great Dao World entered the Ultimate Origin World, they would be captured by the Ultimate Origin Netherworld and suppressed for a period of
time before being released.
Everything about Han Jue was developing in a
good direction.
His seclusion no longer had a period. He
began to enter endless seclusion.
More than twenty million years passed in the
blink of an eye.
Han Jue was now 400 million years old.
[Detected that you are 400 million years old and your life has taken another step forward. You have the following choices:]
[1: Exit seclusion immediately and devour the other Great Dao Worlds. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment, a Primordial Fragment, a Creation Spirit Stone, and a chance to upgrade the system function.]
[2: Cultivate in a low-profile manner and maintain your original intention. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment, a Primordial Fragment, a Creation Spirit Stone, and a chance to upgrade the system function.] [You have obtained a Creation Heaven’s Chosen attempt.]
The choices were the same.
Han Jue silently chose the second option.
[You chose to cultivate in a low-profile manner and obtained a Great Dao Fragment, a Primordial Fragment, a Creation Spirit Stone, and a chance to upgrade the system function.]
Han Jue directly chose the system function.
[You chose to upgrade the Myriad Worlds Projection.]
[Myriad Worlds Projection has begun to upgrade.]
Next was to wait.
The Myriad Worlds Projection did not affect
him much, but it was an important reason why the Hidden Sect could still rally together
under different circumstances. No matter where they were, the personal
disciples could always meet through the Myriad Worlds Projection. Their relationship had always been maintained. Even if there were conflicts, the other disciples could mediate in the Myriad Worlds Projection. Han Jue continued cultivating after making
his choice.
The Chaos had been in a nervous state for the past twenty million years.
The Primordial Chaos and the Chaos had
already erupted with no less than ten
thousand wars. Han Huang’s strength attracted countless followers who were
Potential was a natural chasm that most cultivators could not cross. Cultivators of any cultivation level would have such questions.
The legend of the Primordial Pool made all living beings suspicious, but as someone succeeded, suspicion became madness. This matter gave the Great Dao Divine Spirits
a big headache.
Han Huang had never appeared. The various
factions did not dare to take the lead, afraid
shouted at Han Huang quietened down. Zhao Shuangquan seemed to be possessed and was still spreading the legend of the Dark Forbidden Lord, as if he did not know that Han Huang wanted to destroy the Chaos.
In short, all living beings in the Chaos felt that the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity was about to arrive!
Primordial Chaos.
The domain void was filled with vast purple
Qi as if it was really Primordial Chaos.
In a dark hall.
Han Huang was meditating. Dharmic powers
overflowed from his palms and constantly condensed into Primordial Demon Soldiers. These Primordial Demon Soldiers were like a dark version of the Divine Authority Generals. After successfully condensing, these Primordial Demon Soldiers retreated into the
darkness beside him and disappeared without
a trace.
A figure flew in.
It was Goddess Ming Ji.
She appeared in front of Han Huang and said,
her eyes filled with love, “Husband, you’ve been in seclusion for so long. You should rest.” Han Huang ignored her. Goddess Ming Ji continued, “I know that you
want to do something big, but we don’t have children yet. The Primordial Chaos doesn’t have any inheritors. This isn’t good.”
Han Huang suddenly stood up. His terrifying aura frightened Goddess Ming Ji away. She was so frightened that her face turned pale, and she looked at him in panic. Han Huang looked down at her and snorted.
“It’s already your greatest honor that I
married you. You still want to be pregnant with my child? Are you worthy?” Goddess Ming Ji felt extremely wronged and clenched her fists in her sleeves. “I’m not humiliating you. This is the truth. How many times have you been pregnant?
Don’t you know? A mortal like you can’t withstand the power of the Primordial Fiendcelestial. Give up early,” Han Huang said disdainfully. His blood-red eyes looked filled with hostility and killing intent.
Goddess Ming Ji gritted her teeth and said, “Then, do you plan to never have descendants?”
“I can use my own strength to create children when I create the Primordial Chaos. I don’t need you. Don’t disturb me in the future. I’ll
give you another piece of advice. Retreat as soon as possible and don’t try to control the situation. When the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity begins, you will be consigned to eternal damnation. It’s not worth it.” With that, Han Huang sat down again and
closed his eyes to create more Primordial Demon Soldiers.
Goddess Ming Ji curled her lips and thought to herself, “You clearly care about me, but
you’re always so fierce.”
She felt less aggrieved when she thought of Han Huang’s bad temper from the beginning. Although this fellow was fierce, he would always protect her when she was in danger. This meant that he still had her in his heart.
Who else could be the wife of the Primordial Fiendcelestial other than her? Goddess Ming Ji’s mood became wonderful again. She snorted softly and left. Han Huang opened his eyes and watched her leave, his eyes filled with coldness. “It’s not time yet. The supreme karma of this
Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity is too slow.
“
I can’t wait anymore… Han Huang thought silently and began to think about how to push for the calamity. He suddenly thought of someone and smiled.
His smile looked extremely evil and sinister in the dark hall.


In the dark void.
Bones and meteors were mixed together and covered this lifeless space, A bright sun shone at the end of the void, the only source of light. A dilapidated palace floated quietly. The stone statues in front of the hall were also very dilapidated. Some had lost their heads, and some had no arms. They looked strange and sinister.
Su Qi was in the hall, meditating quietly. The aura of misfortune surrounded his body. His expression changed as if black worms were crawling on his face.
Su Qi suddenly felt something and opened his eyes as a figure appeared in front of him.
It was Han Huang.
Han Huang cupped his fists and bowed to him. He smiled and said, “Senior Su, long time no see.”
Su Qi smiled. “Junior Huang, why are you here?”
He waved his right hand, and a mat appeared in front of him. Han Huang sat down.
The fellow disciples began to exchange pleasantries. They were not distant. They had met before, let alone the fact that they were fellow disciples.
After chatting for a while, Su Qi asked, “Why is Junior Huang looking for me?”
Han Huang smiled. “I’m prepared to destroy the Chaos and create the Primordial Chaos. Once I succeed, there will be no more restrictions. You can also create your own Great Dao World. Are you willing to help me?”
He went straight to the point and stared at him, waiting for his answer.
Su Qi was silent.
This was very important, so he naturally had to think about it.
Su Qi suddenly smiled. “Alright. Actually, I have the same intention.”
Han Huang smiled even more. The two of them did not need to say anything as they looked at each other.
Su Qi said, “Go back and prepare. I’ll find other fellow disciples on the eve of the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity. Just you and I are still far from enough to shake the Chaos.” Han Huang shrugged and left as a beam of light.
Su Qi’s gaze darkened as he thought, “Master, is this the true mission you gave me?
“Helping the Primordial Fiendcelestial is
quite interesting. Helping one’s own people is better than being used by others.”
…
A river filled with seven-colored light flowed
in a dazzling space. There was no direction and no living beings here. There was only this endless river that came from nowhere.
River of Destiny!
This was the River of Destiny, the core of the Chaos. It covered space, time, karma, and other rules. It also controlled the roots of the River of Destiny of the myriad worlds.
A figure suddenly stepped out from the depths of the river. He wore a white robe and a huge silver bird floated behind him, like a phoenix.
This person was Ji Xianshen.
Ji Xianshen’s expression was cold. He suddenly stopped and looked back when he
Destiny. The River of Destiny was
far-reaching and eternal.
“I’ll do what you need to do, but you can’t interfere in my matters,” Ji Xianshen said
calmly.
A sneer sounded, “You’re indeed strong enough now. What do you want to do?”
Ji Xianshen said, “The Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity will be led by my Junior Huang. This is the greatest variable in the Chaos. I naturally have to help him.” The mysterious voice snorted. “He will die.
“He would have died without me, but it’s different now.”
“Up to you. You can do something for me if
you push for the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity.”
Ji Xianshen turned around and left. He
vanished from the River of Destiny in the blink of an eye.
The River of Destiny fell silent again.
…
Ten million years later.
Han Jue obtained another Creation Heaven’s
Chosen.
He opened his eyes and frowned.
Su Qi seemed to have gone mad. He ran rampant in the Chaotic Void and unleashed his bad luck to the extreme. Even a Primordial
meeting.
Currently, Su Qi was not the only disciple who was prepared to help Han Huang. There were also Ji Xianshen, Dao Sovereign, Zhao Xuanyuan, Jiang Yi, Long Hao, Murong Qi, and Fang Liang.
The Primordial Chaos was powerful! “These brats. In that case, I have to speed
up.” Han Jue snorted in his heart. He prepared to
increase the expansion speed of the Ultimate Origin World. Previously, he was only afraid of attracting suspicion, but now, he didn’t
care.
The Purity Great Dao World no longer approached the Chaos ever since the Yin-Yang Purity Nirvana Deity became an Ultimate Origin Lifeform. Instead, it rushed towards the Ultimate Origin World.
This could be used by Han Jue. The Ultimate Origin World also stopped and
did not rush towards the Chaos. The Chaos could no longer devour the Ultimate Origin World. The Chaos might fly towards it instead when it became stronger.
Han Jue said, “From now on, you can curse as
much as you want. The target of the curse is Han Huang’s enemies.”
Shan’e opened his eyes and looked happy.
The Curse Origin Star did not involve karma.
The current Shan’e had already grown to the perfected Great Dao Supreme Realm. Even a Dao Creator could not deduce him. After all, he did not show karma in the Chaos. It was time to use him after he nurtured him for a hundred million years.
“Don’t worry, Progenitor. I won’t disappoint you!” Shan’e said excitedly.
Only Han Jue knew his ability. Even the Nine
Divine Stars didn’t know.
Han Jue ignored him.
As long as the Dao Creator did not attack, no
one could kill Han Huang.
In the past few years, the Myriad Worlds Projection had also been successfully upgraded and there was a new teleportation
function.
The disciples could teleport to the other disciples through the Myriad Worlds
Projection, provided that they had already joined. Han Jue looked at the Chaos.
Ji Xianshen, Dao Sovereign, and the others were leading the Primordial Demon Soldiers to destroy the Chaotic World and domains everywhere. They did not slaughter all living beings, but everything was destroyed everywhere they passed.
Han Huang was not the only one who wanted
to destroy the Chaos. There was also the Hidden Sect!
The Sect Master of the Hidden Sect was the
Divine Might Heavenly Sage. This made the various factions even more uneasy. However, the Primordial Chaos’ actions became greater and greater. The Chaos had no
choice but to counterattack, including the Nine Extremes Orthodoxy. Yu Yuan, who had already grown up, fought Ji
Xianshen with the power of the First Chaos.
What amused Han Jue was that Yu Yuan actually couldn’t defeat Ji Xianshen. It seemed that he had overestimated the first eight Chaotic Powers.
That made sense. Before those guys died, the strongest was only at the Great Dao Supreme Realm. At their peak, their strength might not
be as strong as a current Great Dao Supreme expert. Furthermore, Ji Xianshen was already at the perfected Great Dao Supreme Realm had the power of fate.
and
Han Jue discovered that there was a deeply hidden karma in Ji Xianshen’s body. The cultivation of the main body of this karma
was only a Great Dao Supreme, but this karma
A future Dao Creator! That person was now a Great Dao Supreme
and would be a Dao Creator in the future.
Han Jue found it strange. After reaching the cultivation level of the Dao Creator, one had already jumped out of the past and future. Even if there were Supreme Treasures that could involve the past of other Dao Creators, they would be discovered by the Dao Creator. Therefore, the Dao Creator usually wouldn’t involve space and time. That would only offend the other Dao Creators. Han Jue could see it even without the derivation function. The other Dao Creators could probably see it too.
However, this future Dao Creator had a special
identity. The other Dao Creators probably did
not dare to touch him easily. Han Jue laughed secretly. “You dare to
interfere with the past with your early-stage cultivation. Kid, you’ve underestimated the strength of the Dao Creators of this period. You’re even inferior to the Chaotic
Consciousness.”


Han Jue couldn’t be bothered by that future Dao Creator. It was a good opportunity to let this fellow stimulate the Great Dao
Immeasurable Calamity. If he forced the other Dao Creators to attack, it would also be a lesson for this fellow to not underestimate them.
It was very difficult to judge a Dao Creator’s strength unless they fought. After all, the Dao Creator would not die and was at the highest realm. Under such circumstances, anyone
Among them, Li Yao had even been to the Primordial Chaos and seemed to want to
participate in the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity.
Whatever.
Save one or a hundred.
In any case, Han Jue had already gathered their soul fragments. They could revive.
Han Jue watched for a while and then focused on cultivating.
The situation in the Chaos became more and more intense. Supreme karma was enveloping all living beings, causing their hostility to increase. The higher their cultivation level, the greater the impact.
Any conflict could be magnified under the supreme karma’s influence.
The Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity was about to erupt.
…
In the Primordial Pool.
Figures stood by and watched as countless cultivators lined up opposite the pool.
Cultivators jumped into the Primordial Pool one after another, less than ten breaths of time apart.
Ji Xianshen sighed. “Even I want to jump down.”
The Chaotic Heavenly Dog chuckled. “Jump. I think your potential is quite ordinary.”
Ji Xianshen glared at it.
Zhao Xuanyuan asked curiously, “Why isn’t Master Chicken here? It’s rare for the Hidden Sect to act together.”
against everyone.
After chatting with the Black Hell Chicken for a while, Jiang Yi asked, “Where’s Han Huang? When will he take action? Currently, there are already a trillion Demon Soldiers and more than a hundred million Primordial
Cultivators. He’ll definitely be able to overturn the Chaos with the Hidden Sect’s
support.”
Fang Liang raised his hand. There seemed to
be a wisp of green smoke in his hand, and he seemed to be playing with it. He chuckled and said, “The calamity has yet to arrive. You should be able to sense that karma power. Although it’s here, it’s not powerful enough. At least, it’s not enough to make us go mad.”
Everyone nodded in agreement.
It was indeed not enough.
At this moment, the Primordial Pool surged violently, startling the cultivators who were about to jump down.
The Primordial Pool was very big, even larger than the entire Immortal World. After the surface of the pool churned, it was extremely dangerous and terrifying.
Everyone looked over and saw a terrifying
giant shadow faintly discernible at the
bottom.
“What’s that?” Ji Xianshen asked.
Long Hao said excitedly, “It’s Primordial Despair. Han Huang told me before that other
than transforming Primordial lifeforms, the Primordial Pool’s also nurturing a killing
weapon.”
Primordial Despair?
stronger.
The cultivators who had witnessed Primordial
Despair were so frightened that they didn’t
dare to jump down anymore.
“What’s that?”
“Did all the cultivators who jumped down
feed this thing?”
alive.”
“What a terrifying killing intent. Even an ancient ferocious beast is far inferior.” “This ferocious beast can definitely harm the
Chaos!”
already prepared to be enemies with the
Chaos, so they were very excited after calming down.
The stronger the Primordial Chaos was, the
more it proved that their choice was correct.
Most cultivators came with the philosophy of promoting the Endless Era. Otherwise, it would be very difficult for the Primordial Chaos to have its current power. Although the living beings of the Chaos knew
about the Endless Era, they did not want to
die.
In addition, the Endless Era did not necessarily have to sacrifice the Chaos! The personal disciples of the Hidden Sect sighed at the Primordial Despair’s birth. Although Han Huang was arrogant, he did not
act recklessly. Instead, he was frantically accumulating strength. Just this Primordial
Despair was enough to make all the living
beings in the Chaos shiver. Time passed.
The cultivators continued to jump down after
the Primordial Despair calmed down. They were pleasantly surprised to discover that the Primordial Despair was only hiding at the bottom of the Primordial Pool and did not
hurt them. They were even more relieved.
Han Jue was immersed in cultivation and couldn’t extricate himself.
When the Chaos was about to encounter the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity, the Ultimate Origin World also stirred up the Ultimate Origin Immeasurable Calamity and swept through the entire Great Dao World. It
looked like the Ultimate Origin World was in chaos, but to the three supreme factions, it was still under control.
The chaotic battle of all living beings would
Not only did the calamity reshuffle the various levels of the Ultimate Origin World, but it also constantly found the right path in
the chaos. It used providence to nurture the rules and used the rules to help create creation. Because of this, the Ultimate Origin World kept flying.
After a certain period of time.
A roar woke Han Jue up.
“I am the Primordial Fiendcelestial, Han
Huang. From today onwards, I will announce
to the Chaos, Transcendent, Consciousnessless, and Shi Tian that the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity has arrived. I will use the Conquest Spear to destroy the Chaos and create an Endless Era.
You can also make your last futile struggle for the meaning of your existence! “Primordial Chaos, listen up. With the
Primordial Chaos as the center, we will fight in the Chaos. If we encounter life, we will kill. If we encounter souls, we will slaughter them all. We swear to die!”
Han Huang’s voice resounded throughout the Chaos, echoing for a long time. Even Han Jue’s Dao Field echoed with his
voice.
How strange. This kid’s Primordial World was
not strong, and it was even chaotic, but his
strength was increasing.
Could this be the supreme karma of the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity?
Interesting.
Han Jue checked his attributes panel. He was
already 430 million years old, which meant
that he had been in seclusion for more than 20 million years. He started checking his emails.
Shan’e said excitedly after seeing that he opened his eyes, “Progenitor, Ancestor Han Huang is too domineering. Even I want to fight for him. So far, few enemies dare to attack Ancestor Han Huang. I can’t even find a target to curse!”
Han Jue ignored him.
“By the way, Ancestor Han Ling also wants to
deal with him. Do I need to curse her?”
Han Jue glanced at him. Shan’e shivered in fear and smiled
awkwardly. “I understand, I understand…” What nonsense!
How can you curse my precious daughter?
Han Jue didn’t say anything and continued to check his emails.
Shan’e didn’t dare to disturb him anymore.
He continued to look at the Chaos and
trembled in excitement. With Han Huang’s declaration of war, the
Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity officially
arrived!
The Great Dao Supremes of both sides were the first to collide in the space above the three thousand Great Dao. Ji Xianshen, Dao Sovereign, and the others all participated. Nearly a hundred Great Dao Supremes fought chaotically, causing the three thousand Great
Dao to tremble.
