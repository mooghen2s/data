 “Father, what is this?” Han Qing’er asked nervously. This was the first time she had encountered such a situation. She was extremely nervous.
 Han Jue said, “Go out and wait.”
 With that, he stepped into the black vortex and activated the Supreme Treasure on his body.
 When that hand appeared just now, Han Jue had already seen the other party’s cultivation.
 Late-stage Great Dao Primordial Chaos Realm!
 Han Jue focused his attention to prevent the other party from entering the third Dao Field from the black vortex.
 He stepped out of the black vortex and saw a dilapidated void. Lightning interwove, and a majestic stone tablet appeared in front of him. It was covered in caves, and terrifying things surged in them.
 The Five Great Divine Punishers were tied to the top of the stone tablet by chains and could not move.
 Han Jue immediately used the simulation trial to check his surroundings.
  (Ancestor Shen Yin: Perfected Great Dao Primordial Chaos Realm, Chaotic Lifeform, Transcendent Dao Expert, Body of Darkness]
 There was no stronger existence!
 That meant that Han Jue didn’t sense anything wrong.
 Han Jue’s gaze landed on the top of the stone tablet. A figure stood there. He wore a black robe and his hair was disheveled. His skin was dry like tree bark and his face was cold, like a demon that had crawled out of the netherworld.
 At this moment, Ancestor Shen Yin’s right arm was slowly recovering. The hand that was destroyed by Han Jue was his hand.
 Ancestor Shen Yin stared at him in shock and asked in a low voice, “Who are you?”
 He glanced at Han Tuo below. He didn’t expect Han Tuo to have such a background.
 Yi Tian roared excitedly. “Godfather! Save us!”
 Godfather?
 The other three Divine Punishers were shocked. The legendary Divine Might Heavenly Sage!
 Han Jue activated all his Supreme Treasures, and the divine light was oppressive. In their opinion, his aura was even stronger and more stunning than the Ultimate God of Punishment.
 This scene shocked them.
 Han Jue said, “Why did you capture my son?”
 Ancestor Shen Yin frowned and asked, “Who’s your son? Tell me, I can let him go.”
 Han Jue could tell at a glance that these five were the Five Great Divine Punishers. He was on good terms with the Ultimate God of Punishment and these people were all good friends of Han Tuo. He naturally had to save them.
 “Let them all go. Treat it as a misunderstanding,” Han Jue said seriously. He left a trace of his will in the black vortex to prevent anyone from sneaking in.
 Ancestor Shen Yin laughed as if he had heard the funniest joke.
 He suddenly stared at him and said coldly, “Don’t you find it ridiculous?”
 Han Jue sighed and asked, “Did they offend you?”
 “No.”
 “Then, what do you want?” “I naturally want their bodies.”
 Ancestor Shen Yin raised his hands, and a strange black aura emitted from the countless holes in the stone tablet.
 At this moment, he discovered that Han Jue was gone.
 He did not panic. Instead, the corners of his mouth curled up.
 Han Jue appeared behind him and slashed with the Primordial Judgment Sword.
 Black Qi appeared out of thin air and wrapped around Ancestor Shen Yin’s body.
 The Primordial Judgment Sword slashed down and the black aura dissipated. Ancestor Shen Yin’s body was slashed into two.
 “How can this be?!”
 Ancestor Shen Yin’s expression changed drastically in disbelief.
 At this moment, a powerful imprisonment power suppressed him, preventing him from moving. Even his soul could not escape.
 He was shocked to find that he could not mobilize the power of the Great Dao.
 Impossible!
 He was a perfected Great Dao Sage!
 He was already a top-notch cultivator in the entire Chaos. Who was his match other than those ancient Divine Spirits?
 A Fiendcelestial Dharma idol suddenly rose above Han Jue’s head and grabbed him with one hand, crushing him.
 (Ancestor Shen Yin has developed hatred towards you. Current Hatred Points: 6 stars]
 Han Jue sensed his surroundings and didn’t see Ancestor Shen Yin anymore.
 He had indeed crushed Ancestor Shen Yin to death just now.
 In other words, this fellow had a life-saving method elsewhere.
 He clicked his tongue in wonder. How dare they be so arrogant with such strength?
  He thought that Ancestor Shen Yin had some special method, but he couldn’t withstand a single blow.
 Han Jue waved his sleeve and shattered the chains that locked the five Divine Punishers.
 He raised his hand and put the huge stone tablet into his sleeve, using his Dharmic powers to suppress it.
 He could sense that the stone tablet contained countless living beings. It should be a race, but this race was very strange and did not have any life.
 Yi Tian heaved a sigh of relief. The other three Divine Punishers looked at Han Jue in reverence.
 Han Jue said, “It’s nothing. Leave as soon as possible.”
 With that, he vanished.
 The distant black vortex shrank.
 A Divine Punisher looked at Han Tuo and sighed. “Boss, your father is really powerful. It’s too easy.”
 Ancestor Shen Yin, who brought them despair just now, was helpless in front of Han Jue. It broadened his horizons.
 “Yes! As expected of the Divine Might Heavenly Sage!”
 “It’s said that the leader of the Divine Spirits and the Divine Might Heavenly Sage are joining forces to hold the Chaotic Assembly. Doesn’t that mean that they are equals?”
 “This strength should indeed be equal. He can be the strongest in the Chaos.”
 “Unfortunately, Godfather left too quickly. He hasn’t acknowledged me yet.”
 Han Tuo sighed. “Actually, I didn’t want to invite him. We have to be careful in the future. We were still careless previously and fell into that old fellow’s trap. We actually hunted him for ten thousand years. It’s ridiculous.”
 The other four Divine Punisher cultivators also looked embarrassed.
 Yi Tian coughed. Back then, he was the one who said that he wanted to chase after him when he saw Ancestor Shen Yin escape. They chased for ten thousand years.
 Thinking back, it was indeed very silly.
 “This place is not simple. Should we investigate?” a Divine Punisher asked.
 Han Tuo scanned the surroundings and said, “Let’s leave first and tell this to the leader of the Divine Spirits.”
 The four Divine Punisher experts had no objections and quickly left with him.
 Inside the Daoist temple.
 Han Jue sat down and the black vortex disappeared.
 Han Qing’er came over and asked, “So fast? What happened just now?”
 She was hesitating if she should listen to her father and go out when he returned so quickly.
 How long had it been?
 Han Jue said, “Your brother asked for help, so I went to help him.”
 Han Qing’er blinked and asked, “It’s settled?”
 “Mm.”
 “Did brother encounter an enemy or is he
 trapped?”
 “Both.”
 “What about the enemy?”
 “He’s dead for the time being.”
 “What do you mean for the time being?”
 “I killed him, but he had a way to revive.”
 Han Qing’er was secretly shocked. He could be revived?
 It seemed that she had to be careful when facing enemies in the future.
 How could she confirm that the other party was really dead?
  Han Jue said, “Go out and cultivate. Try to attain the Dao as soon as possible.”
 Han Qing’er nodded and couldn’t help but ask, “Then, what’s the enemy’s cultivation level? Freedom Sage? Or stronger?”
 In her opinion, the enemy who could trap her brother was definitely a Freedom Sage. It was impossible for him to be weaker.
 “Stronger,” Han Jue said. Han Qing’er frowned and left.
 Han Jue was surprised. Why did this girl change her attitude?
 Shouldn’t she be shocked?
 Sigh.
 His daughter was older and not as cute as when she was young.
 Han Jue shook his head and laughed.
 He took out the huge stone tablet after Han Qing’er left.


 Han Jue stared at the stone tablet in his palm. The stone tablet became small under the Supreme Power’s control. The dense holes were like countless black spots. It was very strange.
 His Sage Sense penetrated the stone tablet. The living beings in the stone tablet were like black worms. Their bodies were surrounded by black mist and looked like ghosts.
 These living beings did not have intelligence. They surged like ants. The largest of them should be the broodmother, constantly laying eggs.
 “Eh?”
 Han Jue suddenly exclaimed in surprise. He discovered that the black aura on these black worms could actually devour his Sage Sense. Although this amount couldn’t affect him, it was a fact that it had the ability.
 He was a Great Dao Supreme!
 Who could stop it if the Sage Sense of the Great Dao could be devoured?
 Most importantly, these black worms were still young and had yet to mature.
 He shivered.
  How terrifying would these black worms’ power be if Ancestor Shen Yin nurtured them to a mature state?
 That was not right. Why would Ancestor Shen Yin bring this tablet to show off if they were so powerful?
 Han Jue asked in his mind, “I want to know the origins of this worm.”
 ......
 (1 trillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 So expensive!
 It was already equivalent to the value of the leader of the Divine Spirits.
 Han Jue immediately chose to continue.
 [Turbid Yin World Destruction Worm: Born at the beginning of the Chaos. It was born from the Primordial Chaos’s remnant will when the Seven Supreme Rules suppressed the Primordial Chaos. It can devour magic power and senses. It will never grow up and can only be imprisoned in the stone tablet without the Primordial Qi.)
 So impressive?
 Devour magic power and senses!
 It needed nebulous Primordial Qi to be nourished. No wonder Ancestor Shen Yin dared to bring them along. The Turbid Yin World Destruction Worms might not be highly regarded by Ancestor Shen Yin, but this tablet was equivalent to a Chaotic Supreme Treasure. Its surface was tightly sealed.
 A Chaotic Supreme Treasure was equivalent to a Great Dao Supreme Treasure. It was a Supreme Treasure that even a Great Dao Supreme wanted.
 Above that was the Ultimate Dao Treasure. It was a legendary treasure that all living beings in the Chaos did not know of.
 Han Jue returned to the main Dao Field and placed the stone tablet in the Primordial Heavenly Prison. It was invisible and formless, but it was fixed here and needed him to activate it personally.
 He wanted to use the Primordial Heavenly Prison to enslave the Turbid Yin World Destruction Worm. He didn’t know if it was feasible.
 Han Jue left a wisp of will to monitor and then returned to the third Dao Field.
 He directly sent a dream to Ancestor Shen Yin and met him with his true body.
 In the dream.
 Ancestor Shen Yin opened his eyes. His expression instantly darkened when he saw Han Jue.
 Although he was terrified, he could sense that this was a dream.
 Why should he be afraid, then?
 “You took my treasure. This karma has been formed!” Ancestor Shen Yin said coldly.
 Han Jue asked curiously, “Do you not understand the current Chaos? Do you know who you caught?”
 Ancestor Shen Yin said coldly, “Isn’t he your son?”
 “No, they’re the Five Great Divine Punishers appointed by the leader of the Divine Spirits to supervise the Great Dao Divine Spirits. Your sins are grave. The leader of the Divine Spirits will not let you go,” Han Jue said casually. He found it strange. This fellow was a top existence among the Great Dao Sages. Why was he so rash as if he didn’t know anything about the Chaos?
 Ancestor Shen Yin frowned. “Who is the leader of the Divine Spirits?”
 “I…”
 Ancestor Shen Yin hesitated. He wasn’t stupid. Perhaps the Chaos had already been overturned.
 Han Jue’s methods were already extraordinary. How strong was the leader of the Divine Spirits that he spoke of?
 Han Jue asked, “Where are you from? Tell
 me.”
 Ancestor Shen Yin sneered in his heart upon seeing that Han Jue was not arrogant. It seemed that this fellow only had cultivation, but he was only a lackey of the leader of the Divine Spirits. He had no guts.
 Ancestor Shen Yin snorted. “I’ve been suppressed at the bottom of the Chaos for countless years. I just fought my way out not long ago.”
 The bottom of the Chaos again?
 Then, did this fellow know the Ultimate God of Punishment?
 Han Jue wanted to ask, but he decided not to after thinking about it.
 Karma would form once Ancestor Shen Yin said that he knew the Ultimate God of Punishment. The Ultimate God would naturally know.
 It was best to kill him directly. Six-star Hatred Points was not so easy to resolve!
 Ancestor Shen Yin sneered upon seeing that he was silent. “Hurry up and return my treasure!”
 Han Jue took out the Primordial Judgment Sword and used the Dark Falling Prison to turn the dream of the Dark Nightmare into reality, pulling Ancestor Shen Yin’s body into the dream.
 In an instant, Ancestor Shen Yin seemed to sense something and his expression changed drastically.
 Han Jue waved his sword and attacked with all his might. He didn’t even need to use the Dharma Idol Fusion Technique. His own Supreme Power was enough to kill the other party. Ancestor Shen Yin was shocked. Sword Qi flashed and killed him before he could resist.
 The dream shattered!
 Han Jue’s will returned to reality.
 He opened his eyes and checked his interpersonal relationships.
 Ancestor Shen Yin’s portrait was no longer there. He was beyond dead.
 There were no surprises.
 Han Jue wasn’t an ordinary Great Dao Supreme. He could kill 25,000 Foolish Sword Sages with his full strength. Ancestor Shen Yin had not reached the Great Dao Supreme Realm.
 “The bottom of the Chaos…” Han Jue muttered to himself curiously.
 Then, he continued cultivating.
 The mid-stage of the Great Dao Supreme Realm was not enough.
 The Dao Creator Realm was his small goal. The Creator Lord Realm was his long-term goal. Surpassing the Creator Lord Realm was his ultimate goal.
 Circular stone platforms floated in the blue sky and white clouds.
 The five Divine Punishers stood in front of the Ultimate God of Punishment on the highest stone platform.
 The Ultimate God of Punishment sat on a crystal throne. Blood Qi surged in the crystal, looking rather sinister.
 The Ultimate God of Punishment’s right index finger tapped the armrest thoughtfully.
 Yi Tian was impatient and couldn’t help but ask, “Exalted God, that fellow’s background is unknown. Such an expert appeared in the Chaos and is still capturing Chaotic Fiendcelestials. Could it be that Life’s forces are running rampant again?”
 He was furious upon thinking of Ancestor Shen Yin.
 It had been a long time since he felt so aggrieved!
 The Ultimate God of Punishment slowly said, “His name is Ancestor Shen Yin. He’s from the bottom of the Chaos. Han Tuo, Yi Tian, haven’t you been to the bottom of the Chaos? You know how terrifying it is.”
 Han Tuo and Yi Tian’s expressions changed drastically.
  Back then, it was a nightmare when they were suppressed at the bottom of the Chaos by the Primordial Ancestor God. Although they survived, they were still cautious. At that time, there was a terrifying aura in all directions. They still trembled in fear even
 now.
 The Ultimate God of Punishment said, “Since the Divine Might Heavenly Sage has already taken action, I believe Ancestor Shen Yin can’t live. This matter will end here. You’re not allowed to step into the lowest level of the Chaos before the Chaos is strong enough.”
 He had fought his way out from the bottom of the Chaos and knew how terrifying that place was.
 He changed the topic and said, “I’ll give you another mission now.”
 Han Tuo said, “Go ahead.”
 The Ultimate God of Punishment narrowed his eyes and said, “I want you to investigate the Ancient Desolate and send back what you see and hear.”
 Yi Tian asked in surprise, “Can’t you deduce it?”
 Han Tuo and the other three Divine Punishers glared at him.
 The Ultimate God of Punishment chuckled. “That Pangu severed the rules of karma. Most of the Chaos can’t even be considered a place, let alone the Ancient Desolate. I’m not going personally because I have something to consider.”Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎


 The five Divine Punishers looked at each other when the Ultimate God mentioned Pangu.
 Pangu had already died several times. Unknowingly, he was no longer that powerful in the hearts of the living beings in the Chaos.
 However, they did not expect Pangu to be able to sever karma, preventing even an existence like the leader of the Divine Spirits from spying on the Chaos.
 What a terrifying Pangu!
 “Alright, you can leave.”
 The Ultimate God of Punishment waved his hand. The five Divine Punishers bowed and quickly left.
 The world fell silent.
 The Ultimate God of Punishment meditated and cultivated. As he began to cultivate, a wisp of black aura appeared between his brows, making his face look very strange.
 Ancestor Shen Yin’s death did not cause a stir in the Chaos because he was unknown.
 All the worlds hidden in the past appeared and began to recruit geniuses to fight for domains, resources, and providence.
 The most lively was the Chaotic Domain where the Heavenly Dao was located. The Heavenly Dao was the first world with perfect rules. Before this, the world was only tangible, but there was nothing special. The Heavenly Dao’s uniqueness made the worlds near it very prosperous.
 ......
 Tens of thousands of Daoists meditated in a grand palace in the Three Pure Sacred World. They faced a direction, and two Daoists with extraordinary auras faced them.
 One was the Heavenly Lord of Primordial Beginning, and the other was the Heavenly Sect Master.
 The Heavenly Lord of Primordial Beginning had an Immortal Dao Bone and a sharp gaze. The Heavenly Sect Master wore a black robe and looked like a youth, but his body emitted a murderous aura that made people not dare to look at him.
 The Heavenly Lord of Primordial Beginning slowly said, “We can’t fight with the Heavenly Dao head-on. After all, the Heavenly Dao is our home. However, our unfilial disciple betrayed us and controlled the power of the Heavenly Dao himself. He offended his superior. I’ve decided to defeat the Heavenly Dao in the Chaotic Assembly and defeat the Heavenly Dao in terms of reputation before devouring it.”
 The Daoists in the hall discussed.
 “The Chaotic Assembly is a gathering of geniuses. It’s indeed important.”
 “Although the Heavenly Dao’s foundation is strong, it has been suppressed for too long. In terms of the Heavenly Dao, there aren’t many Primordial Chaos Zenith Heaven Golden Immortals.”
 “However, we can’t avoid the Divine Might Heavenly Sage if we want to touch the Heavenly Dao.” “The Divine Might Heavenly Sage is powerful, but our Grand Pure Sage is not bad either.”
 The name of the Divine Might Heavenly Sage was indeed thunderous, but they had never seen the power of a Divine Authority General, much less the Divine Might Heavenly Sage. The Heavenly Sect Master snorted. “Divine Might Heavenly Sage. I want to see him.”
 The Heavenly Lord of Primordial Beginning smiled and said, “Junior, you can’t speak nonsense. The Divine Might Heavenly Sage is indeed powerful. Besides, the Heavenly Dao and the Three Pure Sacred World will fuse together sooner or later. How can we be enemies?”
 The Heavenly Sect Master glanced at him with disdain, but he did not reply.
 At this moment…
 An inappropriate voice sounded.
 “What’s there to fight for? Do we still need to care about the Heavenly Dao if we obtain the peak of the Chaos?”
 Everyone turned around. The person who spoke was a white-robed Daoist. He had a fair face and was very young. He looked to be only sixteen or seventeen years old.
 He stood up slowly with an arrogant expression and looked down on all the Daoists present.
 The Heavenly Lord of Primordial Beginning chuckled. “Jiang Gongming, do you think it’s so easy to fight for the top of the world? There’s so much chaos that even we don’t know how big the Three Pure Ones are. There’s no limit to the number of geniuses.”
 Jiang Gongming smiled. “I attained the Dao at a million years old and attained Freedom at ten million years old. I attained the Great Dao at 50 million years old. I will definitely dominate the Chaotic Assembly. Teacher, tell me, is there really someone in the Chaos who has a higher potential than me? I’ve never gone out on an adventure and I have never experienced enlightenment. I’ve cultivated on my own.”
  Those Daoists who didn’t know Jiang Gongming were in an uproar.
 Great Dao Sage!
 The Heavenly Lord of Primordial Beginning shook his head. “You’re indeed talented, but you lack experience. Many geniuses have appeared in the Heavenly Dao recently. For example, the three disciples of the Divine Might Heavenly Sage are already at the Freedom Realm before they reached ten million years old. Although they are affected by opportunities, their cultivation realms are true.”
 Jiang Gongming frowned and asked in a low voice, “Who are those three?”
 “Dao Sovereign, Zhao Xuanyuan, and Jiang Yi are currently cultivating with the Grand Pure Sage’s clone.”
 Jiang Gongming frowned even more.
 Jiang Gongming nodded unhappily.
 The other Daoists also began to discuss Dao Sovereign and the other two. This made Jiang Gongming even more unhappy.
 The Heavenly Sect Master stared at Jiang Gongming and smiled. It was unknown what he was thinking.
 Third Dao Field.
 The expansion of the Primordial World still showed no limit so far. The stars in the Primordial World doubled in number after breaking through, as many as the lifespan of the origin.
 The Turbid Yin World Destruction Worm was still in the Primordial Heavenly Prison. It would probably take some time. After all, it was worth a trillion years of lifespan.
 Han Jue habitually checked his emails and checked his recent friends.
 Some were beaten, some obtained opportunities, and new maps were unlocked.
 Han Jue discovered that more and more names of the world appeared in the emails ever since the Ultimate God of Punishment took over.
 This fellow was really wise from the looks of
 it.
 However, was the stronger the Chaos, the better it was for him, a Primordial Fiendcelestial?
 Would the Chaos discover his son’s bloodline in the future and besiege him even if he surpassed the Primordial Fiendcelestial and his son inherited his bloodline?
 Han Jue decided to deduce.
 “I want to know the future of Xing Hongxuan’s son. Yes, let’s deduce how he dies.”
 Han Jue thought silently. Calculating the time of death was the most direct. It would be a good thing if he couldn’t deduce it.
 (10 trillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 ‘Eh?’
  Would he really die one day?
 Han Jue frowned and immediately chose to continue.
 He entered the illusion.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and discovered that he was standing in a palace covered in bones. There were bones of all kinds of races, like purgatory. It was ghastly and terrifying.
 He saw that the palace was vast. At a glance, there was a huge throne that was ten thousand feet tall a million miles away. It was coiled with dragon bones and looked like it was cast from iron. It flickered with a cold
 light.
 “This is my son?”
 Han Jue narrowed his eyes and sized up the ten-thousand-foot-tall figure.
 This child was actually wearing his Time Dao Robe. His black hair was tied up under a golden pearl crown. He had a handsome face and his eyes were blood-red. He was like an emperor who ruled all living beings as he looked forward lazily and stared indifferently in Han Jue’s direction.


 This was the first time Han Jue saw his son’s appearance clearly. He indeed looked like him. He was more handsome than Han Tuo, but he also had a hint of evilness.
 This kid had a strong killing intent!
 Han Jue turned around and saw a burly figure walking over with a strong light on his back.
 His expression became strange after he looked carefully.
 It was the Ultimate God of Punishment.
 Figures appeared behind the Ultimate God. Among them were Five Great Divine Punishers and dozens of Great Dao Divine Spirits.
 They walked past Han Jue and stared at the ten-thousand-foot-tall figure in front of them.
 Han Jue noticed that the Great Dao Divine Spirits were all very nervous and they were trembling. Han Tuo clenched his fists and his face was pale, as if he was suffering in his heart.
 “Primordial Fiendcelestial, you will die here today. Do you have anything to say before you
  die?”
 The entire sky above the palace was covered in dark clouds and thunder rumbled.
 The ten-thousand-foot-tall figure looked down at the Great Dao Divine Spirits in front of him and smiled disdainfully. “My good brother, are you also going to kill me?”
 Han Tuo’s expression turned even uglier.
 Yi Tian cursed. “You brat, you’ve done all sorts of evil. Your brother can tell right from wrong and won’t help you. Instead of blaming him, you should blame yourself for your monstrous evil!”
 “Hahahaha”
 The ten-thousand-foot-tall figure laughed sinisterly.
 “Who decides what’s evil? All of you?
 “I slaughtered a Chaotic Domain, but that domain is only a place where cultivators gather. Those cultivators all have negative karma. Besides, have you never killed living beings by mistake? Have you not killed many?”
 The Great Dao Divine Spirits were silent.
 The Ultimate God of Punishment said indifferently, “We’ll let bygones be bygones once the rules are set. We all have to follow the rules. Times have changed, understand? Besides, is this matter as simple as the slaughtering of a Chaotic Domain? You trampled on the Supreme Rules and caused chaos in the lives of all living beings. You stepped into the Chaotic River of Destiny and severed the past of countless cultivators, causing their Dao hearts to be in chaos. Do you have more sins that you need me to explain?
 “You must die today.”
 The ten-thousand-foot-tall figure stood up and said disdainfully, “You want to kill me? You think too highly of yourselves. Ultimate God of Punishment, do you really think you’re already the strongest in the Chaos?”
 The Ultimate God of Punishment was moved.
 The ten-thousand-foot-tall figure laughed. “There are still realms above the Great Dao. That’s a realm that even you and Laozi can’t enter. As the creator of his Dao, my father has long stepped into the Dao Creator Realm, and so have I!
 “Today, you will witness the power of the Dao Creator!”
 Boom
 A terrifying aura erupted and the entire palace instantly turned into dust. The Ultimate God of Punishment raised his hand to block, but the Great Dao Divine Spirits behind him were destroyed one after another, leaving only Han Tuo. Han Tuo forcefully blocked, but his body couldn’t withstand it and he was bathed in blood.
 The ten-thousand-foot-tall figure rose. His entire body shone with a strong light. He looked down at the Ultimate God of Punishment and raised his right hand, his palm facing him.
 The Ultimate God of Punishment’s expression changed drastically. He discovered that he could not move.
 “Ultimate God of Punishment, I respect you for your contributions to the Chaos, so I didn’t kill you. However, you overestimate yourself and actually dared to rally the Divine Spirits to attack. You’re really courting death!”
 The ten-thousand-foot-tall figure said coldly, his tone filled with killing intent.
 Han Jue was secretly shocked.
 His son was a Dao Creator?
 His aura was indeed terrifying!
 “Hmph!”
 A cold snort suddenly sounded. The aura of the ten-thousand-foot-tall figure was immediately extinguished. Everything around him stopped moving. Even space stopped twisting violently.
 The ten-thousand-foot-tall figure’s expression changed drastically. “Who?”
 “Primordial Fiendcelestial, you want to overturn the Chaos. Your sins should be consigned to eternal damnation. Your body and soul will be destroyed. Your cultivation will be reduced to nothingness!”
 An indifferent voice sounded. Everything in front of Han Jue shattered like a mirror as soon as he finished speaking. He saw the ten-thousand-foot-tall figure shatter into countless small pieces and turn into dust.
 The illusion shattered.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and frowned.
 The last to attack should be the Chaotic Consciousness, the Formless Transcendent Deity, or the Ninth Chaos.
 No matter who it was, they were undoubtedly Dao Creators.
 Of course, there was probably something else. Han Jue couldn’t blindly trust everything he
 saw.
 One thing was certain.
 His youngest son was still reckless.
 A half-step Dao Creator dared to act recklessly.
 Han Jue directly skipped the possibility of the father and son falling out. He chose to believe the most dangerous possibility, which was that he had lost and was suppressed by the other Dao Creators.
 He immediately felt a sense of danger.
 He still had to cultivate diligently.
 Han Jue took a deep breath.
 In addition, he had to educate his youngest son well and tell him not to be reckless after he was born.
 Han Jue wouldn’t deny his son because of the future, because that was only a fate in the present. It had never happened and he could still change it.
 Then, he continued cultivating.
 Time quickly passed. Forty thousand years later.
 [Turbid Yin World Destruction Worm successfully enslaved]
 [The Turbid Yin World Destruction Worm has a favorable impression of you. Current favorability: Max.)
 Han Jue opened his eyes and teleported to the main Dao Field.
 This mother worm was probably the will of the Turbid Yin World Destruction Worm.
 Then, Han Jue began to refine the Connate restriction contained in the stone tablet. He used a hundred years to refine it into his Dharma treasure.
 He threw the entire stone tablet into the Primordial World and drew the Primordial Qi into it to nourish the Turbid Yin World Destruction Worm.
 Then, he teleported to the third Dao Field and continued cultivating.
  Han Jue was still looking forward to the Turbid Yin World Destruction Worm.
 The terrifying Insect Race that devoured Dharmic powers and thoughts was definitely a cultivator’s nightmare. They were even more terrifying than the Inauspicious Evil.
 In the pure white space, there were no other colors other than white. At a glance, there was no end to it.
 A huge head floated quietly in one corner of this space. Many stiff corpses as tiny as sand could be seen around it.
 He suddenly opened his nine eyes. His gaze was extremely cold and emotionless. The aura of time flowed out, heavy and lonely.
 “Who is spying on me and creating my fate?”
 The huge head muttered to itself, “I can’t deduce the Chaos. Could it be that Pangu didn’t sever the supreme karma just to resist the Divine Authority Generals?
 “Interesting. There are still variables in the Chaos. I want to see who can rise.
 “I’ll make this Chaos more interesting since I’m going to change.” With that said, the eye between his eyebrows suddenly burst out and quickly disappeared into the distance.


 In the depths of the Chaos.
 Two groups of cultivators were at odds on a dilapidated continent.
 On one side were Ancestor Xitian, Li Daokong, Shi Dudao, and the others. On the other side were Huang Zuntian and the others.
 Huang Zuntian had even more subordinates than Ancestor Xitian.
 Huang Zuntian stared at him and said, “Ancestor, you should join Life on account of our friendship with the Heavenly Dao. I’m the orthodox lineage of Life Lord and have a million Calamity Life Controllers under me. You can’t lead these subordinates alone.”
 Shi Dudao and Li Daokong frowned.
 Ancestor Xitian smiled and said, “Huang Zuntian, I didn’t expect the Heavenly Dao to have someone like you. Your talent isn’t in cultivation, but your potential is the same as that Divine Might Heavenly Sage. It’s immeasurable.”
 Huang Zuntian chuckled. “Thank you for your praise, ancestor. Now, I only want to gather the Calamity Life Controllers and look forward to the future together. Although the Chaos is peaceful, we can’t escape our fate. We will be defeated one by one sooner or later if we don’t unite. We were actually no longer Chaotic lifeforms when we became Calamity Life Controllers. We have to restrain ourselves and unite if we want to survive in the Chaos.”
  Ancestor Xitian nodded as if he agreed with Huang Zuntian, but he did not agree to the merger.
 The atmosphere became solemn and silent.
 Shi Dudao thought to himself, “What’s going on? Why hasn’t the Dark Forbidden Lord appeared? What’s he doing?”
 He suddenly couldn’t see through it.
 He thought that the Dark Forbidden Lord and the Divine Might Heavenly Sage were the same person. The Dark Forbidden Lord first supported Life and helped the Divine Might Heavenly Sage increase his reputation. Now that the Divine Might Heavenly Sage was already famous in the Chaos, it was time to clean up the mess and unite the Life faction to develop into a potential force hidden in the dark.
 “Ancestor, have you thought it through?” Huang Zuntian narrowed his eyes and asked. His right hand behind his waist secretly gestured.
 This was the signal to prepare for battle.
 Ancestor Xitian took a step forward and smiled. “We can submit, but shouldn’t you prove your strength as the Life Lord? Upper-level methods can’t convince the masses. You still have to rely on Mystical Powers if you want to lead the Life faction to prosperity.”
 Huang Zuntian smiled and said, “Then please enlighten me, ancestor.”
 His eyes emitted a cold light.
 Ancestor Xitian suddenly sensed danger.
 For some reason, he thought of Han Jue’s Heaven Earth Mystic Yellow World Piercing Sword Finger.
 This kid was indeed not simple!
 Time passed.
 A hundred thousand years passed.
 Han Qing’er was still meditating and cultivating under the old tree. Now, her cultivation level had already reached the Primordial Chaos Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm. She had attained the Dao in hundreds of thousands of years. This breakthrough speed was already exaggerated.
 Qingluan’er had just finished cultivating and was stretching. She glanced at her daughter and couldn’t help but ask, “Qing’er, aren’t you tired?”
 In any case, Qingluan’er couldn’t continue cultivating. She would stop to rest every once in a while.
 Qingluan’er blinked and was stunned for a moment before understanding.
 She was mocking her cultivation talent.
 Qingluan’er slapped Han Qing’er’s back, but
 e did not use much strength, afraid that it would affect her cultivation.
 She sighed as she looked at Han Qing’er’s side profile.
 Be it sons or daughters, they all yearned to cultivate.
 She didn’t understand it in the past, but now she did, because it was passed down from their father.
 Han Jue’s cultivation was even more exaggerated. He had been in seclusion for millions of years. Her scalp would tingle every time she thought of it.
 Footsteps sounded at this moment.
 Han Jue walked over.
 Qingluan’er stood up in surprise upon seeing him.
 “Husband, why are you here?”
 Han Qing’er also opened her eyes. She stood up and moved in front of him. “Father, I want to spar with you!”
 The living beings not far away also opened their eyes. They only looked a few years older after so many years.
 Han Jue smiled and said, “I came out to see
 you.”
 He glanced at Han Qing’er and said, “You’re not qualified to spar with me.”
 Han Qing’er was not convinced.
 “Impossible! I’m very strong now. Those disciples are not my match!”
 “So, only you can fight me.”
 “How about this, I’ll let Jiang Jueshi fight you.”
 “No.” Han Qing’er rejected firmly.
 Han Qing’er said dad next chapter will be a fake and will be replaced with real chapter after few hours so don’t panic.
 She wasn’t stupid. Jiang Jueshi was a Freedom Sage. The terrifying feeling he gave her back then was still vivid in her mind.
 Moreover, Jiang Jueshi was only a disciple. He wouldn’t hold back against her.
 However, it was impossible for her father to hurt her.
 Han Jue smiled and used the Dark Nightmare to pull Han Qing’er into the dream.
 The dream was the Chaotic Void.
 Han Qing’er looked around in surprise. She thought that her father had brought her to the void and did not realize that this was only a dream.
 Fiendcelestial Dharma Idols condensed above his head. Every one of them was a million feet tall. There were a hundred of them. All of them leaned forward and looked down at Han Qing’er.
 Han Qing’er was dumbfounded. She had never seen such a scene. She looked up and saw that she was surrounded.
 She trembled in fear.
 Ant!
 She suddenly thought of this word.
 Back when she was traveling in the Immortal World, she had seen many children who liked to squat and play with the ants on the ground. They surrounded the ants. This situation was identical.
 Han Jue said expressionlessly, “I’ll let you see my power since you insist on fighting me. What right do I have to shock the Chaos? Watch carefully!”
 The Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial roared angrily, scaring Han Qing’er so much that she trembled. She subconsciously wanted to escape, but she was imprisoned by a terrifying force and could not move. Even her soul couldn’t leave her body.
 Impossible!
 Han Qing’er’s face was pale. She could only watch as the Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial punched.
 The killing intent was real!
 Her father was not joking with her!
 Boom
 The Heavenly Constellation Fiendcelestial punched out, and Han Qing’er’s body and soul were destroyed.
  Han Qing’er opened her eyes and gasped. Her head was covered in a cold sweat and she looked terrified.
 Qingluan’er asked with concern, “What’s wrong?” The dream was too fast. Han Jue chatted with her as he fought, so she didn’t notice that Han Qing’er was pulled into the dream by her father.
 Han Jue asked with a faint smile, “Are we still going to fight?”
 Han Qing’er shook her head frantically.
 Qingluan’er’s expression darkened as she looked at Han Jue upon seeing her so frightened.
 Han Jue coughed. “It’s nothing. I just fought with her in my dream and didn’t hurt her. She’s just shocked. Sigh, how dare she challenge me with this mentality? She still wants to surpass her big brother?”
 Han Qing’er blushed, but she couldn’t help but shiver when she thought of the scene just now.
 How terrifying!
 So her father was so terrifying when he was serious!
 No wonder the Sages in the Universal Hall were so respectful to him. Had they been beaten like this in the past?
