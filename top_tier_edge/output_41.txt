 Han Jue opened his eyes and looked at the Great Dao Tower first. After so many years, the Great Dao Tower regained its peace and prosperity. Zhou Fan was still cultivating in the tower.
 Compared to ten thousand years ago, the number of living beings in the Great Dao Tower had doubled. Han Jue counted with his fingers and couldn’t help but smile.
 It turned out that the news of him defeating Ancestor Xitian had already spread. Many living beings who hated or were afraid of Life felt that the Great Dao Tower could protect them and went there.
 It was not only the Great Dao Tower. The Heavenly Dao and the Heavenly Court were also affected. However, the Heavenly Court had a very high threshold for the Heavenly troops. They would not accept ordinary living beings. Unlike the Great Dao Tower, the Heavenly Court was more like an army.
 Han Juels gaze landed on the Heavenly Court. After the Heavenly Court gained a reputation from Life, the number of immortals increased greatly
 It had to be said that the Evil Heavenly Emperor was still very good at using his reputation and power.
 Han Jue was no longer worried upon seeing that the Heavenly Court and the Great Dao Tower were fine.
 He looked at Chu Shiren’s Buddhist World
  The Buddhist World had used a special array formation and was actually hidden in deep space-time. Only Great Dao Sages and existences above could spy on it.
 Han Jue noticed an aura of freedom in the Buddhist World.
 Eh?
 Chu Shiren had really succeeded?
 He checked his profile picture.
 The portrait was still there, which meant that he had not been possessed. The favorability had not changed, which meant that he had not been brainwashed. Everything was normal.
 Chu Shiren was interesting.
 Han Jue began to look forward to what he would do in the future.
 Then, Han Jue sent a dream to Li Daokong and asked about his recent situation.
 Although Li Daokong was very loyal, there was a possibility that something would happen if he was left alone. Li Daokong might be experiencing torture and struggling when Han Jue was still cultivating.
 In the dream, Li Daokong was indeed very excited and happy to see him.
 Li Daokong and the other two suffered immense pressure in the Life faction after the defeat with the Great Dao Tower. Li Daokong and Shi Dudao were very aggrieved, but they had no choice.
 Han Jue asked, “I can save you and help you eliminate the Calamity Life Controller’s karma if you can’t take it.”
 Li Daokong was stunned and pleasantly surprised.
 He had felt despair when he understood the true terror of a Calamity Life Controller. He didn’t expect Han Jue to help him resolve it.
 He believed that Han Jue was not bragging. After all, so many lives had been lost in his hands.
 He hesitated for a moment and gritted his teeth. “It’s fine, Sect Master. I can still tolerate it. Furthermore, my cultivation speed has indeed far exceeded before by relying on my identity as a Calamity Life Controller. This is also my opportunity.” Han Jue said, “Don’t feel burdened. Use the Invocation Technique to summon me at any time once you can’t hold on, understand?”
 Li Daokong nodded. “I understand. Thank you for your concern, Sect Master.”
 The two of them chatted for a while more before ending the dream.
 Han Jue sent a dream to Shi Dudao next. This time, he used the image of the Dark Forbidden Lord.
 Shi Dudao was also suffering. He was tortured by the Calamity Life Controller’s fate. He wanted to show his cards several times, but he was afraid that he would appear weak and be looked down on by the Dark Forbidden Lord.
 His dissatisfaction instantly dissipated upon seeing the Dark Forbidden Lord.
 He secretly admired him.
 The Dark Forbidden Lord appeared when he was about to collapse. Wasn’t it to give him hope and motivation?
 Shi Dudao was still convinced even though he knew that this was a method.
 At the very least, it meant that the Dark Forbidden Lord really cared about him and he was not a pawn that could be abandoned at any time.
 Han Jue said bluntly, “I can help you escape and find a place to cultivate in peace if you can’t take it.”
 Shi Dudao asked, “Then, can I still follow you?”
 “Yes, but it’s another form of following.”
 Shi Dudao understood.
 The other was to rear him and wait for the opportunity when he was needed.
 He didn’t want this!
 “However, every supreme expert has to experience pain and despair before they can continue to grow and climb higher.”
 Shi Dudao nodded. He also believed this.
 However, the Dark Forbidden Lord said that he was the most talented. This made him very excited.
 He indeed thought so before leaving the Heavenly Dao.
 However, he had seen too many geniuses after wandering in the Chaos for so long. He had thought that he was very mediocre, especially after being crushed by the Evil Heavenly Emperor. He doubted himself even more.
 Usually, there was Li Daokong, this dog, beside him. If it were anyone else, they would also be easily heartbroken.
 Shi Dudao suppressed his excitement and asked, “Really?”
nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎 Han Jue said, “I have no need to lie to you. Your talent is not determined by my mouth. If there is a talent stronger than you, why don’t I look for him?”
 Shi Dudao felt that it made sense.
 “In that case, I’ll continue to hide in Life. I want to be your most capable War God!” Shi Dudao said proudly and regained his previous conceit.
 Han Jue smiled in satisfaction.
 The dream ended an hour later.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and frowned.
 He smiled in satisfaction.
 He was still very talented in bluffing. Han Jue started to check his emails next.
 In the Daoist temple next door.
 Xing Hongxuan was meditating on the bed when she suddenly frowned.
 Her consciousness entered a dream.
 After a while, she opened her eyes and she discovered that she was standing beside a lake. Immortal Qi surrounded her and the scenery was beautiful.
 “Dream?”
 Xing Hongxuan frowned. She was already a Primordial Chaos Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal. How could she be dreaming?
 She subconsciously touched her abdomen. She had always felt something unfathomable ever since she got pregnant.
 She knew that her son was not simple. She was also worried that her son would attract danger, but she had no choice but to endure.
 Suddenly realizing that she couldn’t leave the dream, she began to observe her surroundings.
 Clouds surrounded her, preventing her from seeing where she was.
  At this moment.
 A figure walked towards her on the lake.
 Soon, the figure walked out of the clouds and revealed her true body.
 Xing Hongxuan was stunned.
 The other party looked identical to her, but her temperament was more extraordinary.
 Xing Hongxuan wore white and stood on the lotus throne. The sun and moon floated behind her and surrounded her like gods.
 Xing Hongxuan stared at her and sized her up carefully.
 The other party slowly said, “Don’t let your son be born. He will attract unprecedented trouble. Even your husband can’t stop him.”
 Xing Hongxuan frowned. She seemed to have thought of something and asked, “Are you the future me?”
 The other party said slowly, “There’s no future or past. I’m just talking to myself. You have to choose between your son and your husband.”


 Impossible!
 Xing Hongxuan fell silent.
 The other party continued, “Besides, you can’t guarantee if the child you give birth to is good or bad. You can already sense his talent. Can you really control him if he’s evil?
 “He can make you stronger, so he’s naturally stronger. He was born with the strongest power. He was born to be a calamity. He shouldn’t have been born. Your husband didn’t want him at first. You insisted on having him.
 “Don’t think it’s cruel. You have to end the karma you started.”
  Xing Hongxuan opened her eyes after waking up.
 She touched her abdomen with a pained expression.
 Was it really because of her willfulness?
 She suddenly thought of something and felt relieved.
 “What am I conflicted about? It’s all thanks to you that I can be where I am today. This child’s talent is not inherited from me but from you. I shouldn’t be worried about this but tell you instead,” Xing Hongxuan muttered to herself and stood up to visit Han Jue.
 Han Jue was still checking his emails and thinking about some interesting ones when he sensed Xing Hongxuan’s aura and immediately opened the door to the Daoist temple to let her in.
 Xing Hongxuan sat down beside Han Jue and told him about the dream.
 Han Jue was not surprised. He already knew about this.
 However, he was very satisfied with Xing Hongxuan’s performance.
 “You did well. You have to tell me if you don’t understand something. Don’t deal with it yourself.” Han Jue pulled Xing Hongxuan’s hand and patted the back of it with a satisfied smile.
 It would be troublesome if Xing Hongxuan couldn’t figure it out and killed her son or went to the extreme, wanting to lead her son to escape and cause a series of consequences.
 Xing Hongxuan giggled. “Perhaps this is a trap to mess with my heart and tie you down?”
 Han Jue said, “I’ll calculate it. Maintain your previous state for the time being. Cultivate when you need to. You have to continue cultivating after attaining the Primordial Chaos Dao Fruit, understand?”
 Xing Hongxuan nodded and left several hours later. She heaved a sigh of relief.
 Inside the Daoist temple.
 Han Jue began to use the derivation function. “Xing Hongxuan’s dream really met her future self?”
 (500 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [It’s indeed the future her.]
 The future her was worth 500 billion years?
 Han Jue continued to ask, “Is the future her telling the truth or a conspiracy?”
 (500 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?] Continue!
 [It involves the Supreme Rule and cannot be directly deduced.)
 Han Jue showed a frown.
 In other words, he couldn’t be sure if the other party was telling the truth. It might be caused by the enemy’s bewitchment.
 This was a warning. The enemy could also use the future to attack the past!
 It seemed that he had to calculate the future!
Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates “I want to know what will happen after the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity ends?”
 Actually, he knew very well that he would change the future every time he looked at it.
 However, it did not mean that predicting the future was useless. At least, it could allow him to avoid many troubles.
 For example, the Evil Heavenly Emperor. If not for Han Jue’s frequent interference, his body and soul would have been destroyed more than a million years ago.
 (5 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 So much!
 Continue!
 Han Jue entered the illusion.
 The long-awaited dizziness appeared. Han Jue opened his eyes and his consciousness quickly became clear.
 What reflected in his eyes was the Primordial Void. Purple light filled the air and wisps of Chaotic Qi interwove in the void like lightning Desolate and empty!
 Everything turned into nothingness!
 Han Jue frowned. What was going on?
 Space suddenly shrank and became dazzling.
 He suddenly saw a figure.
 The figure sat on a stone chair. This stone chair was strange and sinister. Several heads were embedded in the top. Han Jue had seen one of the heads in the Grand Primordium Domain. It was one of the Chaotic Fiendcelestials.
 Han Jue narrowed his eyes and discovered that this figure was not him.
 Who was this?
 The person on the stone chair wore a black-patterned purple robe. His hair was disheveled and his body emitted an extremely terrifying aura.
 He had an extremely handsome face, but his eyes were cold and there was a cruel smile on his lips.
 Who was this fellow?
 Han Jue didn’t have the slightest idea who he was.
 He only felt that the other party looked familiar, like Han Tuo and Han Yu.
 Could it be his unborn son?
 The purple-robed figure raised his hands with a fascinated expression and muttered, “All of this belongs to me. No one can stop me anymore. I am the only Primordial Fiendcelestial and the only existence. I create everything. I will be a Primordial Deity, the supreme existence!”
 Han Jue had a strange expression.
 It was really his son.
 What did he mean by the only existence?
 Don’t tell me you killed me, too?
 At this moment, the dream shattered.
 Han Jue’s consciousness returned to reality.
 He began to think.
 If it was his youngest son, he had to throw him into the Primordial Heavenly Prison before he grew up to prevent this fellow from killing him.
 But on second thought, he felt that something was wrong. He could hide in the Dao Field even if he couldn’t defeat his son in the future.
 Perhaps he would fake his death?
 Han Jue didn’t use the derivation function again. All of this was still too far away. He couldn’t jump to conclusions.
 The Primordial Fiendcelestial would successfully overturn the Chaos if the situation did not change. Perhaps it was because of the Dao Field that his son could grow to an invincible stage.
  The future he just saw might indeed happen as long as his son did not leave the Dao Field.
 “Therefore, I have to cultivate diligently and not slack off. They are all Primordial Fiendcelestials. Only if I give up cultivating will I be caught up by another Primordial Fiendcelestial.”
 Han Jue’s eyes became firm.
 Cultivate!
 He closed his eyes and entered his cultivation state.
 In the dark space, boundless Chaotic Qi filled the air like mist.
 Yi Tian and a figure stood beside a lake. The surface of the lake was murky and kept stirring.
 He turned to look at the figure beside him and asked, “Devil Ancestor, why isn’t he out yet?”
 His face was pale and his facial features were angular. There were three vertical patterns between his eyebrows and his black hair was as long as his robe. He looked like a nightmare, terrifying.


 Yi Tian scratched his head and asked, “When will it be my turn?”
 Lu Yuan glanced at him and snorted. “You’re not as tenacious as him. You can’t withstand the pain.”
 “I don’t like what you’re saying. I’m his big brother, after all. I’m better than him in all aspects!”
 “Hehe.”
 Yi Tian curled his lips unhappily upon seeing that the Devil Ancestor Lu Yuan did not believe him.
 Unknowingly, he was like Han Tuo’s younger brother now.
 There were still waves on the surface of the lake, and he could not see the situation at the bottom.
 After a long time.
  The Devil Ancestor Lu Yuan left and disappeared into the fog. Yi Tian meditated by the lake and waited patiently.
 After a certain period of time.
 Boom!
 The surface of the lake suddenly exploded. Yi Tian opened his eyes and saw that a figure had already appeared in front of him, occupying his entire vision.
 Han Tuo!
 He was naked, and his figure was as burly as the Ancestral Magus. His white hair fluttered in the wind and his muscles were like dragons and snakes. As he moved, he was filled with the beauty of explosive power.
 Yi Tian was stunned and remained silent.
 Han Tuo’s handsome face also became more domineering, and his eyes turned green.
 He sized up his body and smiled.
 He raised his hand and clenched his fingers into a fist. The surrounding space twisted as if even space was grabbed into his palm.
 Yi Tian stood up and asked, “How do you feel?”
 Yi Tian asked, “Does the process hurt? What do you think of me? Can I withstand it?”
 “Nonsense. The two of us will advance and retreat together. I have to force you in even if you’re afraid!”
 Han Tuo snorted. His words pleased him.
 Yi Tian was most afraid that Han Tuo would begin to pity him. That meant that the difference between the two had already reached a point where he couldn’t catch up to.
 “Then, I’ll go down now?”
 “Hurry up, I’m still waiting to fight you!”
 “Alright!”
 Plop!
 Yi Tian jumped into the lake and disappeared.
 Han Tuo crossed his legs and sat in midair to cultivate.
 Time passed quickly. Wind and clouds surged in the Immortal World.
 Qin Ling and Xia Zhizun appeared in the vision of all living beings again. To cultivators who had surpassed the Deity Realm, hundreds of thousands of years were very short, but to all living beings, hundreds of thousands of years was a long era. The legends of their previous lives were buried in the various providence sects. Their current fame was mainly because of their deeds. They wreaked havoc in the netherworld, barged into the Dragon Palace, and dominated the three schools of the Dao Sect. They were invincible among those below a million years old.
 Most importantly, Qin Ling publicly declared that he wanted to seek justice from the Buddhist Sect!
 Why did the Buddhist Sect have to hurt mortals without paying the price!
 Could subduing demons and devils make up for all the sins?
 Many cultivators used the banner of peace to be fearless, as if the death of one person could not shake the kindness that had saved thousands of people.
 The Providence Sects gave the greatest pressure to all living beings. How was peace established? Wasn’t it the power formed by the providence sects? They had absolutely cruel methods to scare all living beings away from breaking the peace.
 Qin Ling’s encounter was not a special case. He had awakened the hatred in the hearts of all living beings.
  Later, Qin Ling became a Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal and brought a group of good friends to barge into the Buddhist Sect and fight against the gods and Buddhas. Unfortunately, he still suffered a crushing defeat. If not for the appearance of the master of the Divine Palace, Zhang Guxing, the Buddhist Sect would have killed Qin Ling in the name of righteousness.
 Even so, the Buddhist Sect still sealed Qin Ling under Thunderclap Monastery for a hundred thousand years as a warning.
 The Divine Palace was in the wrong and could only agree.
 All living beings were dejected, thinking that peace could not be overturned.
 However, during the period when Qin Ling was suppressed, cultivators constantly visited him. Because the Buddhist Sect did not send any disciples to guard him, after the visitors talked to Qin Ling, they discovered that he still did not give in. He said that after a hundred thousand years, he still wanted to fight the Buddhist Sect.
 His spirit began to spread. As time passed, it constantly infected countless people who had suffered in their later lives. He was also valued by many ambitious people who wanted to overthrow the Buddhist Sect.
 The true Immeasurable Calamity began to brew!
 Han Jue opened his eyes and smiled. He felt refreshed.
 He had cultivated in seclusion for 80,000 years!
 Awesome!
 He suddenly thought of something.
 Those supreme existences would definitely enter seclusion for a longer time. Han Jue took advantage of their seclusion to quietly rise. Wasn’t there another possibility? Heaven-defying geniuses also rose in the Heavenly Dao amidst his seclusion.
 Perhaps the next time he opened his eyes, the Heavenly Dao would have already changed?
 It was fine. When the time came, he would let the clone that opened the door for Li Xuan’ao stare at the Heavenly Dao. This would be fine.
 Han Jue began to observe the Heavenly Dao.
 Recently, the Heavenly Dao had two more Heavenly Dao Sages.
 They were called Tai Sutian and Tian Zhan.
 Han Jue was really surprised that Ji Xianshen could support his disciple so quickly.
 Among the current Heavenly Dao Sages, too many people were related to Han Jue. It was impossible for the Sages to give him a chance just because Ji Xianshen was his disciple. It was probably because of Ji Xianshen’s efforts.
 Generally speaking, there was no problem with the Heavenly Dao. It was still steadily developing, and there were no unstable factors internally.
 Han Jue retracted his gaze and started to check his emails.
 As he read, only two emails caught his attention.
 (Your son Han Tuo devoured a Chaotic Fiendcelestial and his cultivation increased greatly.]
 (Your good friend Yi Tian devoured a Chaotic Fiendcelestial and his cultivation increased greatly.]
 Devour a Chaotic Fiendcelestial?
 What was going on? Han Jue frowned. These two emails were sent not long ago.
 Now that the Chaotic Fiendcelestials were already united, the Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial would probably find trouble with Han Jue.
 Han Jue noticed that the cultivation of these two brats had already soared to the perfected Primordial Chaos Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm.
  This was too fast!
 Should he ask?
 He hesitated.
 That was not good. He couldn’t stop his son from risking his life to develop independently, right?
 (The Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial sent you a dream. Do you accept?]
 Han Jue sighed upon seeing the message that suddenly appeared in front of him.
 This fellow was finally here!
 He thought for a moment and decided to pretend to be dead.
 The Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial was a late-stage Great Dao Supreme existence. Han Jue was not its match for the time being.
 If this fellow attacked Han Tuo and the other two, Han Jue could only take out the Dark Forbidden Lord to divert the Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial’s attention.


 [The Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial sent you a dream. Do you accept?]
 [The Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial sent you a dream. Do you accept?]
 Notifications kept appearing in front of Han Jue, making him speechless.
 It was fine if the Sages did this, but the Great Dao Supreme was still so anxious!
 What nonsense was this?
 Han Jue thought for a moment and still chose to accept the dream.
 The dream was the palace of the Grand Primordium Domain.
 Han Jue saw the Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial meditating ten thousand feet away.
 Their eyes met and neither side spoke immediately.
  The atmosphere was strange and awkward.
 After a long while…
 The Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial asked, “Han Jue, do you know what your son did?”
 Han Jue said, “I know. He was bewitched by the Devil Ancestor. However, the Devil Ancestor is too strong. I’m helpless.”
 Speaking of this, he couldn’t help but sigh in shame.
 The Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial stared at him and asked, “You mean that he’s being controlled by the Devil Ancestor now and is no longer himself?”
 “That’s right. Otherwise, why would I let him follow the Devil Ancestor?”
 Han Jue nodded and sighed. “I didn’t want to trouble the Fiendcelestial Race about this. After all, the Devil Ancestor didn’t attack the Heavenly Dao and only abducted one of my sons. I couldn’t ask for help. I didn’t expect Senior Grand Primordium to take the initiative to mention it. I’m really touched, and I feel even more ashamed. I underestimated the unity of the Fiendcelestial Race and the arrogance of the Chaotic Fiendcelestials.”
 The Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial was silent.
 Han Jue was immersed in sorrow and helplessness as he sighed.
 After a while.
 The Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial said, “The Fiendcelestial Race will declare war on the Devil Ancestor. I will help you save your son. Wait for the order.”
 u sa
 With that, the dream shattered.
 [The Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial has developed hatred towards you. Current Hatred Points: 2 stars]
 Han Jue opened his eyes and almost took out the Book of Misfortune when he saw this notification.
 It was obvious that the Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial was also an old fox. It didn’t believe Han Jue at all, but it couldn’t blame him.
 This was also good. He could let the Fiendcelestial Race restrain the Devil Ancestor. It would be best if they fought until both sides were injured. Han Jue would attack Life again, causing a delay to the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity and giving the Heavenly Dao time to rise.
 Han Jue sent a dream to Han Tuo.
 The dream was on a city wall. It was the old city that Han Tuo had guarded when he was young
 Han Tuo opened his eyes and was stunned when he saw this scene.
 He noticed him and hurriedly came back to his senses. He knelt down and bowed.
 “Father!”
 Han Jue looked at Han Tuo, who was much stronger than before, and sighed.
 The current Han Tuo really looked like a demon.
 Han Jue said, “How have you been?”
 Facing his question, Han Tuo did not hide anything. He told him everything about fusing the demonic path and devouring the Chaotic Fiendcelestial.
 This also indirectly proved that Han Tuo did not have a change of heart towards Han Jue.
 Devil Ancestor Lu Yuan had already recovered his body. His short-term goal was to gather the devils again. As for the future plans, Han Tuo did not know for the time being.
 Han Jue said, “The Chaotic Fiendcelestials will hunt you and the Devil Ancestor down. This happened because of you. Be very careful.”
 Han Tuo was moved, but he did not panic.
 The threat level of a Chaotic Fiendcelestial and that of the entire Fiendcelestial Race was worlds apart.
 Furthermore, the Chaotic Fiendcelestials they had fought before were all at the bottom or severely injured.
 “I understand.”
 Han Tuo agreed.
 Han Jue was a little disappointed upon seeing that he didn’t need his help. He said, “Remember, don’t say that I revealed the information. If you really can’t hold on, you can summon me at any time.”
 Han Tuo opened his eyes. He sat on a white skeleton that was as huge as a mountain range. Yi Tian was still alive beside him.
 Yi Tian smiled and said, “You were in a daze just now. Could it be that your father was visiting you in your dreams?”.
 They had just finished devouring the Chaotic Fiendcelestials. There might be a reaction between them.
 Han Tuo said, “No, but the situation might not be good.”
 He looked up at the dark universe and felt that there were pairs of eyes staring at him.
 Yi Tian sighed. “This Fiendcelestial Qi, blood, and providence are really good things. No wonder Pangu wanted to kill three thousand Fiendcelestials and absorb their providence. How strong is he?”
 “Don’t think about it. It’s impossible for us to reach that height. After all, there are only dozens of Chaotic Fiendcelestials alive now. Most of them are the strongest existences in the Chaos.” Han Tuo shook his head.
 Yi Tian chuckled.
 At this moment, a voice floated into their ears.
 “Leave this place and return to the Demonic Path Abyss.”
 It was the Devil Ancestor Lu Yuan’s voice.
 The two of them immediately stood up and left without hesitation.
 Their greatest reliance now was the Devil Ancestor Lu Yuan. There was definitely trouble if even he said so.
 In the blink of an eye.
 Han Jue entered seclusion for another ten thousand years.
 He was already 1.6 million years old!
 He opened his eyes and took out the Book of Misfortune to curse the Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial.
 After so long, the Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial shouldn’t think of Han Jue if he was cursed.
 He checked his emails while cursing.
 There was no email message from Han Tuo and Yi Tian. They had probably been hiding in seclusion for the past ten thousand years.
 Five days later.
 Han Jue put down the Book of Misfortune.
 He only wanted to divert the Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial’s attention and not curse it to death.
 Han Jue hesitated again after putting away the Book of Misfortune.
 Wasn’t five short days too light?
 After thinking about it, Han Jue took out the Book of Misfortune and started cursing again.
 Another five days passed.
 Han Jue’s lifespan began to decrease, but he didn’t stop. He still cursed the Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial with all his might.
 Even the First Life Black Sovereign could be cursed until something went wrong. Han Jue was naturally confident in dealing with the Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial.
 A hundred million years!
 10 billion years!
 A trillion years!
 100 trillion years!
 1 quadrillion years!
 10 quadrillion years!
 Han Jue started to feel the pinch. Fortunately, an email finally appeared.
 Han Jue immediately stopped.
  It took him ten quadrillion years to curse until something went wrong…
 Wasn’t it impossible to curse him to death?
 The Book of Misfortune was clearly a Great Dao Supreme Treasure. This thing lacked the power to end things.
 Han Jue smiled and became happy. He continued cultivating.
 Grand Primordium Domain, in the palace.
 “What a terrifying curse! Could it be the legendary Dark Forbidden Lord?
 “To be able to hurt me, the other party must be a Great Dao Supreme. Could it be the Great Dao of Curses?” the Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial muttered to himself, his eyes filled with killing intent.
 This action was extremely sinister!


 “No, I can’t just sit here and wait for death.”
 The Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial’s eyes flickered. He recalled the legends of the Dark Forbidden Lord and knew that he couldn’t wait for death.
 He carefully recalled the curse power and fell into deep thought.
 The curse power of the Dark Forbidden Lord was domineering and long-lasting. It was extremely strange.
 He wanted to know if the Dark Forbidden Lord was a Curse Fiendcelestial and how he cursed.
 In addition, he had to find a way to avoid this curse!
 The Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial closed his eyes and began to circulate his energy to heal his injuries.
 He had to recuperate first.
 How many years had it been? He had not been injured for a long time, and even his Great Dao was damaged.
 eness was
 He finally met his match!
 Immortal World, Far West.
 Under a magnificent mountain, a man meditated against the mountain wall. Talismans were stuck to his body and the surrounding mountain wall.
 This man was Qin Ling.
 His hair was disheveled and his clothes were tattered.
 At this moment, a man and woman walked along the mountain path.
 The man was handsome and the woman was cold.
 They were Han Yu and the woman in green.
 The woman in green saw Qin Ling from afar and asked curiously, “Senior, is he that famous peerless prodigy, Qin Ling?”
 For some reason, the woman in green felt that Qin Ling looked familiar, as if she had seen him somewhere before.
 Han Yu did not reply and slowly walked in front of Qin Ling.
 When he announced that he would challenge the Buddhist Sect, all living beings gave him too much hope, but he failed.
 He was utterly defeated.
 Han Yu asked, “Do you regret it?”
 Han Yu did not ask further and looked at him quietly.
 At first glance, Qin Ling was suffering more than all living beings.
 However, he knew that Qin Ling was the exact opposite. He was happier than all living beings. All living beings treated him as the hope of salvation. Little did he know that he was only a pawn used by the Sages to appease the anger of all living beings. Furthermore, once this pawn succeeded, he would jump out of his identity as a pawn and even leave the Heavenly Dao.
 All living beings were still in the sea of suffering, while Qin Ling continued to pursue his Dao in the Chaos.
 Han Yu felt sorrow.
 He felt sorrow for all living beings.
 At the same time, Han Yu believed in one thing.
 What the naked eye saw might not be the truth. What he had pursued his entire life was only an illusion.
 If not for Han Yu having his father’s backing, he might not have been able to see through everything below the Heavenly Dao.
 After the sorrow, Han Yu was even more determined.
 He wanted to truly benefit all living beings!
 Han Yu’s eyes became firm.
 He found the determination to cultivate.
 The woman in green stared at Qin Ling and came to a realization. Wasn’t this the mighty figure who had visited Han Yu back then?
 She couldn’t help but look at them strangely.
 At this moment, Han Yu left. The woman in green hurriedly followed.
 After the two of them left, the woman in green asked, “Isn’t that your grand-disciple? Why did he reincarnate?”
 She still remembered that when she first met Qin Ling, he was high-spirited and powerful. Therefore, she couldn’t understand why such an expert would reincarnate and his current situation.
 Han Yu replied, “This is fate. The suffering he experienced in this life far exceeds your past, but you already know his identity in his previous life. That’s right, his reincarnation this time is only to train. Do you think his suffering in this life is important to his true identity?”
 The woman in green was silent.
 Fifty thousand years passed in a flash.
 Han Jue’s cultivation improved again, making him very satisfied.
 He opened his eyes and looked outside the Daoist temple. Han Yu was kneeling.
 Thousands of years ago, Han Yu came to visit alone and was moved into the Hundred Peak Immortal River by his clone. Han Yu asked along the way and came to the Daoist temple to kneel and wait.
 He looked too similar to Han Jue!
 At first glance, Han Yu looked like Han Jue’s illegitimate son, but they were all mighty figures. They knew that Han Yu was Han Jue’s descendant.
 He said, “Come in.”
 The door to the Daoist temple opened and Han Yu stood up.
 He stopped in front of him and knelt down again, bowing respectfully.
 Han Jue smiled. “Sorry to make you wait. Actually, you can find a place to cultivate. There’s no need to wait. Didn’t the guard outside tell you my seclusion rules?”
 Han Yu said, “I know. I just feel that I have something to ask of you.”
 “Oh? What is it?” Han Jue smiled.
 Finally, someone came to ask him for a favor.
 Han Yu saw Han Jue smile and felt nervous. His smile gave the feeling that he was seen through. He felt ridiculous.
 His tone was firm. He was already mentally prepared after kneeling for thousands of years.
 Han Jue asked, “Why?”
 Han Jue blinked. Why did it feel like he was insinuating something?
 However, he could sense Han Yu’s determination.
 Han Jue sent a voice transmission to Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du and decided on this matter.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du agreed immediately.
 Han Yu was uneasy. After all, this matter was too big. It could even be said to be the number one matter of the Heavenly Dao.
 Everyone wanted to attain the Dao!
 Han Jue said, “Yes, this matter is settled. Cultivate in the Hundred Peak Immortal River for ten thousand years before going to the 33rd Heaven to find Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du.”
 Han Yu was stunned. He was speechless.
 Han Jue waved his sleeve and said, “Remember what you said.”
 Inside the Daoist temple.
 Han Jue started to check his emails. As for Han Yu, he had already forgotten about him.
  What was a mere Sage position?
 How many Sages in the current Sage circle were related to him? He was not afraid of being gossiped about. This was also a symbol of his authority.
 Ten thousand years later.
 Han Yu arrived outside the 33rd Heaven and visited Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du in front of the Universal Hall.
 The door opened.
 Han Yu entered the hall and saw that not only was Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du here, but another five Sages were also present. They were Heavenly Venerate Wufa, Fang Liang, Ji Xianshen, Pan Xin, and the new Sage Tian Zhan.
 The five Sages had different expressions when they saw Han Yu.
 Tian Zhan had never seen Han Yu, but for a Pseudo-Sage to enter the Universal Hall, and with the Sages present, he was probably not simple.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “Han Yu, sit behind Fellow Daoist Fang.”
 Han Yu looked up. He wanted to ask who Fellow Daoist Fang was, but he saw Fang Liang waving at him without the bearing of a Sage.
