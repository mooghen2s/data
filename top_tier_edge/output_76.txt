 How dishonest!
 Why didn’t he talk about his own circumstances? Was he worried about his reputation or did he have other intentions?
 “But it’s impossible for you to succeed with the Chaos around.
 “I’ve observed you. You keep saying that you don’t want to cause trouble, but what you really want is independence.
 “Absolute independence is actually strength. You actually pursue power.”
 The Chaotic Consciousness stared at Han Jue with its eight eyes, making him feel weak.
 This was malicious flattery. He wanted to elevate him and force him to go against the Ninth Chaos.
 Han Jue said, “Deity, you’re being too serious. I’ve never bullied anyone. Why would I do that?”
 The Chaotic Consciousness said, “Then, are you prepared to submit to the Ninth Chaos?”
 Han Jue said, “Not for the time being. Anyway, I don’t even have the thought of creating a Great Dao World.”
 He did not say anything absolute to avoid offending the Chaotic Consciousness.
 In any case, he would delay and keep the Chaotic Consciousness guessing.
 “Let’s not talk about the Dao Creator Realm. Even if you have an opportunity, it’s difficult to create a Great Dao World in less than a trillion years. I came to you this time to talk about the Consciousnessless Great Dao World.
 “There are many living beings there. After being suppressed by the Chaos, these living beings can’t go to the Chaos and don’t have Spirit Qi. Those who survive are mortals who don’t need Spirit Qi to survive. These living beings have been occupied by jealousy for a long time. They hate the Chaos.
 Han Jue raised his eyebrows.
 A trap!
 Isn’t the Consciousnessless Great Dao World yours?
 Han Jue would not believe his words if the Chaotic Consciousness did not reveal this.
 The Chaotic Consciousness said, “I hope that you can go and educate these living beings. If you can’t, organize the Chaos and kill all the vengeful spirits of the Great Dao World.”
 Han Jue asked, “Who else did you tell this?”
 “You are already the strongest in the Chaos. I will only find the strongest. You can decide what to do.”
 With that said, the surrounding corpses instantly exploded and the dream ended.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and frowned.
 Wow!
 What a schemer!
 If it were anyone else, without knowing that the Consciousnessless Great Dao World belonged to the Chaotic Consciousness, they would definitely be excited after hearing this, thinking that they had been recognized by the Chaotic Deity and were given power and responsibility.
 However, Han Jue knew that this was a huge trap.
 “Didn’t you say that it will take me a trillion years to break through? I’ll start after a hundred million years.”
 Han Jue thought silently and felt that the Chaotic Consciousness should not be in a hurry.
 Time passed very quickly for Dao Creators. Ten million years was like an instant and not worth mentioning.
 Then, Han Jue stopped thinking and quickly started cultivating.
 Han Ling was still playing with the half-moon red jade. She loved it and looked like a cute girl for once.
 Ultimate God World.
 The Ultimate God of Punishment sized up the five Divine Punishers in front of him with a satisfied expression.
 The other Divine Punishers also smiled and nodded.
 Back then, they were almost crippled when the Ancient Desolate Divine Spirit appeared.
 If it was just shaking hands and making peace, they would at most keep their Divine Punisher positions. How could he nurture them so diligently?
 This meant that they were all on the same side!
 The Ultimate God of Punishment smiled. “I’ll discuss this with the Divine Might Heavenly Sage. Han Huang is indeed unstoppable, but someone among you has to enter the Chaotic Ten Absolutes.”
 “The Chaotic Ten Absolutes will definitely be fine! We’ll take care of it!” Yi Tian said smugly. Han Tuo rolled his eyes. “Don’t talk nonsense. I suspect that my father still has many absurdly powerful subordinates.”
 Yi Tian’s smile froze.
 The Ultimate God of Punishment smiled and said, “Don’t always think of the Divine Might Heavenly Sage’s subordinates. The Hidden Sect has a deep foundation, but the Chaos still has other geniuses. Many stunning figures have appeared in the past million years. Some geniuses who have been in seclusion have also begun to build momentum. The Chaotic Assembly will be very exciting. You can’t be careless. Take advantage of the last four million years and work hard.”
 He paused and said, “You know the Supreme Rules, but don’t you know the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority? The Chaotic Fiendcelestials control the power of the Great Dao, and the power of the Supreme Rules is the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority. It’s equivalent to being above the Chaotic Fiendcelestials. Currently, there are only seven Great Dao Providence Divine Authority. If I obtain one, there will be a Great Dao Providence Divine Authority at the Eternal Peak!
 “This will be the closest path for you to reach the peak! Such an opportunity is something I never thought of before!”
 The five Divine Punishers widened their eyes and breathed heavily.
 Even Han Tuo was the same!
 Great Dao Providence Divine Authority!
 The Ultimate God of Punishment continued, “I will begin to build momentum for the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority, but this award will not be made public for now. It will only be informed to all living beings after the top of the world is determined. Therefore, this information is to your advantage as the Divine Punishers.”
 Yi Tian cursed. “I’ll do it! Sorry, Han Huang, I won’t let you go anymore!”
 Han Tuo said faintly, “Second Brother attained the Great Dao Supreme Realm not long ago.”
 Yi Tian’s eyes turned red. He glared at him and asked, “You want to give up?”
 Han Tuo was silent.
 How could he give up!
 The Great Dao Providence Divine Authority was a supreme opportunity to walk towards the peak of the Chaos. It was above the three thousand Great Dao.
 The other three Divine Punishers were also very excited. The Ultimate God of Punishment smiled and disappeared.
 It was the same for the Heavenly Court. Han Huang was still the most dazzling star.
 However, many geniuses were not convinced.
 This was how geniuses were. They all thought that they could kill enemies above their level. They were the most talented!
 Not to mention the Chaos, the Heavenly Dao also had many such geniuses.
 For example, Azure Heaven Mystic and Zhao Shuangquan. Azure Heaven Mystic was a pawn of the Chaotic Consciousness. Needless to say, his potential was even more impressive. Zhao Shuangquan was the Eighth Chaos’s reincarnation. The two often sparred, but Azure Heaven Mystic started cultivation early and thus always suppressed him.
 However, the Heavenly Dao Sages nurtured the two of them fairly. They tried their best to satisfy whatever they wanted.
 On this day.
 In Su Qi’s palace, Zhao Shuangquan was excitedly recounting his recent achievements.
 Zhao Shuangquan and Azure Heaven Mystic would also wander the Chaos from time to time and build their reputation.
 Su Qi said helplessly, “Why are you like Azure Heaven Mystic? You’re arrogant and fearless. You’ll suffer sooner or later.”


 “I’m different from Azure Heaven Mystic. He’s a coward who only knows how to bark and doesn’t dare to kill easily. He’s simply stupid. He’s often humiliated but lets them survive. He’ll be doomed sooner or later. I’m different. I’m only arrogant to my opponent. I can’t be bothered if there’s no karma.”
 Zhao Shuangquan snorted with disdain.
 Su Qi could only smile helplessly at the grudge between Azure Heaven Mystic and Zhao Shuangquan.
 Su Qi said, “There’s more and more news about the Chaotic Assembly. The various factions in the Chaos are building momentum. The Heavenly Dao is preparing to support you and Azure Heaven Mystic, but currently, you don’t have any impressive achievements. Your range of activity has always been in the Heavenly Dao Alliance. Your defeated opponents have more or less given the Heavenly Dao face.”
 Zhao Shuangquan was silent.
 Su Qi said, “By the way, have you heard of Han Huang?”
 Zhao Shuangquan’s eyes lit up. “Heavenly Court’s Han Huang?”
 “That’s right.”
 “Of course, I’ve heard of him. Many people say that he’s almost on the throne of the Eternal Peak. He was born as Freedom and has unparalleled potential. His backing is even more impressive.”
 “Hehe, you have to call him Uncle-Master, understand?”
 “Yes, Uncle-Master Han!”
 Zhao Shuangquan scratched his head and smiled. Because of Su Qi, he had a good impression of the Hidden Sect. In his opinion, the Hidden Sect was a righteous lineage.
 Back then, Su Qi had been plotted against so badly. If it was any other orthodoxy, they could only give him up. Only the Hidden Sect did not.
 Zhao Shuangquan was silent.
 He was proud and arrogant. Although he liked the Hidden Sect, it did not mean that he felt inferior to them.
 Zhao Shuangquan immediately said, “I’ll go! I’ll be a soldier under Uncle-Master Huang!”
 Su Qi immediately smiled. This child couldn’t be provoked.
 “Your Uncle-Master Huang might not agree.”
 Su Qi shook his head and smiled. This was the truth. He usually did not interact with Han Huang. No matter how close they were, they had to be distant.
 Zhao Shuangquan grinned. If Han Huang did not accept him, he naturally would not accept Azure Heaven Mystic.
 It was fine as long as he did not fall behind Azure Heaven Mystic!
 In the Consciousnessless Great Dao World.
 Lao Dan reminded, “Be careful. That fellow invited us here for a reason.”
 Jiang Yi said, “Hmph, we’re the same.”
 The four of them continued forward and arrived in front of a lake. This lake blocked the center of the hall. The surface of the lake was ten thousand feet in diameter and shone brightly. All sorts of transparent fish surged in the water, forming a lively area.
 The four of them stopped by the lake. A figure stood opposite the lake. It was the white-haired figure who had brought them to the Consciousnessless Great Dao World.
 The white-furred figure had already grown his lower body. He looked like a cow or horse with black fur.
 Zhao Xuanyuan shouted, “We’re here. What do you want to do? Just say it.”
 Dao Sovereign and the other three looked at each other.
 The white-furred figure continued, “Other than the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority that belongs to the Chaos, others can also control the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority of the Consciousnessless Great Dao World. The Consciousnessless Great Dao World’s essence is the same as the Chaos, but the Supreme Rules of the Chaos have already been divided. I’m the only one who has touched the Consciousnessless Great Dao World. I can only control one.”
 Jiang Yi frowned. “Drag us into the Chaos with you? Isn’t this making us betray the Dao!”
 The white-haired figure began to tell the four of them about the Heavenly Dao’s past.
 Dao Sovereign glanced at Lao Dan.
 Lao Dan sent a voice transmission, “Indeed. I’ve heard from my master that the Heavenly Dao is a world with rules and order in the Chaos. However, you also understand the current situation. If not for your master’s rise, I’m afraid…”
 Dao Sovereign’s expression darkened.
 The white-furred figure said, “Helping the Consciousnessless Great Dao World is also helping the Heavenly Dao.”
 Zhao Xuanyuan asked, “Who are you?”
 The white-haired figure hesitated for a moment before saying, “I am the first living being in the Consciousnessless Great Dao World. You can call me the Number One Deity.”
 The Number One Deity?
 How arrogant!
 Dao Sovereign and the other three thought to themselves.
 Jiang Yi asked, “How can we believe you? What if you tamper with the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority of the Consciousnessless Great Dao World?”
 The Number One Deity replied, “I no longer have any room to scheme. I only want to survive. If you don’t believe me, one of you can test me first.”
 Dao Sovereign and the other three were silent.
 Zhao Xuanyuan looked at Dao Sovereign and said, “Brother, decide!”
 Jiang Yi said, “We’ll do it together!”
 Lao Dan was speechless and clutched his chest.
 It hurt slightly.
 Dao Sovereign said in a low voice, “Yes! If not for this karma, we have to take a different path and seek great opportunities if we want to seek the Chaos. Besides, we will also be allies of the Heavenly Dao and resist the Chaos together when the Consciousnessless Great Dao World develops. Brothers, don’t forget, we are living beings of the Heavenly Dao and not the Chaos!”
 Zhao Xuanyuan and Jiang Yi smiled firmly.
 A hundred thousand years later.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and saw Han Ling’s beautiful face.
 He glared at her and said angrily, “How dare you to keep staring at your father!”
 Han Ling smiled. “Father.”
 This smile was clearly a coquettish one.
 Han Jue’s dissatisfaction immediately dissipated.
 He asked helplessly, “Tell me, what is it?”
 “I’ve already grasped the treasure you gave me. Shall we spar in the simulation trial?” Han Ling covered her mouth and laughed.
 Han Jue raised his eyebrows.
 This girl was rebellious!
 You want to challenge your father?
 Very good, I’ll let you experience the despair your father’s enemies experienced!


 Han Jue agreed to fight with Han Ling, and the father and daughter entered the simulation trial.
 Han Jue attacked the moment the fighting started.
 Instant kill!
 There was no argument.
 Han Ling suddenly woke up with a stunned expression.
 Han Jue’s expression didn’t change.
 The Daoist temple was silent for a while before Han Ling said aggrievedly, “Father! How can you use your true strength! Even if you do, let me use my full strength first. I mainly want to test the power of this treasure.”
 Han Jue said angrily, “There are so many opponents in the simulation trial. Isn’t it enough for you to try on them? You’re just too daring and want to find trouble with your father.”
 “How can this be?!
 “Hehe.
 “I don’t care. Father, don’t attack first. Let me attack for a while.”
 Han Jue couldn’t stand Han Ling’s coquettishness. He could only agree.
 The second simulation trial began. Han Jue did not attack and let Han Ling use all sorts of methods on him.
 He finally saw how powerful the Emperor Soldiers were.
 Their cultivation was like the main body’s. They were ferocious, but they did not know any Mystical Powers. It was indeed like an army in the mortal world. It was very difficult for anyone of the same realm to stop Han Ling. However, they became useless if there was a difference in cultivation level, no matter how many Emperor Soldiers there were.
 Han Ling couldn’t break through Han Jue’s defense no matter how she attacked.
 In the end, she got tired and gave up.
 The father and daughter opened their eyes. Han Ling sighed. She had suffered a blow.
 Han Jue smiled proudly. “Do you know how powerful your father is? Why don’t you go out and ask around?”
 Han Ling curled his lips. “Is that so? Then tell me your story again. Last time, you talked about attaining the Dao. What happened after that?”
 She was really curious.
 She was already invincible among her peers in the simulation trial. She could still resist even when facing a Great Dao Sage.
 She had overestimated herself and fought with all the existences in the simulation trial, but no one pressured her so much.
 Han Jue immediately started to tell his story.
 He was naturally willing to show off in front of his daughter.
 The story went on for a long time.
 Han Ling sighed after he finished speaking.
 Han Jue’s enemies and situations fascinated her. What would she do if she faced his previous dangers?
 “I cultivated in seclusion so that my enemies can never guess my cultivation level.” Han Jue smiled.
 Han Ling nodded. “I think so too. Father, don’t worry. I’ll never be arrogant.”
 The father and daughter chatted for a while. Han Ling continued cultivating while Han Jue started to check his emails.
 His circle of friends was very lively. His old friends had already grown up and could take charge. Han Jue sighed.
 An email attracted his attention.
 [Your good friend Huang Zuntian established the Great Dao World and his cultivation increased greatly.]
 Great Dao World?
 This was a key to attaining the Dao Creator Realm!
 This fellow was something.
 Han Jue thought for a moment before pulling Huang Zuntian into a dream.
 The dream was the eighteen peaks of the Jade Pure Sacred Sect. The green mountains and rivers were as beautiful as a painting.
 Huang Zuntian’s aura became stronger. He wore a golden-patterned black robe and a purple jade dragon horn blue crown. His robe fluttered in the wind and he had a dignified expression.
 Life Lord!
 Huang Zuntian opened his eyes and saw Han Jue. He asked, “So it’s you. I have an opportunity and was looking for you. Do you want to hear it?”
 Han Jue said, “No.”
 Huang Zuntian immediately knelt down on one knee and cupped his fists. “Greetings, Master!”
 He was excited and did not put on airs at all.
 If not for Han Jue using the name of the Divine Might Heavenly Sage to attract the attention of all living beings in the Chaos, he would not be where he was today.
 With his understanding of Han Jue, he knew that the other party didn’t like to be in the limelight. Wasn’t he so ostentatious in the past millions of years to make all living beings forget them, the Calamity Life Controllers?
 Ever since Han Jue reached the peak of the Chaos, the Ultimate God of Punishment had also looked for him and was willing to give him a chance. This made him even more respectful towards Han Jue.
 He felt that all of this was thanks to Han Jue!
 However, Han Jue didn’t look for him, so he didn’t dare to expose his relationship with him.
 Han Jue said, “Did you create a world in the depths of your soul?”
 Huang Zuntian was stunned. This was his secret. His master actually knew!
 “Yes, Master is really powerful. You can even discover this,” Huang Zuntian replied respectfully with a look of admiration.
 Han Jue said, “Don’t mention this to anyone, including your trusted aides.”
 He told Huang Zuntian the information that the Chaotic Consciousness had told him.
 Huang Zuntian trembled. He didn’t expect there to be a transcendent existence above the Chaos.
 He took a deep breath and said, “Thank you for your reminder, Master. I originally wanted to move the Calamity Life Controllers in. Fortunately, you alerted me… I was almost exposed…”
 An existence who could revive all living beings in the Chaos with a wave of his hand. How terrifying was that!
 Han Jue said, “I believe you will hide well. I have been paying attention to you all these years. You did well and changed the image of Life in the hearts of all living beings. Are you going to participate in the Chaotic Assembly?”
 Han Jue was speechless. “If you have the ability, go and fight for it. You don’t have to give me face. Han Huang is my son, but I also think highly of you. I’ve known you for far longer than my children!”
 Huang Zuntian was touched and knelt down again.
 Han Jue said, “Take good care of Li Daokong and Shi Dudao for me, but don’t say that it’s my intention.” “I understand, Master. Don’t worry!” Huang Zuntian immediately promised.
 The dream shattered.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and sighed.
 Huang Zuntian, what a Huang Zuntian!
 He could actually reach this point by himself!
 Jiang Jueshi’s future was a Dao Creator. Could Huang Zuntian also succeed? Han Jue didn’t use the derivation function. Regardless, Han Jue would help him if Huang Zuntian had the ability.
 He could have as many people as he wanted as long as he was the best!
 Then, Han Jue visited Shi Dudao, Divine Lord Peacock, and Jing Tiangong in the image of the Dark Forbidden Lord. He encouraged them to not be disappointed.
 The Dark Forbidden Lord still had to stay.
 Before absolute invincibility, the Dark Forbidden Lord could help him do many things.
 Han Jue suddenly had an idea.
 Should he visit Zhao Shuangquan and Azure Heaven Mystic in their dreams and nurture them in the image of the Dark Forbidden Lord? In the end, he would ask them to target the Divine Might Heavenly Sage. What would the Dao Creator think?
 Anyway, they couldn’t catch up to Han Jue no matter how strong they were.
 “This method is fine, but I feel that there’s no need…
 “Let’s cultivate. Cultivation is the key.”
 Han Jue shook his head and laughed. Then, he entered his cultivation state.
 Tens of thousands of years later.
 Han Jue passed his eleven-millionth-year birthday, but it didn’t trigger the system’s choice reward. This meant that the choice reward would be triggered every ten million years in the future.


 Han Jue had been in seclusion for five hundred thousand years!
 His cultivation level had increased greatly, and the Ultimate Origin Qi in the Primordial World had also increased.
 Some Chaotic Fiendcelestials that were born very early began to attempt to create living beings in their own galaxies. They all failed, but at least they were trying. He had to use the Great Dao of Creation if he wanted to create living beings.
 The power of the three thousand Great Dao had already been condensed by Han Jue. Only the Chaotic Fiendcelestials needed to discover it themselves.
 Han Jue looked at Han Ling beside him.
 This girl was already very close to the Great Dao. When she broke through, a million Emperor Soldiers would be terrifying.
 The Primordial Emperor Star was very similar to the Primordial Fiendcelestial. The stronger one’s cultivation realm was, the more powerful they were.
 A million Great Dao Sages, ten million Great Dao Supremes… This leap was simply ridiculous.
 Han Jue began to look forward to the next Heaven’s Chosen.
 Wouldn’t it be exciting when he gathered more than a hundred Heaven’s Chosen?
 Han Jue had a feeling that those Dao Creators all had the power to nurture their own forces. The Chaotic Consciousness had the Consciousnessless Great Dao World, and so did the Formless Transcendent Deity and the other two Dao Creators.
 Perhaps there would be a war in the Great Dao World one day!
 Anyway, Han Jue had to prepare for his Primordial World.
 He would take drastic measures and directly move his disciples and descendants into his world when the Primordial World transformed into the Ultimate Origin World and he stepped into the Dao Creator Realm.
 From today onwards, it would be called the Ultimate Origin World. He would change the name in advance.
 Then, he started checking his emails.
 Compared to before, his circle of friends did not change much. However, Dao Sovereign and the other three had obtained many opportunities. They were all related to the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority.
 There were only seven Great Dao Providence Divine Authorities. Could these four guys occupy four?
 Something was wrong.
 Could it be that the Consciousnessless Great Dao World also had the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority?
 It was very likely!
 After all, the essence of the Great Dao World was similar. With the three thousand Great Dao as the foundation, they would create their own rules of order.
 One could obtain the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority with the Supreme Rules.
 Han Jue stood up and walked out of the Daoist temple to visit Xing Hongxuan.
 Xing Hongxuan naturally missed Han Jue after not seeing him for nearly a million years.
 They began to chat after a few years.
 Xing Hongxuan shook her head. “Forget it, it’s meaningless. Besides, Ling’er is like you. She only knows how to cultivate. It’s not bad for me to occasionally use my Sage Sense to observe the universe of stars. Many mortal races have already appeared in this universe. Some planets are even more lively. Liu Bei has done a good job.”
 Han Jue said, “The Chaotic Assembly is happening in a little more than three million years. Do you want to go and see it? Tuo’er, Huang’er, and Qing’er will all participate.”
 Xing Hongxuan’s eyes lit up. “Of course, I’m going. My son is going to be at the Eternal Peak. As his mother, I will definitely support him.”
 “Eternal Peak? Not necessarily.”
 “There are geniuses stronger than him in the Chaos?”
 “He’s indeed the first in terms of potential, but there’s still the matter of opportunities. Let’s see if he can grasp them. I’ll be very glad if he can obtain the Eternal Peak.”
 Han Jue smiled and didn’t say anything else.
 Recently, many people with powerful backgrounds and fortuitous encounters had indeed appeared in the Chaos. He would be disappointed if Han Huang could not suppress these geniuses as a Primordial Fiendcelestial. However, he also felt that it was impossible if Han Huang wanted to win easily. There would definitely be a bitter battle.
 Han Jue said, “In terms of potential, Huangler is naturally stronger.”
 “What about strength? Compared to the same realm.”
 “Hard to say.”
 Xing Hongxuan’s beautiful eyes widened. That gentle Ling’er was so powerful?
 She suddenly thought of something and asked, “Husband, did you do something? You even asked Han Yu and Huang’er to marry to produce offspring. This means that you can control the bloodline of your descendants.”
 Han Jue smiled. “You’re very smart, but you better not be too smart.”
 She was not afraid of Han Jue, but she was afraid that his enemies would use her to obtain information.
 “I have to urge Huang’er. Bring me to see him in a million years.”
 “Sure.”
 Han Jue agreed. Although the Chaos was huge, with his cultivation, he wouldn’t be able to go anywhere for long.
 After chatting for a long time, Han Jue left Xing Hongxuan’s Daoist temple and went to find Qingluan’er and Xuan Qingjun. They interacted for a few more years before he returned to the Daoist temple to continue cultivating
 A hundred thousand years later.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and sent a dream to the Ultimate God of Punishment.
 The Ultimate God of Punishment had sent him a dream request tens of thousands of years ago, but he was busy cultivating and did not accept it.
 This was his rule. He couldn’t visit dreams casually. It had to follow his seclusion cycle.
 In the dream.
 The Ultimate God of Punishment bowed and said, “Master, the Chaotic Assembly is getting closer and closer. The location has yet to be decided.”
 Han Jue said, “What locations have you chosen so far?”
 “One, the Void Domain near the Heavenly Dao and the Three Pure Sacred World.”
 “No, it’s too close.”
 “Two, the bottom of the Chaos. I’ll also make the Resentful Devils act as the geniuses’ whetstones.”
 “Sure.”
 “It’s worth considering.”
 The Ultimate God listed them one by one. Han Jue also began to think.
 If it was before, he would have let the Ultimate God of Punishment choose as he pleased. However, he felt that he should scheme now that the Chaotic Consciousness was in the mix.
 The Ultimate God of Punishment finally said, “We can build a city at the bottom of the Chaos if this location is picked. In the future, all the domains have to build a teleportation formation in this city to facilitate guarding the bottom of the Chaos. I’m still worried about that place.”
 Han Jue said, “Sure, but to the outside world, you have to say that you chose this place, understand?”
 The Ultimate God of Punishment agreed and pondered. Could there be a terrifying existence at the bottom of the Chaos that made the Divine Might Heavenly Sage afraid?
 He continued, “Regarding the rules of the Chaotic Assembly, we have to confirm it. The number of geniuses participating in this event is immeasurable. The first round needs to eliminate a large number of people, but it’s best if there are no huge casualties.”
 Han Jue asked, “Just say it. You must have an idea.”
 The Ultimate God of Punishment smiled and began to state the rules he had in mind.
 After a long while…
 After he finished speaking, Han Jue thought for a moment and said, “The beginning is fine, but the second last stage is a little ridiculous, right?”
 The Ultimate God of Punishment smiled. “We have to let them know that there’s always someone stronger.”


 “Alright, that’s settled. I’ll leave the details to
 you.”
 Han Jue waved his hand. The Ultimate God of Punishment hurriedly agreed.
 The dream ended.
 Han Jue was filled with anticipation.
 The Chaotic Assembly was meaningless to him. It was just for fun.
 After cultivating for ten million years, it was time to be lively. This Chaotic Assembly was definitely the most lively event in history, and it was led by him.
 After thinking, Han Jue began to cultivate.
 ome
 Heavenly Court, in the Desolate Divine Palace.
 Han Huang frowned.
 Su Qi smiled and said, “Junior Huang, you can reject it. It’s fine.”
 Han Yu nodded.
 Han Huang looked at Han Yu again as if he was seeing his father.
 Forget it.
 “Alright, bring the two of them. I will definitely protect them,” Han Huang said.
 Su Qi hurriedly said, “No need. You only need to let them fight. They deserve it if they can’t survive.”
 Han Yu nodded.
 Han Huang was no longer the kid from back then. He still knew the basics of the world. He naturally understood that he had to take good care of them Zhao Shuangquan and Azure Heaven Mystic. They could be injured, but they could not die.
 Su Qi and Han Yu quickly left after settling the matter.
 Han Huang found the Evil Heavenly Emperor and told him about this.
 He didn’t have the time to bring two geniuses around. He had to cultivate in seclusion most of the time and naturally had to leave this matter to the Evil Heavenly Emperor.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor immediately beamed.
 “Zhao Shuangquan, Azure Heaven Mystic. I’ve heard of them. Good news!”
 Han Huang rolled his eyes.
 He reminded him, “These two are the Heavenly Dao’s treasures. They can only follow the Heavenly Court for the time being. Nothing can happen to them, understand?”
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor smiled. “I naturally understand, but I like prodigies. It’s not like you don’t know. Even if they can’t serve me, it’s a good thing to make friends. One more friend means one less potential enemy.”
 Han Huang nodded in agreement.
 In the Consciousnessless Great Dao World, in the endless desert.
 Small springs fell to the ground like water droplets of different sizes. Dao Sovereign and the other three sat at the edge of the small springs, far apart.
 Zhao Xuanyuan looked up and shouted, “Brothers, I’m about to break through a minor realm!”
 Jiang Yi said, “He broke through long ago.”
 Dao Sovereign said, “Cultivation is nothing. I’m about to grasp the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority. This time, the Eternal Peak is mine.”
 Zhao Xuanyuan smiled. “Can you defeat Junior Huang? Also, Junior Tuo is also very strong. He’s one of the Divine Punishers. Now, the Five Great Divine Punishers are genuine Divine Spirit experts.”
 Dao Sovereign raised his eyebrows. “Although that’s the case, are you going to give in? Not to mention the Eternal Peak, if you really give in, I’m afraid even the Chaotic Ten Absolutes won’t be enough. Our Hidden Sect has too many geniuses.”
 Lao Dan rolled his eyes.
 How pretentious.
 He couldn’t help but think of the Three Pure Sacred World.
 Could there be a prodigy in the Three Pure Sacred World?
 Jiang Yi sighed. “Han Tuo, Han Huang, Jiang Jueshi, the Hidden Sect’s personal disciples, and so on. To be honest, there are not enough
 spots.”
 Zhao Xuanyuan asked curiously, “Are the Black Hell Chicken and the others also participating?”
 Jiang Yi said, “I’m not sure. By the way, Sect Master gave birth to another daughter. She’s also an Innate Great Creation. I’m not sure what the ability is. If she also wants to participate…”
 Zhao Xuanyuan said in surprise, “There are only three million years left. It’s too late for her to participate, right?”
 Jiang Yi said, “She’s following Sect Master. This is impossible to predict. Have you forgotten Sect Master’s experience? How strong was he after just a few million years?”
 Zhao Xuanyuan was silent.
 Dao Sovereign was the same.
 Lao Dan couldn’t take it anymore and turned around, not wanting to listen anymore.
 A figure descended at this moment. It was the white-haired figure, the Number One Deity.
 The Number One Deity looked down at the four of them and said, “Four Dao Weapons have appeared in the Consciousnessless Great Dao World. They can perfectly fuse with the power of the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority. Do you want them?”
 Dao Sovereign and the other three immediately looked up.
 Five hundred thousand years later.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and smiled. His cultivation had improved again.
 He directly began the simulation trial and challenged the Nine-Headed Divine Spirit.
 He had secretly copied the latter’s cultivation when the Nine-Headed Divine Spirit attacked the third Dao Field.
 An hour later.
 Han Jue looked regretful.
 What a powerful Nine-Headed Divine Spirit!
 However, Han Jue could finally kill him. Such an expert was actually directly demoted to a mortal by the Ninth Chaos. What a waste.
 Han Jue continued the simulation trial and challenged the Nine-Headed Divine Spirit.
 After dozens of times, he could kill the Nine-Headed Divine Spirit in five minutes.
 Han Jue looked at Han Ling next.
 Sensing his gaze, Han Ling opened her eyes and smiled. “Father, I broke through. I saw Second Brother at the door of the Great Dao. He protected me. Many Great Dao Sages were present, but they all fled with their tails between their legs when they saw him. Second Brother is really powerful!”
 Han Ling was overjoyed at the mention of Han Huang
 “After all, your second brother is already a Great Dao Supreme. He’s also considered top-notch in the Chaos.” Han Jue smiled.
 Han Ling nodded. “Father, let’s spar again? I already have a million Emperor Soldiers!”
 Han Jue immediately agreed upon seeing that she was a little proud. Three breaths later, the battle ended.
 Han Ling was stunned.
 Han Jue said, “A million Emperor Soldiers sound scary, but they don’t know any Mystical Powers in the end. You might be able to unleash greater strength if they can form a formation.”
 Han Ling woke up and asked, “Father, what are the three thousand Dharma Idols you summoned? Could it be the three thousand Chaotic Fiendcelestials?”
 She had also heard that her father was a Chaotic Fiendcelestial, and there were three thousand Chaotic Fiendcelestials.
 Han Jue smiled. “This information can’t be spread to others.”
 Han Ling nodded and started to ponder over his words.
 Han Jue also began to ponder.
 This girl’s cultivation speed was not inferior to Han Huang’s.
 Should he let her participate in the Chaotic Assembly?
 There were still three million years until the Chaotic Assembly. Even if she couldn’t catch up to Han Huang, it was not hopeless to occupy a spot among the Chaotic Ten Absolutes.
 Han Jue asked, “Ling’er, do you want to participate in the Chaotic Assembly?”
 Han Ling hurriedly shook her head. “No!”
 Han Jue was surprised. “Why?”.
 “Won’t I expose my strength? I want to be like you, secretly cultivating so that no one can guess how strong I am!” Han Ling said proudly.
