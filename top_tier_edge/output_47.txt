 “Pangu, no one can save you if you don’t stop!” the Holy Mother of Order said angrily.
 At this moment, mighty figures appeared on her left and right, all glaring at Pangu below.
 “I have already repaid the karma I owed the Great Dao Divine Spirits. However, the Divine Authority Generals are slaughtering the Chaotic Fiendcelestials. I will naturally resist!
 “Today, I, Pangu, will definitely sever the Supreme Rule!
 “This Chaos is not a chessboard for you to act recklessly!
 “The Chaos doesn’t only belong to you. It also belongs to all living beings!”
 Pangu roared angrily and raised his saber with both hands. His muscles tensed up and strong winds surrounded his body. His strength exploded.
 The Great Dao Divine Spirits waved their palms at him. The majestic and huge Pangu also looked tiny in front of them.
  Pangu waved his saber at the sky. Terrifying Dharmic powers erupted like a mountain torrent, scattering the Great Dao Divine Spirits that filled the sky.
 The endless sea of clouds above Han Jue’s head was also slashed into an extremely vast gap, as if the sky was split into two.
 Pangu continued to slash at the cloud wall in front of him. With every strike, his figure suddenly increased in height.
 Han Jue had a strange expression.
 ......
 Pangu and the Holy Mother of Order had a falling out?
 Didn’t they help Pangu previously?
 It seemed to be because the Divine Authority Generals slaughtered the Chaotic Fiendcelestials?
 But didn’t you do this before?
 Han Jue suddenly couldn’t understand which side Pangu was on and why he was acting like this.
 The illusion shattered.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and fell into deep thought.
 He was about to continue using the derivation function when a voice resounded in his mind.
 “Today, I, Pangu, will revive the Chaotic Fiendcelestials I killed. I hope that the Chaotic Fiendcelestials will resist the Divine Authority Generals and no longer be a pawn of the Divine Spirits!
 “Overturn the Great Dao Divine Spirit’s dominance and reestablish the Chaotic Order!
 “The Chaos should be dominated by the Chaotic Fiendcelestials!”
 They could still be revived?
 Even Han Jue’s blood boiled.
 However…
 I’m not a Chaotic Fiendcelestial!
 You called the wrong guy!
 Han Jue smiled. He didn’t expect Pangu to rebel at this time and start a war with the Divine Authority Generals!
 However, it was normal. The Divine Authority Generals should have gone after the Primordial Fiendcelestial, but they targeted the Chaotic Fiendcelestials along the way. As a Chaotic Fiendcelestial, what could Pangu do?
 What method was it to revive the Chaotic Fiendcelestials?
 Han Jue was a little envious.
 [Pangu sent you a dream. Do you accept?]
 Han Jue looked at the notification that suddenly appeared in front of him and couldn’t help but be stunned.
 Why was Pangu’s intention?
 “Is it dangerous for me to accept his dream?”
 [900 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [No]
 Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief and agreed to Pangu’s dream.
 The dream was the illusion that Han Jue had entered previously. There were clouds everywhere.
 Pangu stood in front and looked down at him.
 Han Jue was like a tiny ant in front of him, and Pangu was a mountain, the highest mountain in the legends!
 Pangu said, “Today, I’m not only opening an impossible path for the Chaotic Fiendcelestials, but also for you and the Heavenly Dao.”
 Han Jue showed a frown.
 “The Divine Authority Generals not only kill the Chaotic Fiendcelestials, but also the living beings of the Heavenly Dao. In other words, the Divine Authority Generals will destroy the Heavenly Dao. I need you to protect the Heavenly Dao. It doesn’t matter who is in charge of the Heavenly Dao. The living beings of the Heavenly Dao can live well as long as the Heavenly Dao survives!” Pangu stared at Han Jue with a burning gaze and said in a low voice.
 I see.
 Pangu’s true goal was the Heavenly Dao.
 The entire Heavenly Dao was Pangu’s bloodline. He was fighting for his children and descendants.
 Han Jue said, “I will do my best to protect the Heavenly Dao, but I can only do my best.”
 Pangu smiled. “I’ve been observing you. You always say that it’s only for yourself, but you will stand up every time the Heavenly Dao is in trouble. This is also the reason why I didn’t pursue the matter when you subdued Pan Xin. You have contributed to the Heavenly Dao!”
 Han Jue looked calm but felt awkward inside.
 Actually, he was really doing this for himself!
 At least, he felt that helping the Heavenly Dao was only within his ability.
 “The Divine Authority Generals represent the Supreme Divine Authority. They are the strongest force in the Chaos. You can’t resist even if you see through the illusion. The Divine Authority Generals can erase true existences. The Chaotic Fiendcelestials can’t stop the Divine Authority Generals even if they join forces. I’ll try my best to stop them before they arrive at the Heavenly Dao.
 “Of course, you might not be able to stop it! I hope you’re prepared! The Heavenly Dao lifeforms can’t escape the destruction of the Divine Authority Generals as long as they are in the Chaos!
 “Unite with the Heavenly Dao and fight at any time. You have to try your best even if you die!” Pangu said with a burning gaze. With that said, the dream shattered.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and frowned.
 He asked in his mind, “Is what Pangu said true?”
 [900 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 [It’s true.]
 Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief.
 He suddenly began to admire Pangu. This guy was not as bad as he had imagined.
 This Giant God was still very strong!
 Without the Dao Field, he dared to start a battle against the Divine Authority Generals. He was very firm!
 Although this Pangu was not the true Pangu himself!
 “I wonder how many Fiendcelestials Pangu has revived. If they can stall for time, so be
 it.”
 Han Jue thought silently.
 He suddenly felt that there was hope.
 He was not alone!
 Pangu would still support him if he destroyed ten thousand Divine Authority Generals!
 It was still unknown how strong Pangu’s main body was.
 Han Jue sent a voice transmission to Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du and told him the information Pangu had revealed.
 As for how Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du arranged it, it was none of Han Jue’s business. In any case, the Heavenly Dao couldn’t help when resisting the Divine Authority Generals.
 Han Jue glanced at Red Fate. She had only entered the Primordial Heavenly Prison for twenty thousand years and was still far from being subdued.
 He did not continue cultivating but waited.
 The heavenly might had yet to dissipate!
 Pangu was still brandishing his saber!
 Han Jue didn’t know what Pangu wanted to do. Could severing the Supreme Rule affect the Divine Authority Generals?
 Perhaps.
 Han Jue suddenly remembered that he didn’t understand the Divine Authority Generals.
 Would the Divine Authority Generals be undying in the Great Dao?
  Ten thousand undying Great Dao Sages…
 Han Jue’s heart skipped a beat. Only then did he realize that he had underestimated the Divine Authority Generals.
 He could only place his hopes on Pangu.
 “Brother, work harder. Kill them. Let me harvest their heads in the end…” Han Jue muttered to himself, his eyes filled with anticipation.
 On the other side, the Chaos was already surging!
 All the Great Dao Divine Spirits rushed to the same place.
 The Divine Robe Daoist was also one of them.
 He traveled through the spatial turbulence and frowned.
 “What is Pangu trying to do?”
 The Divine Robe Daoist was puzzled and couldn’t help but slow down. He felt that this trip was very dangerous. It was better to slow down.


 He already felt Pangu’s terrifying aura before he reached his destination.
 His speed slowed down.
 Pangu was not Han Jue who could still give him a way out.
 Compared to Han Jue, Pangu’s reputation was even more ferocious. He had established a terrifying reputation by slaughtering an era!
 The Divine Robe Daoist suddenly wanted to turn around.
 “Why don’t we forget it? It’s been a while. Pangu has yet to be suppressed. I was also cannon fodder in the past.”
 The Divine Robe Daoist thought silently and turned around.
 His body was suddenly destroyed, leaving only a remnant soul. He fled and disappeared into the spatial turbulence.
  After several months, the vast heavenly might vanished, signaling the end of Pangu’s operation.
 He could use his lifespan to calculate, but he felt that there was no need.
 In any case, it did not affect him for the time being.
 ......
 Continue cultivating.
 Han Jue closed his eyes.
 Year after year passed.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du gathered the Sages and explained the Divine Authority Generals’ threat. The Sages were shocked. After some discussion, they decided to call back the Heavenly Dao lifeforms that had gone out.
 However, it was almost impossible to recall them all. They could only try their best.
 They planned to hide this matter to not give the other factions a chance.
 The Divine Authority Generals’ terror had already spread in the Chaos. The Heavenly Dao couldn’t resist such a force and was almost doomed.
 Fortunately, Han Jue still didn’t move, which meant that he was confident. The Sages wouldn’t panic.
 In the blink of an eye.
 A hundred thousand years passed.
 Han Jue opened his eyes. Red Fate had been waiting for a long time.
 Han Jue said, “Go back and bring your world here.”
 Red Fate nodded. She was also waiting for this order.
 Han Jue waved his sleeve and sent her out of the Heavenly Dao.
 Then, he began to check his emails.
 [Your good friend Pangu has severed the karma of the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority. His providence has decreased greatly.]
 (Your good friend Qiu Xilai was cursed by a mysterious curse.]
 (Your good friend Huang Zuntian has received guidance from a mysterious mighty figure. His cultivation has increased greatly.)
 (Your good friend Pangu was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure] x39
 [Your good friend Pangu has perished. His body and soul have been destroyed. His will has returned to his origin.]
 [Your good friend Divine Robe Daoist was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure and was severely injured.]
 [Your disciple Zhou Fan has reached the Freedom Realm. His providence has increased greatly.]
 Pangu had perished, but not really. It was just that this resurrected body had perished.
 The karma of the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority…
 How many types of providence were there?
 Han Jue was very curious.
 Calamity Life Controller was one type, Divine Authority was another. What was karma?
 Han Jue tried to deduce the karma of others, but he could still deduce the karma of all living beings.
 Then, what did he do?
 Han Jue continued reading. Most of the emails were about cultivation breakthroughs and opportunities. There was no information worth thinking about.
 The Chaos had been calm in the past hundred thousand years.
 Apart from Pangu, Han Jue didn’t see a single Chaotic Fiendcelestial.
  He could smell a storm brewing.
 Han Jue’s goal was still cultivation.
 Han Jue thought of a possibility.
 Would the nebulous Primordial Qi form a space when it gathered to the extreme?
 Could this be how the Chaos came about?
 It was possible!
 In the long run, the nebulous Primordial Qi would form a Primordial Space!
 Then, wouldn’t he create the Primordial Chaos?
 Han Jue’s heart beat faster.
 Wouldn’t he be able to turn the Chaos into the Primordial Chaos if he was strong enough and absorbed the entire Chaos into his soul?
 However, there was no benefit in doing this.
 Han Jue didn’t know how the formation of the Primordial Space affected his cultivation.
 He would see in the future!
 Only when facing a worse situation would they miss the peace and maintain it for a long time in the future.
 Everything was going according to plan.
 The Heavenly Dao seemed to be troubled internally and externally, but it wasn’t affected much. Only Han Jue could resist the Divine Authority Generals, and Sages were enough to suppress all living beings in the Heavenly Dao.
 It could not be chaotic!
 Han Jue stood up and went to the 33rd Heaven. Then, he entered the Universal Hall.
 Only Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du was in the Universal Hall.
 Seeing Han Jue appear, he frowned and said, “Fellow Daoist Han, the situation is not
 good.”
 Han Jue said, “Tell me.”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “Pangu died. Although he revived the Chaotic Fiendcelestials, he did not revive the three thousand Chaotic Fiendcelestials. The Chaotic Fiendcelestials are not the Divine Authority Generals’ match. Now, the information about the Divine Authority Generals has already spread in the Chaos. It’s said that the Divine Authority Generals will kill all the Chaotic Fiendcelestials. Some Sages in the Heavenly Dao believe that the reason the Divine Authority Generals are targeting the Heavenly Dao is because of you…”
 He did not continue.
 Han Jue asked, “Then, what do you think?”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said, “I naturally believe you. With your cultivation, you no longer need the Heavenly Dao. However, it’s normal for some Sages to be bewitched. After all, they don’t understand you.”
 Han Jue understood what he meant.
 The new Sages! Regardless of whether it was true or not, Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du wanted to use this opportunity to suppress the new Sages.
 Han Jue asked, “Who do you suspect?”
 “Jin Shen, Xu Dudao, Yang Che, and Primordial Chaos Buddha. They have been interacting with other worlds more frequently recently,” Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du said in a low voice.
 Han Jue remained silent.
 Although the Primordial Chaos Buddha was Han Jue’s spy, this fellow could adjust his impression of others. He might not be trustworthy.
 “I understand. Continue to stabilize the Heavenly Dao. If anyone wants to leave, there’s no need to stop them. It’s just nice to make room for them. However, you should know what to do if someone uses this as an excuse to disturb the Heavenly Dao,” Han Jue said expressionlessly.
 The strongest Sages of the Heavenly Dao were all under his control. How could the new Sages cause trouble? Courting death!
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du nodded.
  He hesitated for a moment and asked, “Fellow Daoist Han, what are your plans for the ten thousand Divine Authority Generals?”
 Han Jue looked at him deeply and said, “There’s still time. Don’t panic.”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du nodded. He hesitated for a moment and said, “Do you need me to find Teacher?”
 Laozi!
 Han Jue smiled faintly. “He won’t help for nothing, right?”
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du hurriedly said, “I’m just asking, just in case. If Fellow Daoist Han is confident, there’s naturally no need to look for him.”
 “Don’t look for anyone for the time being.”
 “Understood.”
Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎 The two of them chatted for a while before Han Jue left.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du heaved a sigh of relief. He was afraid that he had said the wrong thing just now. He had no choice. He didn’t know where Han Jue’s confidence came from. In any case, in his opinion, ten thousand Great Dao Sages were an invincible force. Laozi might not be useful even if he came to help. He would save the Human School at most.


 Han Jue was deep in thought after returning to the Daoist temple.
 He ignored the pressure that the ten thousand Divine Authority Generals exerted on the others. Even he felt great pressure, let alone the others.
 “That’s good, too. I have to test the Sages through an ordeal.”
 Han Jue thought silently. His main goal was still to break through.
 Only by breaking through as soon as possible would he be more confident in dealing with the ten thousand Divine Authority Generals.
 As for Sages, it was fine even if they ran. He could appoint new ones.
 It had been 700,000 years since his last breakthrough
 Time passed extremely quickly for Han Jue, but several eras had passed for all living beings.
  The Immortal World even had many heroic mighty figures and geniuses.
 The personal disciples gathered in the Myriad Worlds Projection.
 They would gather and be organized by the Black Hell Chicken every once in a while.
 Although the Black Hell Chicken had never gone out to train, it had a high status among the personal disciples.
 Everyone gathered and discussed the Divine Authority Generals.
 “Ten thousand Great Dao Sages? That’s too exaggerated. How can our Heavenly Dao stop them?”
 “Yes, the news has already spread. Many Heavenly Dao lifeforms are thinking of a way to escape the providence of the Heavenly Dao.”
 “This will be the greatest calamity in the history of the Heavenly Dao.”
 “What should we do?”
 “I’m not sure. Master didn’t say anything.”
 “Don’t worry. Master would have run away long ago if he was afraid.”
 “It’s mainly because we can’t escape. It’s said that wherever the Divine Authority Generals have been, they will instantly appear in front of him if an unmonitored living being appears!”
 Everyone discussed.
 Li Xuan’ao snorted. “Speaking of which, there have been some objections in the Heavenly Dao recently. Some people even deliberately led the rumors to the Sect Master, saying that the Divine Authority Generals are not targeting the Heavenly Dao, but the Chaotic Fiendcelestials.”
 Su Qi snorted. “I also heard that some Sages are unruly and talked nonsense during the lecture.”
 Dao Sovereign blinked. “Have these Sages gone mad? Do they really think they’re undying?”
 Although Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du had instructed the Sages to suppress the news of the Divine Authority Generals targeting the Heavenly Dao, this matter was too huge. Some Sages couldn’t help but tell their disciples. Gradually, the news spread among the circles above the Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm.
 “How ridiculous. If not for our Sect Master, the Heavenly Dao would have long perished. What, have they forgotten their roots now?” Jiang Yi said disdainfully.
 The Black Hell Chicken looked at Li Daokong and asked, “First Guardian, why aren’t you saying anything? How’s Life’s forces recently?”
 Li Daokong shook his head. “We’re struggling at death’s door and hiding everywhere. However, the appearance of the Divine Authority Generals has indeed relieved the pressure on Life.”
 Li Xuan’ao suggested, “Everyone, why don’t you all return? Just in case, gather all the forces of the Hidden Sect and resist the Divine Authority Generals together.”
 The other disciples nodded.
 Zhou Fan and Chu Shiren also nodded. Letting their forces face the Divine Authority Generals was also a dead end.
 They were also Heavenly Dao lifeforms!
 They believed that Han Jue was not lying. The Divine Authority Generals wanted to target the Chaotic Fiendcelestials and the Heavenly Dao lifeforms.
 The Three Pure Sacred World was in multicolored light. Layers of continents overlapped and their light illuminated the void.
 Yang Che flew over and directly entered the Three Pure Sacred World. He flew into the highest continent and entered a bright world.
 As he advanced, he quickly arrived in front of a huge palace. In front of the hall stood two majestic statues. They were vivid and their eyes were bright.
  The door opened and Yang Che entered the hall. He was a little excited.
 Outside the 33rd Heaven, Qiu Xilai was meditating and cultivating in his Dao Field.
 A figure suddenly appeared in front of him. It was Jie Yin.
 Qiu Xilai opened his eyes and frowned.
 Jie Yin said expressionlessly, “The Divine Authority Generals are unstoppable. Are you willing to return to the Western Sect?”
 Qiu Xilai was silent.
 Jie Yin said, “Every Divine Authority General is an invincible existence that can dominate the Great Dao Sages. You should understand what ten thousand Divine Authority Generals mean. This is the supreme power of the Chaos. Exterminating the Fiendcelestials and the Heavenly Dao is an irreversible trend. You will only die if you continue to stay in the Heavenly Dao. “Some of the Heavenly Dao Sages are already looking for a way out. The reason why I’m looking for you is because of old times.”
 Qiu Xilai asked, “You are also from the Heavenly Dao. How can you be sure that you are not the Divine Authority Generals’ target?”
 This time, it was Jie Yin’s turn to be silent.
 Qiu Xilai was not in a hurry. He waited patiently.
 Jie Yin said faintly, “The Deity Realm of the Ruins of End has long severed the providence of the Heavenly Dao. We are naturally not Heavenly Dao living beings. I don’t know why you are so loyal to the Heavenly Dao and Han Jue. Come and find me at any time after you have thought it through.
 “The Divine Authority Generals are already approaching. You don’t have much time left.”
 With that, Jie Yin dissipated like smoke.
 Qiu Xilai was expressionless, but he snorted in his heart.
 The current him was loyal to Han Jue. How could he be swayed?
 “I want to see which Sages want to leave…”
 Qiu Xilai’s eyes flickered. He decided to contribute to Han Jue.
 He didn’t have to trouble his master for some matters.
 He immediately stood up and went to visit the other Sages.
 …
 In the pavilion by the lake.
 “What? You want to return to the Heavenly Dao! Are you crazy?!” Lao Dan cursed angrily, looking disappointed.
 Dao Sovereign said firmly, “The Heavenly Dao is in trouble. The Hidden Sect disciples naturally have to return!”
 Zhao Xuanyuan and Jiang Yi nodded. Although they had left the Heavenly Dao for a long time, they would never forget their identities.
 Lao Dan suppressed his anger and said, “Ten thousand Divine Authority Generals want to destroy the Heavenly Dao and slaughter the Chaotic Fiendcelestials. You will die if you return. You have achieved freedom and can indeed be considered a mighty figure, but you are nothing in front of ten thousand Divine Authority Generals. Even my main body is not their match!”
 Dao Sovereign, Zhao Xuanyuan, and Jiang Yi were silent, but their eyes were still firm.
 They were never afraid of death!
 After a long while…
 “I want to see how strong a Divine Authority General is!” Jiang Yi snorted.
 Lao Dan’s expression changed.
 Zhao Xuanyuan cursed, “Old man, don’t tell me you don’t want to let us go?”
 The three of them chuckled and the atmosphere instantly became cheerful.
 Zhao Xuanyuan began to brag about Han Jue.
 At the same time, the Great Dao Tower and the Buddhist World were also advancing towards the Heavenly Dao.
 Han Jue didn’t know what the disciples were doing. He was still cultivating in seclusion.
 Another fifty thousand years passed.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and looked expectant.
 His Dharmic powers had improved again! He began the simulation trial and challenged ten thousand Foolish Sword Sages.


 Han Jue opened his eyes and smiled after dozens of simulation trials.
 It was very easy to fight ten thousand Foolish Sword Sages now, but it was not enough to insta-kill them.
 He wanted to insta-kill ten thousand Foolish Sword Sages. Han Jue stretched lazily and started to check his emails.
 (1 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [About two million years.]
 It was not long, but it was not short either.
  Han Jue thought for a moment and decided to tell his disciples about this, in case they encountered the Divine Authority Generals in advance and were eliminated.
 He looked at the Chaos and discovered that his disciples were all rushing towards the Heavenly Dao. The Buddhist World, the Great Dao Tower, and even the entire world were moving. The scene was quite shocking.
 He counted with his fingers and deduced that the disciples had agreed to meet.
 He smiled and muttered, “It makes me very relieved.”
 At the same time, this proved how terrifying the Divine Authority Generals were. Even the disciples who had always liked to be reckless began to return.
 Thinking of this, Han Jue took out the Book of Misfortune and tried to curse the Divine Authority Generals to stall for time.
 However, his curse could not find them.
 It was as if the Divine Authority Generals did not exist in the Chaos. It was useless even if Han Jue recalled their images in his mind.
 Han Jue asked in his mind, “Do I have a chance of winning against the Divine Authority Generals now?”
 (1 quadrillion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 (No]
 So absolute?
 Han Jue’s heart skipped a beat.
 No!
 He had to hurry up and attain the Supreme Realm as soon as possible. Otherwise, he would be unable to defeat the Divine Authority Generals.
 There were still two million years. He should be able to break through before the battle unless something happened.
 He was afraid that something would happen!
 Han Jue observed the Heavenly Dao. After confirming that there was no chaos, he continued cultivating.
 The Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial’s voice suddenly sounded in Han Jue’s mind and was ignored.
 You guys can fight first!
 In the Grand Primordium Domain.
 The Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial looked around at the Chaotic Fiendcelestials in the hall and frowned.
 The Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial had always minded Han Jue. He felt that this fellow was lying about the Devil Ancestor and Han Tuo.
 The Foolish Sword Sage also came. Every Chaotic Fiendcelestial had a solemn expression.
 They knew what they were about to face!
 The Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial said in a low voice, “Everyone, you should already know what Pangu has done for us. We have nowhere to escape and can only fight! Previously, I didn’t disappear. I only went into seclusion. I already know the Divine Authority Generals’ true goal, so I entered seclusion!
 “The Divine Authority Generals are not looking for the Primordial Fiendcelestial, but to eliminate it. If we are slaughtered, the Primordial Fiendcelestial will easily be discovered once it shows its potential. The Primordial Fiendcelestial won’t be able to grow without our providence.
 With that said, all the Chaotic Fiendcelestials spoke one after another, all unwilling.
 The Foolish Sword Sage said, “I didn’t expect the Divine Authority Generals to actually want to deal with us. It might be related to our strength. We threaten the Great Dao Divine Spirits’ status and dominance even without the Primordial Fiendcelestial.
  “Kill! Why don’t we join forces instead of being eliminated one by one!”
 As a Chaotic Fiendcelestial who had survived fighting Pangu alone, the Foolish Sword Sage had a lot of say now.
 A Chaotic Fiendcelestial asked, “But can we really stop the Divine Authority Generals alone? I didn’t say that we won’t fight, but there’s still time. We can prepare more.”
 In the vast Chaos, the Divine Authority Generals were still monitoring from the depths of the Chaos. They were not directly targeting the Chaotic Fiendcelestials.
 The Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial said, “Pangu can still revive. In addition, he has already gathered the twelve Ancestral Magi to help. Although the Ancestral Magi are not very strong, they are still a force.”
 Pangu could revive!
 The Chaotic Fiendcelestials trembled!
 Pangu’s strength was unquestionable. He had fought dozens of Fiendcelestials alone!
 The Chaotic Fiendcelestials suggested one after another. They gathered all the forces they could and prepared to start an unprecedented battle!
 The more they spoke, the more excited they became.
 They even wanted to rope in the Devil Ancestor!
 The Grand Primordium Fiendcelestial laughed. “Very good, let the Divine Spirits see who’s in charge of the current Chaos!”
 Perhaps this battle was not only a life-and-death battle but also a battle that changed the situation of the Chaos!
 The Fiendcelestials were not hopeless. After all, some of them had the cultivation of a Great Dao Supreme. They were more than enough to fight dozens of Great Dao Sages alone.
 Heavenly Dao.
 In the Divine Palace Hall, a quiet hall suddenly shook and the door opened.
 Qin Ling slowly walked out. A golden dragon wrapped around his body and the shadow of a huge halberd could be vaguely seen.
 He looked up at the sky, his eyes shooting out golden light that pierced through the clouds.
 “Buddhist Sect, it’s time to repay the blood debt!”
 Qin Ling smiled sinisterly.
 At this moment, the geniuses of the Divine Palace rushed over. Although the Divine Palace was a major force, it did not have many Pseudo-Sages. Every new one was worthy of the Divine Palace’s congratulations.
 Zhang Guxing also came. He was naturally not in his main body, it was just a Dharma idol.
 Qin Ling cupped his hands at him.
 Zhang Guxing stopped in front of him and said in a low voice, “Why aren’t you restraining your aura?”
 Qin Ling replied, “I’m declaring war!”
 “You… are still stubborn?”
 “Sage, please allow me to be stubborn!”
 Zhang Guxing trembled in anger when he heard that, but he was relieved inside.
 It was good to end the calamity as soon as possible. The Heavenly Dao needed to unite its spirit and prepare for the calamity.
 At the same time, outside the 33rd Heaven.
 In Fang Liang’s Dao Field, Dao Sovereign, Zhao Xuanyuan, Jiang Yi, Ji Xianshen, and Su Qi gathered.
  Fang Liang did not hide anything and told him about the plan of the Immeasurable Calamity.
 Zhao Xuanyuan clicked his tongue in wonder. “You guys really know how to play!”
 Dao Sovereign thought of the previous Immeasurable Calamity and sighed. “No matter how the Heavenly Dao develops, it’s still a Sage playing chess. Fortunately, we’ve already jumped out of the chessboard. Qin Ling is also taken care of by the Hidden Sect.”
 Su Qi nodded in agreement.
 He had been played the worst in the previous calamity. He couldn’t help but sigh even now.
 Jiang Yi said, “By the way, did Sect Master say anything? We can’t enter the Heavenly Dao now.”
 Fang Liang said, “No, but this is the best explanation.”
 The others felt that it made sense and nodded.
 Han Jue would definitely lead them to escape if he was afraid.
 If he did not say anything, that meant that he wanted to fight!


 Fifty thousand years passed.
 Han Jue opened his eyes. The countless stars in his eyes shone as if they contained two vast worlds.
 At this moment, the 10.8 decillion stars in the Primordial World had all turned blue-purple. They flickered with a psychedelic light in the Primordial World filled with purple mist.
 After hundreds of thousands of years of cultivation, these 10.8 decillion stars had already transformed nine times. They had reached the limit and could no longer transform!
 Every star contained endless powerful Dharmic powers.
 Next, Han Jue had to think about how to transform his body and soul together and truly step into the Supreme Realm!
 He frowned.
 Next, he would fuse the Great Dao of Extreme Origin into the 10.8 decillion stars and try again. The Great Dao Supreme was still the Great Dao, after all. It was probably closely related to the Great Dao. He would be able to escape the Great Dao as long as he surpassed the Great Dao Supreme and reached the level of a Dao Creator. At least, the Great Dao would no longer be that important.
 Han Jue checked the emails, wanting to see the situation in the Chaos over the years.
  (Your good friend Daoist Destiny was cursed by a mysterious curse.]
 [Your good friend Heavenly Lord of Primordial Beginning was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure.]
 [Your good friend Pangu has revived.]
 (Your good friend Huang Zuntian has obtained the Great Dao Providence Divine Authority inheritance.)
 [Your son Han Tuo has grasped a Divine Authority Mystical Power.]
 (Your good friend Yi Tian has grasped a Divine Authority Mystical Power.]
 [Your good friend Divine Robe Daoist encountered a dream from a mysterious mighty figure. His soul was damaged.]
 Han Jue was not surprised by Pangu’s revival. He even felt that it was natural.
 However, Huang Zuntian surprised him.
 This fellow was really capable!
 Han Tuo and Yi Tian had been suppressed for so many years and were not dead. Instead, they had learned a Mystical Power. It was reasonable.
 From the looks of it, the leader of the Divine Spirits might have other intentions towards them.
 After reading the emails, Han Jue observed the Heavenly Dao and discovered that Dao Sovereign and the others had already arrived outside the 33rd Heaven and were waiting. Because the Immortal World did not allow Sages to enter, they could not directly return to the Hundred Peak Immortal River.
 Lao Dan also came and stayed in the Universal Hall.
 Meanwhile, the calamity had already erupted in the Immortal World!
 Qin Ling and Xia Zhizun led countless cultivators to fight against the Buddhist Sect. Many providence sects went to reinforce the Buddhist Sect. The battle became more and more grand, affecting more and more races and cultivation forces.
 Han Jue lost interest after watching for a while.
 Perhaps it was because he had planned the calamity that it had lost its novelty.
 Then, Han Jue started to visit the Divine Robe Daoist in his dreams.
 In the dream.
 The Divine Robe Daoist opened his eyes. After seeing Han Jue, he hurriedly knelt down and bowed.
 Han Jue asked him about his recent encounter. The Divine Robe Daoist didn’t hide anything and told him everything.
 Previously, the leader of the Divine Spirits had gathered all the Great Dao Divine Spirits to kill Pangu. He did not go and offended the leader of the Divine Spirits. After that, he was punished in a dream. Of course, it was only a punishment.
 The leader of the Divine Spirits warned the Divine Robe Daoist not to disobey their authority.
 The Divine Robe Daoist smiled bitterly. “Of course, it can even be said to be the strongest existence in the entire Chaos. At first, the Great Dao Divine Spirits were not Pangu’s match at all. The leader of the Divine Spirits had no choice but to personally kill him. In other words, Pangu died in the hands of the leader of the Divine Spirits.
 “Speaking of him, he’s very mysterious. We Great Dao Divine Spirits have never seen his true body. It’s said that there’s an existence of a Chaotic Deity above him, but we’ve only heard it from him. I guess there’s no Chaotic Deity at all. He’s the true ruler of the Chaos.”
 Han Jue’s expression didn’t change, but he was even more curious about the leader of the Divine Spirits.
  This fellow had actually been hiding his identity?
 Not bad!
 The Divine Robe Daoist said, “By the way, the leader of the Divine Spirits also gave us a mission to find the Dark Forbidden Lord and the Curse Fiendcelestial. However, the Curse Fiendcelestial is already dead. I didn’t reveal this to him.”
 Looking for the Dark Forbidden Lord at this juncture?
 How daring!
 It seemed that the leader of the Divine Spirits was confident in the ten thousand Divine Authority Generals and believed that the Chaotic Fiendcelestials would definitely lose. Therefore, he had already begun to deploy troops to find the next existence that could harm the Chaos.
 The Divine Robe Daoist hesitated.
 Han Jue said, “Tell me what’s on your mind!”

 Han Jue was not surprised.
 The Curse Fiendcelestial had probably hidden his identity as the Dark Forbidden Lord to protect itself. Otherwise, it would have been revealed long ago.
 Perhaps the Curse Fiendcelestial knew many things.
 Unfortunately, he died too early. Otherwise, he could still use it.
 The Divine Robe Daoist continued, “His Curse Great Dao is still in my hands. I have a way to revive him. If you need it, I can...”
 Han Jue narrowed his eyes. “Let’s talk about it in the future. The Chaos is chaotic now. I’ll consider reviving the Curse Fiendcelestial after everything calms down.”
 “Alright!” The Divine Robe Daoist agreed.
 Han Jue instructed him and then ended the dream.
 Inside the Daoist temple.
 He sat on the 36th-grade Reincarnation World Destruction Black Lotus and asked in his mind, “I want to know the cultivation level of the leader of the Divine Spirits.”
 (You don’t know the true name and have no karma. Can’t deduce it.)
 Han Jue was stunned.
 He suddenly understood how the enemy felt when facing the Dark Forbidden Lord.
 “Then, How strong is the strongest Great Dao Divine Spirit?”
 (You don’t know the true name and have no karma. Can’t deduce it.]
 Han Jue showed a frown.
 This was not easy to do.
 It was not easy to fight without understanding the enemy’s cultivation.
 Han Jue tried other ways to ask but still couldn’t succeed. He could only give up.
 Shaking his head, Han Jue started cultivating.
 He seeped the Great Dao of Extreme Origin into the 10.8 decillion stars and fused them with his body. Soon, he was immersed in a strange state.
  In the crimson sky, the endless sea rippled. At the end of the sea stood a majestic figure. It was the Holy Mother of Order.
 At this moment, a figure stood on the Holy Mother of Order’s shoulder. His body was surrounded by divine light. His figure sometimes looked like a human and sometimes like a dragon. He was ever-changing, and it was difficult to tell his true appearance.
 The Holy Mother of Order said, “Pangu has revived.”
 The divine light figure said calmly, “I know. But he has severed the karma of Divine Authority. We Great Dao Divine Spirits can’t spy on the Chaos and can only hand everything over to the Divine Authority Generals.”
 “Can the Divine Authority Generals really kill all the Chaotic Fiendcelestials?”
 “Of course. The Divine Authority Generals are the supreme power of the Chaos. They are unstoppable. It’s useless even if Pangu revives.”
 “There’s no chance of defeat?”
 “Unless the Primordial Fiendcelestial appears. But the Primordial Fiendcelestial has to be at least at the Great Dao Supreme cultivation level. The current Chaos doesn’t have three thousand Chaotic Fiendcelestials. It’s impossible for Pangu to transform into a Primordial Fiendcelestial. Not in the past, and definitely not now.”
 “Primordial Fiendcelestial...”
 The Holy Mother of Order’s tone became intriguing
