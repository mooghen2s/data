 Han Jue could feel how strong his curse was. Ordinary Sages probably didn‚Äôt even have the right to deduct his lifespan.
 This feeling of doing whatever he wanted was too satisfying!
 It was as if this book could kill all enemies in the world!
 10 billion years!
 100 billion years!
 A trillion years!
  100 trillion years!
 1 quadrillion years!
 10 quadrillion years!
 Han Jue finally saw an email.
 [Because of your curse, the Dao heart of your enemy, the First Life Black Sovereign, was damaged.]
 Interesting
 Very tough.
 Han Jue put down the Book of Misfortune and didn‚Äôt continue cursing.
 It was still useful to keep the First Life Black Sovereign alive. The Life faction could help him attract attention. It wasn‚Äôt good to kill him early.
 Of course, he might not be able to kill the First Life Black Sovereign if he continued cursing
 Han Jue put away the Book of Misfortune and started the simulation trial.
 Forty-nine years later.
 Han Jue ended the simulation trial and called Dao Comprehension Sword into the Daoist temple.
 Dao Comprehension Sword sighed as she walked into the Daoist temple again.
 Everything was still the same, but her heart was no longer the same. What would have happened if she didn‚Äôt go out everywhere?
 Dao Comprehension Sword didn‚Äôt dare to think about it. Compared to the past, the greatest change was the distance between her and Han Jue.
 In the past, she had little knowledge and didn‚Äôt have so much reverence. Now that she had been in the mortal world, she developed reverence and couldn‚Äôt talk to Han Jue like before.
 Dao Comprehension Sword knelt down respectfully.
 Han Jue said, ‚ÄúHave you made up your mind?‚Äù
 It wasn‚Äôt difficult to guess Dao Comprehension Sword‚Äôs intentions.
 She probably knew why Li Yao, Murong Qi, and the others had disappeared.
 Dao Comprehension Sword looked up and said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm ready. Master, please fulfill my wish.‚Äù
 Han Jue didn‚Äôt say anything else. He directly destroyed her body and placed her soul into the Primordial World.
 Before Dao Comprehension Sword could react, she discovered that her surroundings had changed. Her body was gone.
 ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on‚Ä¶ Why does Master want to kill me?‚Äù
Th√™ sourcùó≤ of this content n/o/v/(ùíÜl)bi((n)) Dao Comprehension Sword was filled with despair and disbelief.
 She listened to the Black Hell Chicken and prepared to offer herself, but she actually angered Han Jue.
 Forget it.
 So be it if she died‚Ä¶
 Anyway, her life was given to her by him.
 Han Jue didn‚Äôt know what Dao Comprehension Sword was thinking. He chose one of the Fiendcelestial Qi and helped her fuse with it.
 Then, he came to the second Dao Field and let Yang Du out.
 Yang Du landed in front of the Daoist temple as if a lifetime had passed.
 He was already an acquaintance of the second Dao Field, so Han Jue didn‚Äôt inform Murong Qi to fetch him.
 Yang Du was very excited. He turned around and bowed to the Daoist temple before leaving with Murong Qi.
 No wonder Han Jue chose Murong Qi to be the leader of the Fiendcelestial Army!
 His bearing was indeed impressive.
 Han Jue didn‚Äôt leave the second Dao Field immediately but looked at the Earth Immortal World.
  He suddenly discovered that Ren Gang and Yin Hongchen were no longer in the Earth Immortal World or even the Heavenly Dao.
 He counted with his fingers. The two of them had followed the Reincarnation Space into the Chaos tens of thousands of years ago and had never returned.
 ‚ÄúWhat are you looking at?‚Äù Li Yao asked curiously.
 Han Jue came back to his senses and smiled. ‚ÄúNothing.‚Äù
 Li Yao suddenly pressed his hand down and said softly, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be in a hurry to leave.‚Äù
 Han Jue asked, ‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù
 Li Yao blushed. ‚ÄúI need your help to increase my cultivation.‚Äù
 Han Jue remained silent.
 Seeing that he did not object, Li Yao immediately started taking action.
 The Daoist temple was immersed in love. Unless one was the Great Dao Supreme, they could not be spied on.
 Time passed.
 Another hundred years passed.
 Han Jue slowly opened his eyes. After messing with Li Yao for twenty years, he returned to continue cultivating.
 Ten thousand years had passed, but his cultivation level had not increased much, making him quite regretful. The cultivation difficulty increased again after he had reached the mid-stage Great Dao Primordial Chaos Realm.
 Han Jue took out the Heaven-Opening Axe. It had been successfully upgraded.
 A terrifying killing intent erupted, fluttering Han Jue‚Äôs long hair. It shocked him so much that he immediately suppressed this killing intent, afraid that he would accidentally injure the Hidden Sect disciples.
 So powerful!
 In his opinion, the previous Heaven-Opening Axe was not even a Chaotic Supreme Treasure. It was just hard and heavy enough.
 The current Heaven-Opening Axe made him, a Great Dao Sage, feel heavy. The killing intent it contained was extremely shocking.
 Even without using the Primordial Divine Rage, he was confident that he could kill Hatred Concubine with just a swing of this –∞—Ö–µ.
 Han Jue checked the Heaven-Opening Axe‚Äôs information.
 [Heaven-Opening Axe: Ultimate Dao Treasure, one of the Birth Dharma treasures of the Chaotic Fiendcelestial Pangu. Number one killing weapon. It has the power to devour the providence of the Chaotic Fiendcelestials and can split the world.)
 Ultimate Dao Treasure!
 Number one killing weapon!
 How arrogant!
 Han Jue put away the Heaven-Opening Axe and entered the simulation trial. He wanted to test its power right away.
 In the Dark Forbidden Zone, the light formed by the Chaotic Heavenly Road split the darkness into two. High above, a majestic palace floated.
 In the hall, Pan Xin was meditating.
 Usually, when he had nothing to do, he liked to cultivate in the Chaos and protect the Chaotic Heavenly Road.
 He suddenly opened his eyes and took out the Heaven-Opening Axe. The Heaven-Opening Axe in his hand petrified at a speed visible to the naked eye, causing cracks to appear.
 Shocked, Pan Xin hurriedly used his Dharmic powers to repair it, but to no avail.
 Boom
 The Heaven-Opening Axe turned to dust and dissipated in front of him.
 ‚ÄúHow can this be?!‚Äù
 Pan Xin was dumbfounded.
 This was a Supreme Treasure passed down to him by Giant God Pangu. Back then, he had relied on this treasure and the Chaotic Green Lotus to kill his way in and out of a group of Great Dao Sages. He had been as impressive as he could be.
 How could such a Supreme Treasure turn to dust?
 Pan Xin pinched his fingers to deduce. He couldn‚Äôt deduce where the Heaven-Opening Axe was or why it was shattered.
 Pan Xin was depressed.
  His Dao heart also cracked.
 At this moment, Emperor Xiao‚Äôs voice came from outside the Daoist temple, ‚ÄúFellow Daoist Pan, recently, a force has appeared near the Chaotic Heavenly Road.‚Äù
 Pan Xin suddenly stood up. His terrifying aura directly shattered his Dao Field. Wisps of flames wrapped around his body.
 Outside the hall, Emperor Xiao was shocked and subconsciously retreated.
 Seeing the murderous Pan Xin, he became even more nervous.
 He suddenly recalled the scene when Pan Xin killed his way back to the Heavenly Dao.
 Had this fellow gone mad?
 ‚ÄúVery good! Life, right? I‚Äôll go meet them now!‚Äù Pan Xin shouted in a low voice. His voice was like thunder. With that said, he disappeared, leaving Emperor Xiao bewildered.


 Damn it!
 How satisfying!
 With the Primordial Divine Rage and the Ultimate Dao Treasure, the Heaven-Opening Axe, he was simply unstoppable!
 Han Jue challenged everyone in the simulation trial alone!
 Even the powerful Foolish Sword Sage could not withstand a single blow from him!
 Especially when he fused with the power of 849 Fiendcelestials and used the Heaven-Opening Axe to execute the Primordial Divine Rage, he was simply invincible.
  Han Jue was arrogant now.
 He even felt that he could fight against a Great Dao Supreme!
 No!
 He had to calm down. If this continued, his Dao heart would be unstable.
 Han Jue entered the simulation trial again and challenged a hundred Foolish Sword Sages alone.
 An hour later, he opened his eyes.
 This time, he calmed down.
 In his opinion, true invincibility in the same realm was that no matter how many enemies came, he could easily kill them.
 The number of enemies was not the factor that affected invincibility.
 He wouldn‚Äôt be invincible if he couldn‚Äôt defeat all enemies at the same level!
 Han Jue started to check his emails to divert his attention.
 (Your disciple Dao Sovereign was attacked by a mysterious Dao Devil) x890002324
 (Your disciple Zhao Xuanyuan was attacked by a mysterious Dao Devil) x698310283
 [Your good friend Jiang Yi was attacked by a mysterious Dao Devil) x699043221
 [Your enemy, the Curse Fiendcelestial, was attacked by your good friend Divine Lord Peacock and was severely injured.]
 [Your son Han Tuo was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure and was severely injured.)
 (Your grand-disciple Chu Shiren established the Great Dao of Creation Buddha and obtained the Primordial Chaos Dao Fruit. His providence has increased greatly.]
 (Your good friend Divine Robe Daoist was attacked by a mysterious mighty figure.]
 (Your disciple Yang Tiandong received a lecture from your disciple Su Qi. His cultivation has increased greatly.)
 He calmed down after seeing the emails!
 The three useless things had been beaten for hundreds of thousands of years. Most importantly, they had yet to successfully attain the Dao.
 It was unknown what they wanted.
 Chu Shiren even overtook them and became a Sage.
 However, how could he create a Great Dao?
 It was the Great Dao of Buddha. Could Jie Yin not sense it?
 Or was Jie Yin not the Great Dao of Buddha?
 Han Jue was interested in Chu Shiren. He was the first existence in his sect to create a Great Dao. He was really impressive.
 ‚ÄúWill my disciples have the highest achievements in the future?‚Äù Han Jue thought silently.
 When he thought of how Chu Shiren had attained the Great Dao and was persuading people to give up cultivating‚Ä¶
 If this kid was invincible, even his Grandmaster might be persuaded to give up cultivating.
 Han Jue was terrified just thinking about it.
  No!
 He couldn‚Äôt let Chu Shiren catch up. There was something wrong with this kid‚Äôs mind.
 He continued reading the emails.
 It became more and more exciting.
 The Heavenly Court seemed to have been very active recently. Even Zhou Fan was fighting everywhere.
 Coincidentally, Han Jue was resting and reading the emails, so he jumped to the 33rd Heaven and entered the Universal Hall.
 He entered directly. The Dao Field array formation was useless in front of him.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du was already used to his rudeness and did not feel that it was inappropriate.
 Soon, the other Sages arrived.
 South Extreme Heavenly Venerate, Sect Master Tian Jue, Heavenly Venerate Wufa, Qiu Xilai, Fang Liang, Huang Zuntian, Jin Shen, Xu Dudao, Su Qi, Li Taigu, Primordial Chaos Buddha, Zhang Guxing, and Long Hao. Long Hao was very excited to see Han Jue and immediately knelt down.
 Primordial Chaos Buddha was very restrained. He was still a spy and could not let Qiu Xilai notice anything. Zhang Guxing felt as if a lifetime had passed when he saw Han Jue.
 He already knew why he could attain the Dao. Indeed, the Divine Palace had developed extremely well and was very attractive to geniuses. It could be considered one of the top ten existences in the Immortal World. Before attaining the Dao, he was also at the top of the Heavenly Dao Providence Board, but the Sage position was not so easy to obtain. How many Pseudo-Sages were watching?
 Heavenly Venerate Wufa told him directly that he chose him because he valued the karma between him and Han Jue.
 The future Heavenly Dao would be the Heavenly Dao with the surname Han. Heavenly Venerate Wufa needed Zhang Guxing to join forces with him and climb up under Han Jue, fighting for more power and Han Jue‚Äôs trust.
 There would be power struggles even in the grand unification. This was vividly displayed in the mortal empire.
 Han Jue asked Long Hao to stand up and nodded at Zhang Guxing as a greeting.
 As for the Primordial Chaos Buddha, he pretended not to know him.
 Primordial Chaos Buddha immediately understood.
 Master wants me to continue pretending.
 After the Sages sat down, Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du‚Äôs expression turned solemn as he said, ‚ÄúThe Divine Robe Daoist isn‚Äôt dead. He has reappeared. Not long ago, he defeated the Great Dao Divine Spirit who wanted to occupy his territory. This battle has already alarmed the Chaos.‚Äù
 Hearing this, all the Sages looked at Han Jue.
 He said indifferently, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry. The Divine Robe Daoist won‚Äôt attack the Heavenly Dao again.‚Äù
 The Sages heaved a sigh of relief.
 Heavenly Venerate Wufa smiled. ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt dare either if I were him.‚Äù
 Qiu Xilai, Sect Master Tian Jue, and Fang Liang understood the truth and nodded.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du‚Äôs expression softened.
 Li Taigu suddenly asked, ‚ÄúSenior Han, can‚Äôt Great Dao Sages be killed?‚Äù He asked the question that the other Sages wanted to ask.
 The Great Dao Realm was too mysterious to them. There were no legends even in the Heavenly Dao.
 Han Jue said, ‚ÄúThe Great Dao Sages are indeed considered undying and indestructible. They can‚Äôt be killed unless your Dharmic powers surpass theirs. However, are there any realms above the Great Dao Realm?‚Äù
 The Sages subconsciously shook their heads.
 They couldn‚Äôt imagine how he was stronger than the Great Dao Sage.
 The other Sages nodded in agreement.
 This matter was quickly settled without any obstruction.
 Heavenly Venerate Xuan Du continued, ‚ÄúRecently, a Human Emperor has appeared in the Heavenly Dao. He wants to use the power of humans to unite the Heavenly Dao. It seems to be harming the Heavenly Dao‚Äôs peace. What do you think?‚Äù
 Fang Liang frowned. ‚ÄúIf we directly suppress them, I‚Äôm afraid someone in the Human Race will use this matter to incite trouble.‚Äù
 Primordial Chaos Buddha said, ‚ÄúLure the Buddhist Sect into the Human Race and teach them with Buddhist principles.‚Äù
 Qiu Xilai glanced at him. This junior was good. He knew how to take advantage of the situation.


 Han Jue didn‚Äôt care. That Human Emperor couldn‚Äôt represent the entire Human Race.
 The Human Race was a Heavenly Dao Race, but the Human Emperor was not the protagonist of the Heavenly Dao.
 Hundreds of thousands of years of peace had made mortals forget their reverence. This was understandable.
 Han Jue was bored. After knowing that there was nothing serious, he stood up and left.
 The Sages did not stop him and heaved a sigh of relief.
 With Han Jue around, they would always be worried about his position. Han Jue stood up and left, indicating that he didn‚Äôt care about this at all.
  Thinking about it, it made sense. What was Han Jue‚Äôs identity?
 After he left, Jin Shen said directly, ‚ÄúHe went against the Heavenly Dao and wants to disturb peace. Kill him directly and change the Human Emperor.‚Äô
 Li Taigu said, ‚ÄúI suggest we supervise the Human Emperor Temple. After all, the Human Race is a Heavenly Dao Race. Without the support of the Human Emperor Temple, how can the Human Race dare to be so rampant?‚Äù
 Fang Liang said, ‚ÄúThe Human Race currently lacks standards. The Human Emperor chose someone with a powerful cultivation level and not a Sage. I know a human genius who has the power to conquer the world and also has very good potential.‚Äù
 The Sages might have turned a blind eye if it was before the previous calamity.
 However, the Heavenly Dao wanted to develop and explore the Chaos. If the interior fell into chaos, it would definitely cause the cultivators exploring the Chaos to be in confusion.
 Buzhou Divine Mountain.
 Han Yu sat under an old tree. The scenery at the top of Buzhou Divine Mountain was very beautiful. Looking along the cliff, the continuous ridge emerged from the clouds like the spine of a dragon. It was vast and majestic.
 Han Yu, who was cultivating under the tree, did not move. His white clothes were spotless and he looked peaceful.
 At this moment.
 A figure appeared in front of him.
 It was Long Hao.
 He was not the main body, but a phantom.
 Han Yu opened his eyes and looked at him. ‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù
 Long Hao smiled. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre really cold. Can‚Äôt I visit you for no reason? I‚Äôm a Sage now. Aren‚Äôt you going to bow?‚Äù
 Han Yu rolled his eyes and ignored him.
 Long Hao didn‚Äôt dare to be angry when he saw his face, so he naturally did not mind. He smiled and said, ‚ÄúNow that you are the Great Ancestor of the Human Race, are you willing to stand up and lead them?‚Äù
 Han Yu frowned. ‚ÄúDid the current Human Emperor cause trouble?‚Äù
 Clearly, he had heard of the Human Race.
 Long Hao said, ‚ÄúIn the Human Race Ceremony hundreds of years ago, the Human Emperor declared that humans are above Sages and that the race should unite the heavens. Don‚Äôt you think this is dangerous?‚Äù
 It would be fine if a mortal had said that. There were many arrogant people in the world, but as the Human Emperor, that was not appropriate.
 Han Yu frowned even more and shook his head. ‚ÄúForget it. I have no intention of entering the world. Find someone else.‚Äù
 He paused and continued, ‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù
 Long Hao had already attained the Dao, but he still cared about him. He was touched.
 There were many experts and geniuses in the Dragon Race. Long Hao was not invincible.
 Long Hao looked at Han Yu deeply and said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not bad. Perhaps in the future, you will surpass the imagination of the world.‚Äù
 With that, he vanished.
 Han Yu was confused and did not understand what he meant.
 Since he couldn‚Äôt figure it out, he stopped thinking about it. Han Yu closed his eyes and continued cultivating.
 He had already let go of his emotions and desires, let go of the mortal world. He only wanted to cultivate quietly and alone in the long years.
 It wasn‚Äôt a bad thing to enjoy loneliness.
 Another ten thousand years passed.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and looked at the Immortal World.
  The Human Race was still around. Under the schemes of the Sages, a new Human Emperor overthrew the previous Human Emperor thousands of years ago. Now, he led the Human Race to develop in peace. Peace returned to the Immortal World.
 This matter had already been forgotten by all the living beings in the Heavenly Dao. Something new would happen every year. Who would remember what happened in the
 past?
 The current Heavenly Dao was still in the era of geniuses. Most of the people recorded in the history books were geniuses. Geniuses had a new standard. Other than potential, they also had to have Heavenly Dao merit.
 Heavenly Dao merit was needed to contribute to all living beings and the Heavenly Dao.
 Han Jue‚Äôs gaze landed on the Reroll World.
 Because of him, the Reroll World had been well taken care of. It had always been second only to the Loose Heaven Realm in all these years in the heavens.
 The Loose Heaven Realm also took good care of the Reroll World. After all, it was not a secret that Great Loose Heaven had joined the Hidden Sect.
 With the huge providence of the Reroll World, the White-Robed Buddha was already a Pseudo-Sage, but he had always been an early-stage Pseudo-Sage. It was very difficult for him to increase his cultivation.
 After observing the Heavenly Dao, Han Jue started to check his emails.
 [Your good friend Di Jiang was attacked by your son Han Tuo.)
 (Your disciple Zhou Fan was attacked by your good friend Empress Houtu.]
 (Your good friend Evil Heavenly Emperor was attacked by your good friend Zhu Jiuyin.]
 (Your good friend Pan Xin was attacked by a mighty figure and was severely injured.]
 [Your grand-disciple Chu Shiren established the Buddhist World and his cultivation increased greatly.]
 [Your good friend Li Daokong has received guidance from your good friend Ancestor Xitian. His cultivation has increased greatly.]
 The Heavenly Court and the Great Dao Tower were fighting with the twelve Ancestral Magi?
 Han Jue noticed that no one on both sides had died. It seemed that it was not to the point of no return.
 He couldn‚Äôt be bothered to mediate. If something happened, the unlucky ones would be the twelve Ancestral Magi.
 Not all good friends were true friends.
 This is my son‚Äôs Mystical Power!
 Han Jue noticed Li Daokong and Ancestor Xitian next.
 The two of them had established a relationship in the Life faction?
 Why wasn‚Äôt Shi Dudao helped by Ancestor Xitian?
 Thinking of Shi Dudao, Han Jue suddenly felt that he had neglected him.
 After reading the emails, Han Jue sent a dream to Shi Dudao in the image of the Dark Forbidden Lord.
 The dream was a dark starry sky. The two of them stood beside a sun.
 Shi Dudao opened his eyes and was pleasantly surprised to see a mysterious figure that was as black as a shadow.
 ‚ÄúGreetings, Dark Forbidden Lord!‚Äù
 Shi Dudao immediately knelt down on one knee and cupped his fists.
  Han Jue said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been hard on you all these
 years.‚Äù
 Shi Dudao suppressed his excitement and said, ‚ÄúNo, I have to thank you!‚Äù
 Han Jue said, ‚ÄúIt looks dangerous, but it might also be an opportunity. Use it well. I‚Äôll make a move when it‚Äôs time. If I don‚Äôt appear, it means that the time isn‚Äôt right.‚Äù
 Shi Dudao nodded. He understood what he meant.
 Just as he had guessed, Life was created by the Dark Forbidden Lord. All of this was just a facade.
 Thinking of this, Shi Dudao respected the Dark Forbidden Lord even more. The fact that the Dark Forbidden Lord could visit him in his dreams and tell him the truth meant that he trusted him.
 He would do anything for the Dark Forbidden Lord!


 Han Jue sighed after the dream ended. ‚ÄúShi Dudao is not bad. I can focus on nurturing him in the future. He has patience and determination. His future is limitless.‚Äù
 He would observe for hundreds of thousands of years first.
 Currently, Life was still fearless. It seemed that no force could restrain them. The Great Dao Divine Spirits did not move, either.
 Han Jue came to the second Dao Field and released Dao Comprehension Sword.
 Their appearance alerted Li Yao.
  Li Yao opened her eyes and saw Dao Comprehension Sword. She immediately looked happy.
 Dao Comprehension Sword slowly opened her eyes. Seeing Han Jue and Li Yao, she couldn‚Äôt help but be in a daze.
 During the fusion process, Han Jue was busy cultivating and ignored her, causing her to be in a deep sleep. Because it was too painful, she could only numb herself with sleep.
 She was not dead? She had been reborn?
 They had known each other for hundreds of thousands of years and had established the Holy Mother Sect together. Their relationship was naturally good.
 Dao Comprehension Sword‚Äôs beautiful face instantly turned red.
 Han Jue added, ‚ÄúStay here from now on.‚Äù
 With that, he returned to the main Dao Field.
 Once he left, Dao Comprehension Sword heaved a sigh of relief and regained her nature. She looked at Li Yao and asked curiously, ‚ÄúHow can Master transform people into Chaotic Fiendcelestials? Chaotic Fiendcelestials are the top potential in the legends of the Chaos.‚Äù
 How many secrets was Master hiding?
 She covered the second Dao Field with her divine sense and felt powerful auras that were not inferior to hers!
 This power was much stronger than the Hidden Sect!
 After releasing Dao Comprehension Sword, Han Jue entered cultivation again.
 Cultivation was endless. In the eyes of Sages, time was nothing. Longevity was sometimes boring. Year after year passed.
 Tens of thousands of years later.
 [Detected that you are 700,000 years old and your life has taken another step forward. You have the following choices:]
 (1: Exit seclusion immediately and spread the name of the Primordial Fiendcelestial, stirring up the Great Dao Immeasurable Calamity. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment, a Creation Spirit Stone, and a Heavenly Dao Spirit Stone.]
 [2: Cultivate in a low-profile manner and stay away from trouble. You can obtain a Great Dao Fragment, a Creation Spirit Stone, and a Supreme Treasure.]
 It was the same as the 600,000 years old option. Han Jue directly chose the second option.
 (Congratulations on obtaining the Chaotic Supreme Treasure‚ÄîThree Thousand Heavenly Dragon Ribbon)
 [Three Thousand Heavenly Dragon Ribbon: Defensive Chaotic Supreme Treasure. It is formed by the providence of 3,000 Chaotic Heavenly Dragons. It contains extremely strong defense and can block Great Dao attacks. It can isolate the damage of karma and negative karma.)
 Great!
 Another defensive Supreme Treasure!
 With four defensive Supreme Treasures, even a Great Dao Supreme could not insta-kill him!
 Right!
 Han Jue asked in his mind.
 (500 billion years of lifespan will be deducted. Do you want to continue?]
 Continue!
 [Yes, you can‚Äôt be insta-killed.)
 The corners of Han Jue‚Äôs mouth curled up. Then, he took out the Three Thousand Heavenly Dragon Ribbon and started refining it.
  The refinement was successful after eighty years.
 The three thousand dragons automatically wrapped around Han Jue. They followed his waist and wrapped around his arms. The two ends landed behind him. Golden light burst out and dragon shadows appeared behind him. The dragons twisted and their divine might was vast.
 Han Jue immediately entered the simulation trial and challenged the Foolish Sword Sage.
 He stood still and let the Foolish Sword Sage hit him.
 The Foolish Sword Sage still couldn‚Äôt break through his defense even after an hour. Han Jue took out the Heaven-Opening Axe and insta-killed him.
 Boring.
 Han Jue opened his eyes and sighed.
 None of them could fight!
 Then, he fused the Creation Spirit Stone with the Scarlet Clear Fiendcelestial.
 In a vast hall, the Evil Heavenly Emperor stood in front of a huge cauldron.
 Han Tuo sat in the boiling medicine inside the cauldron. He was frowning and his expression was ugly.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor‚Äôs eyes were filled with worry.
 At this moment, the Great Dao Concealment Fiendcelestial‚Äôs voice sounded, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry. I‚Äôve already removed the spatial power in his body.‚Äù
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor grumbled, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve already said that we‚Äôre not Di Jiang‚Äôs match, let alone the other Ancestral Magi. Especially that Time Ancestral Magus, Zhu Jiuyin, who‚Äôs invincible in the Freedom Realm.‚Äù
 The Great Dao Concealment Fiendcelestial was silent.
 After a long while‚Ä¶
 He said faintly, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt expect Di Jiang to be so powerful. It seems that Pangu‚Äôs providence is protecting them.‚Äù
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor snorted. ‚ÄúThen, do you still want us to continue fighting the twelve Ancestral Magi? My Heavenly Court will be destroyed if we continue.‚Äù
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor immediately smiled. ‚ÄúThank you for your understanding, Senior.‚Äù
 The Great Dao Concealment Fiendcelestial did not appear. It was unknown what his expression was.
 After a while, the Great Dao Concealment Fiendcelestial suddenly asked, ‚ÄúHow has Han Jue been recently? Why isn‚Äôt there any movement from him?‚Äù
 The current Heavenly Dao had already established itself in the Chaos. Its development was very ferocious and would surpass the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End sooner or later.
 ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs most likely cultivating in seclusion. I know him too well.‚Äù The Evil Heavenly Emperor smiled.
 The Great Dao Concealment Fiendcelestial asked curiously, ‚ÄúWhy is he cultivating so hard? He doesn‚Äôt seem to have any goals.‚Äù
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor said, ‚ÄúCultivation is the goal.‚Äù
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor frowned. ‚ÄúWhat do you want? Don‚Äôt think about using any opportunities to attract his help. He‚Äôs most afraid of trouble.‚Äù
 The Great Dao Concealment Fiendcelestial said helplessly, ‚ÄúWhy do you keep speaking up for him? I treat you well. Why don‚Äôt you think about me?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre like father and son. Why fuss about this?‚Äù
 Silence returned to the hall.
 The Evil Heavenly Emperor‚Äôs gaze landed on Han Tuo again.
 In the darkness, a coffin moved quickly.
  A figure sat on the coffin. It was Huang Zuntian.
 Huang Zuntian looked ahead and asked softly, ‚ÄúWhere are we going?‚Äù A voice came from his body, low and hoarse, ‚ÄúAncient Desolate.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúHelp us activate the Primordial Chaos Tablet. It is a Supreme Treasure born at the beginning of the Chaos. It is not inferior to Pangu‚Äôs Heaven-Opening Axe. With it, you will truly rise.‚Äù
 Huang Zuntian raised his eyebrows. He was naturally familiar with the Heaven-Opening Axe.
 That was a Supreme Treasure that Pan Xin was most proud of. Back then, Pan Xin had relied on the Heaven-Opening Axe to break through the Deity Realm of the Ruins of End. Even now, his achievements were still very terrifying
 Huang Zuntian asked, ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt the Ancient Desolate dangerous?‚Äù
 Primordial Origin replied, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve calculated. The Ancient Desolate is relatively safe during this period of time. Those terrifying existences have already left. After arriving there, look away when you see tombstones and mirages. Don‚Äôt provoke them.‚Äù


 Huang Zuntian asked, ‚ÄúWhat is the strongest existence in the Ancient Desolate?‚Äù
 Primordial Origin was silent.
 Huang Zuntian waited for a moment and asked again, ‚ÄúWhy aren‚Äôt you saying anything?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt say his name and break the taboo. Kid, remember, the Chaos is not as simple as you think. All living beings are in the illusion. There are some things that you can‚Äôt ask or remember.‚Äù
 Primordial Origin‚Äôs tone was filled with emotions as if he had fallen into endless memories.
  Huang Zuntian was even more curious, but he did not ask, afraid that it would cause trouble.
 The longer he spent with Primordial Origin, the more curious he became about the Chaos.
 How was such a vast Chaos born?
 What was before the Chaos?
 Was the Great Dao Realm really the end of cultivation?
 I can‚Äôt escape the Chaos by cultivating?
 Huang Zuntian felt that many secrets were worth exploring other than pursuing strength in the path of cultivation.
 ‚Ä¶
 Time passed.
 Eighty thousand years passed.
 He cultivated for 80,000 years without anyone disturbing him.
 This time, when he woke up and looked back, his cultivation level had increased greatly.
 Han Jue suddenly had a bold thought.
 He wanted to enter seclusion and break through in one go!
 However, this was not good. If too much time passed, the Heavenly Dao would probably change drastically and even escape his control.
 Perhaps he could rely on his absolute strength to suppress it again, but it would still be troublesome.
 Han Jue first came to the second Dao Field and released Scarlet Clear Fiendcelestial to let Murong Qi receive him.
 After the two fiendcelestials left, Han Jue looked at Li Yao and Dao Comprehension Sword.
 The two women meditated side by side. They had their own styles and were devastatingly beautiful.
 Han Jue paid attention to their cultivation. The Great Dao he had fused with Dao Comprehension Sword was the Great Dao of Sword. He could already feel a sword Qi nurturing in her.
 This sword Qi was very strong. Although it had yet to attain the Dao, it was already not inferior to a Sage who had just attained the Dao.
 While Han Jue was sizing them up, they were also looking at him.
 Wearing four Chaotic Supreme Treasures, Han Jue‚Äôs temperament stunned them.
 They had never seen such a handsome person. Even though he was already the person they were most familiar with, his bearing still fascinated them.
 Li Yao said, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go yet.‚Äù
 Han Jue asked, ‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù
 Li Yao glanced at Dao Comprehension Sword and said, ‚ÄúWe have questions about cultivation that we want to ask you.‚Äù
 Han Jue nodded and sat down.
 The three of them began to discuss the Dao.
  Fifty years passed quickly.
 Han Jue returned to the main Dao Field and smiled.
 ‚ÄúThese two girls are not bad. They didn‚Äôt disappoint me.‚Äù
 Han Jue began to look forward to Li Yao and Dao Comprehension Sword‚Äôs future.
 Then, he began to check his emails.
 After 80,000 years, the number of emails had already reached a terrifying number. However, as a Great Dao Sage, Han Jue easily read all of them.
 Recently, Chu Shiren had been quite active. After this fellow attained the Dao, his cultivation level increased very quickly and he had already reached the mid-stage Primordial Chaos Zenith Heaven Golden Immortal Realm.
 Han Jue decided to visit Chu Shiren in his dreams.
 The dream was under the Fusang Tree, filled with nostalgia.
 Chu Shiren opened his eyes and was indeed stunned by what he saw.
 To Han Jue, his departure might have been a few days ago, but to him, the experiences contained in hundreds of thousands of years were endless.
 Seeing Han Jue, Chi Shiren immediately woke up and knelt down.
 He wore the Time Dao Robe and the Grand Primordium Divine Crown on his head, the Chaotic Diamond Bracelet in his hand, and the Three Thousand Heavenly Dragon Ribbon wrapped around his body. Han Jue‚Äôs image and temperament had reached the extreme. The three thousand dragon shadows swayed behind him, causing Chu Shiren to be filled with reverence.
 No wonder he could kill a Great Dao Divine Spirit!
 This temperament was even more powerful than the Great Dao Divine Spirit in Chu Shiren‚Äôs imagination.
 Han Jue smiled and asked, ‚ÄúNot bad. You actually created your own Great Dao and even created a world. You‚Äôre indeed my most highly regarded disciple.‚Äù
 Hearing this, Chu Shiren immediately became excited. Usually, he was extremely calm when facing anyone. Only when facing Han Jue would he always be like a junior.
 ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all thanks to Grandmaster that I can be where I am today,‚Äù said Chu Shiren, suppressing his surprise. Han Jue had said this to him before. He was not touched for long. After calming down, he felt that Han Jue was coaxing him.
 From the looks of it, all of this was within Han Jue‚Äôs expectations.
 He had heard that a Great Dao Sage could see through one‚Äôs future and fate.
 Chu Shiren nodded. Then, he felt an irresistible force lifting him up. He began to talk about his experience creating the Buddhist World.
 He spoke for several hours.
 The development of the Buddhist World was not bad. It was not purely an independent world. It was more like a sect that established connections with many worlds. The Buddhist World‚Äôs disciples were all cultivators who wandered in the Chaos. After learning the Buddhist Dharma, they began to wander the Chaos and expiate the suffering of living beings.
 Chu Shiren spoke very proudly. He felt that his Buddhist World was more Buddhist-like than the Heavenly Dao Buddhist Sect.
 A true Buddha should cultivate to save all living beings from suffering, not fight for power.
 Han Jue smiled. ‚ÄúNot bad. I‚Äôm very satisfied that you didn‚Äôt forget your original intention. However, the Chaos is still the Chaos. Sometimes, don‚Äôt trust others too much. If you encounter trouble, remember to contact the Hidden Sect. Although you created your own Buddhist World, you didn‚Äôt leave the Hidden Sect, right?‚Äù
 Chu Shiren was shocked. ‚ÄúGrand-disciple will always be a disciple of the Hidden Sect!‚Äù
 Han Jue smiled and nodded. Then, he began to preach in his dream.
 It just so happened that Chu Shiren was in seclusion and did not need to end the dream immediately.
  Ten years later.
 Han Jue opened his eyes. He suddenly felt that Chu Shiren might really have the best potential.
 He discovered that after Chu Shiren listened to the Dao seriously, his understanding of the Great Dao of Extreme Origin was very deep. If there was a path of cultivation for the Great Dao of Extreme Origin, Chu Shiren would already be ahead of many disciples. There was no lack of people whose cultivation level surpassed his. For example, Zhou Fan‚Äôs understanding of the Great Dao of Extreme Origin was inferior to Chu Shiren‚Äôs.
 Most importantly, Chu Shiren had a kind heart.
 Han Jue smiled and stopped thinking about it.
 He was about to cultivate when he suddenly felt something and looked up at the Chaotic Heavenly Road.
 Great Dao Sage!
